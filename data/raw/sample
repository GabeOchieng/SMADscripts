KABUL, Afghanistan -- A British soldier who was helping to build new quarters for the Afghan National Army at a small base in southern Afghanistan was fatally shot by an Afghan soldier in the first insider attack of 2013, military officials said Tuesday.
The attacker, who struck on Monday evening, also shot and wounded six other British soldiers in the engineering regiment, three of them seriously, before being killed, Afghan and British officials said. 
During the attack, which occurred at Camp Hazrat, a joint patrol base in the Nahr-e-Seraj District of Helmand Province, several Afghan soldiers were also shot at but were not wounded, said Maj. Gen. Sayed Maluk, the commanding general of the Afghan Army's 215 Corps, in a statement to the British Forces Broadcasting Service, an arm of the British Defense Ministry.
''It was the British team that sustained injuries,'' General Maluk said. ''Unfortunately, they were engineering personnel, and they were building billeting for the A.N.A.''
He said the Afghan Army was doing everything it could to prevent such attacks. Until 2011, insider attacks, also known as ''green on blue'' attacks, were a relatively minor problem for the Western military forces in Afghanistan.
But last year, 62 international troops and civilian contractors died in attacks by Afghan forces. Two additional attacks are still under investigation.
Many in the military see the escalation as a game changer that requires Western troops to stay at arm's length from the Afghans they are supposed to be training and mentoring.
At one point late last summer, Gen. John R. Allen, the commander for international forces in Afghanistan, temporarily suspended joint patrols unless they were approved at the highest levels because of the risk.
Members of NATO units were required to carry weapons with a loaded magazine, and each unit assigned some troops as ''guardian angels'' to protect fellow soldiers from insider attacks during meetings with Afghans as well as on patrol.
The Afghan Defense Ministry overhauled its screening process for new recruits and rescreened those already deployed.
''Prior to this incident happening we have done almost everything that we can,'' General Maluk said.
He said Afghan soldiers have been told by religious leaders inside the corps that the coalition forces ''are not invaders, they are our friendly forces; they are not here to invade, but rather they are here to help us reconstruct this country.''
''But to them, the enemy is the enemy,'' he said.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for arranging the infiltration into the Afghan Army of the soldier responsible for Monday's shooting.
A Taliban spokesman, Qari Yusuf, said that the attacker's name was Mohammed Qasim and that Mr. Qasim had ''fulfilled his blessed duty.''
Mr. Qasim, who was 23 to 25 years old and was known as Sheik Mohammed by his fellow soldiers, was a reticent young man who came from eastern Afghanistan, said Col. Abdul Saboor, an officer with the 215 Corps.
The sequence of events that led to the attack is still unclear, but it seems that the attacker, Mr. Qasim, was on guard duty in a tower as punishment for an infraction and initially began shooting at his Afghan compatriots. It is not clear if Mr. Qasim intended to kill them or whether it was a ploy to draw the British troops closer so that he could target them more easily.

Cuomo to Press For Wider Curbs Over Gun Access

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 1105 words

ALBANY -- Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, pushing New York to become the first state to enact major new gun laws in the wake of the massacre in Newtown, Conn., plans on Wednesday to propose one of the country's most restrictive bans on assault weapons.
New York is one of seven states that already ban at least some assault weapons. But Mr. Cuomo has described the existing law as having ''more holes than Swiss cheese,'' and he wants to broaden the number of guns and magazines covered by the law while also making it harder for gun makers to tweak their products to get around the ban.
Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, will outline his proposal in his State of the State address, but even before he speaks, he has incited anxiety among gun owners by acknowledging in a radio interview that ''confiscation could be an option'' for assault weapons owned by New Yorkers. Since that interview, Mr. Cuomo has not mentioned the idea, and his aides have acknowledged that it would be impractical.
But gun rights groups have seized on the comment, even promoting a petition on the Web site of the White House that declares, ''We do not live in Nazi Germany,'' and asks the Obama administration to block any effort at confiscation by Mr. Cuomo. 
Since the shootings in Newtown, Mr. Cuomo has been trying to negotiate an agreement on gun laws with legislative leaders in Albany -- he even contemplated calling them back into special session last month -- and the talks continued into Tuesday, as the governor sought an agreement before his speech.
According to people briefed on the talks, the governor is considering not only rewriting the state's assault weapons ban, but also proposing more expansive use of mental health records in background checks of gun buyers, lower limits on the capacity of magazines sold legally in New York and a new requirement that gun permits be subject to periodic recertification.
New York already has some of the toughest gun laws in the country, and the debate over new restrictions here reflects a significant change in the national conversation over guns, as states and the federal government grapple with whether and how to limit the possession of weapons that have been used in multiple mass killings in recent years.
Mr. Cuomo, a shotgun owner, has long spoken in favor of tougher gun control but has not used his considerable political muscle to make the issue a priority over his two years as governor. Now, citing the recent killings, he is seeking to strike a deal that could be used as a model in other statehouses.
''I think what the nation is saying now after Connecticut, what people in New York are saying is 'Do something, please,' '' Mr. Cuomo told reporters recently.
New York's existing assault weapons ban was approved in the aftermath of another mass shooting, at Columbine High School in 1999. The next year, Gov. George E. Pataki surprised his fellow Republicans by pushing through the Legislature a package of tough new gun laws, including the measure to outlaw assault weapons. But many high-powered rifles now in production are exempt from the ban because, advocacy groups say, manufacturers have altered their products to circumvent the law.
''This is a singular moment in the history of the gun control movement,'' said Richard M. Aborn, the president of the Citizens Crime Commission of New York City. ''The governor has the opportunity to set the high-water mark and continue New York's leadership position in having the most effective gun control laws in the country.''
The state's District Attorneys Association sent a letter to the governor and legislative leaders on Tuesday calling for, among other things, the elimination of a grandfather clause that allows some high-capacity magazines. And nearly 100 lawmakers have endorsed a set of proposals that includes limiting handgun purchases to one per month, requiring a new form of ballistics identification and putting in place universal background checks.
But Mr. Cuomo faces a complicated political landscape in Albany. The Assembly is controlled by Democrats who are eager for more gun restrictions, while the Senate this year is to be controlled by an unusual coalition of Republicans, who have largely resisted new gun laws, and dissident Democrats, who support more gun control. Mr. Cuomo, during his first half of his term, assiduously courted Senate Republicans, even persuading them to allow the vote that legalized same-sex marriage, but he has indicated that he is now willing to challenge the Republicans over the gun issue.
On Saturday, after the Senate Republicans called for stiffening penalties for violations of existing gun laws, but not tightening the assault weapons ban, Mr. Cuomo's spokesman said the Republican proposal ''insults the common sense of New Yorkers.''
Gun rights advocates argue that Mr. Cuomo is wrong to focus his attention on assault weapons; of 769 homicides in New York State in 2011, only five were committed with rifles of any kind, according to the State Division of Criminal Justice Services.
''This issue is not about guns, and the reason they are pushing the gun issue is because it's much easier for them to say, 'Look what we did; we're going to make people safer in New York. We passed more gun laws,' '' said Thomas H. King, the president of the New York State Rifle and Pistol Association. Mr. King, echoing the recommendation of the National Rifle Association, said that instead of banning certain guns, New York should require armed security at all schools.
Senator Catharine Young, Republican of Olean, in western New York, said she had been receiving calls from constituents who were worried about what action the Legislature might take.
''The vast majority of people who own firearms in my district are law-abiding and extremely responsible,'' Ms. Young said. ''They aren't the problem; it's illegal guns and untreated mental illness that are the problems.''
Cracking down on high-powered weapons has long been a priority for many urban Democrats in the Legislature; to draw attention to the issue, one senator even went to a gun shop near Albany to buy ammunition for an AK-47 while the transaction was recorded with a hidden camera.
''A lot of people look at this as a battle between people who want to take away all the guns and people who want to have no restrictions on guns; but most members of the public and most members of the Legislature understand that reasonable restrictions on guns make sense,'' said Assemblyman Brian Kavanagh, a Manhattan Democrat. Last weekend, he said, brought another reminder of the urgency at hand: a 16-year-old from Mr. Kavanagh's district was shot dead on Friday.

F.B.I. Says Suspect Planned Explosions

BYLINE: By DAN FROSCH

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 11

LENGTH: 612 words

CENTENNIAL, Colo. -- If all had gone according to James E. Holmes's plan, someone would have tripped the labyrinthine nest of explosives he had woven around his apartment, luring the police from the Aurora movie theater where he is accused of opening fire last July, an F.B.I. agent testified Tuesday.
During a second day of testimony in a preliminary hearing for Mr. Holmes, who is accused of killing 12 people and wounding more than 50, Special Agent Garrett Gumbinner recounted how Mr. Holmes, a former neuroscience student, detailed to investigators his meticulous plot to blow up his apartment as a diversion. 
When the police entered the apartment after the shooting, they found a virtual death trap. A trip wire skirted five feet from the door to a thermos filled with glycerin, which tilted precariously over a pan containing another substance that could have caught fire, said Agent Gumbinner, a bomb technician.
Three jars of homemade napalm had been placed around the apartment. Firework shells filled with smokeless powder and gasoline littered the floor. The carpet was drenched with gasoline and oil, the agent testified.
''He said he had rigged his apartment to explode or catch fire in order to send resources to the apartment,'' Agent Gumbinner said.
According to testimony on Tuesday, Mr. Holmes told the police he had timed his computer to blare music, hoping to draw someone inside his home, thereby detonating the explosives.
A second triggering device was set up near a trash bin outside his apartment, Mr. Holmes reportedly told the police. As Agent Gumbinner described it, Mr. Holmes explained that he had placed the device in a garbage bag, along with a boom box and a remote-control car.
His plan was for a CD from the boom box to blast music, attracting a passer-by, who would then fidget with the remote-control car and inadvertently set off the triggering mechanism, Agent Gumbinner said.
Testimony from Tuesday's hearing for Mr. Holmes, who faces more than 160 counts of murder and attempted murder, continued to cast new light on the case, as prosecutors present evidence the public has yet to hear.
On Tuesday, Daniel King, one of Mr. Holmes's public defenders, intimated yet again that he would pursue an insanity defense for his client.
Craig Appel, the lead detective on the case, testified under cross-examination that Mr. Holmes exhibited odd behavior during his interviews with the police after the shooting, at one point pulling a staple out of a table and trying to place it into an electrical socket. The police had placed paper bags on Mr. Holmes's hands, a common procedure to preserve gunpowder residue, and officers observed Mr. Holmes playing with the bags ''in a talking puppet motion,'' Mr. Appel said.
Meanwhile, more information came to light regarding the small arsenal Mr. Holmes bought in the months before the shooting.
Steven Beggs, a special agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, testified that Mr. Holmes had bought four guns, more than 6,000 rounds of ammunition, body armor, target practice equipment and various chemicals from local stores and on the Internet.
At one point on Tuesday, prosecutors played recordings of some of the first 911 calls made that summer night last year.
On the very first call placed to the police from inside the theater, just moments after Mr. Holmes strode in through an emergency exit, the staccato pop of some 30 shots could be heard.
On another call, a teenage girl shouts to an emergency dispatcher that her two cousins had been shot. The dispatcher tries desperately to get the girl to perform CPR over the chaos inside the theater. ''I can't hear you,'' she screams.

Arizona: Giffords and Husband Start Campaign Against Gun Violence

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; NATIONAL BRIEFING | SOUTHWEST; Pg. 16

LENGTH: 149 words

Former Representative Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, Mark E. Kelly, unveiled a campaign against gun violence on Tuesday, the second anniversary of the shooting in a Tuscon shopping center that killed six people and left Ms. Giffords critically injured. In an op-ed article published in USA Today, Ms. Giffords, a Democrat, and Mr. Kelly, a former astronaut, explained that the effort, called Americans for Responsible Solutions, was intended to counter the influence of the powerful gun lobby. They said they wanted to encourage elected officials ''to prevent gun violence and protect responsible gun ownership by communicating directly with the constituents that elect them.'' They emphasized that they are strong supporters of the Second Amendment. ''We don't want to take away your guns any more than we want to give up the two guns we have locked in a safe at home,'' the couple wrote.

Police Stop-and-Frisk Program in Bronx Is Ruled Unconstitutional

BYLINE: By JOSEPH GOLDSTEIN

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 17

LENGTH: 1068 words

An element of the New York Police Department's stop-and-frisk practice was deemed unconstitutional by a federal judge on Tuesday, a ruling that may have broad implications for the city's widespread use of police stops as a crime-fighting tactic.
The decision, the first federal ruling to find that the practice under the Bloomberg administration violates the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable search and seizure, focused on police stops conducted in front of several thousand private residential buildings in the Bronx enrolled in the Trespass Affidavit Program. Property managers in that program have asked the police to patrol their buildings and to arrest trespassers. 
But the judge, Shira A. Scheindlin of Federal District Court in Manhattan, said officers were routinely stopping people outside the buildings without reasonable suspicion that they were trespassing.
''While it may be difficult to say where, precisely, to draw the line between constitutional and unconstitutional police encounters, such a line exists, and the N.Y.P.D. has systematically crossed it when making trespass stops outside TAP buildings in the Bronx,'' Judge Scheindlin ruled.
Judge Scheindlin is presiding over three significant stop-and-frisk lawsuits that could fundamentally change New York City's strategy for preventing street crimes. While the judge's decision applies to only one of the lawsuits, Ligon v. the City of New York, the cases share some core constitutional issues.
Much of the criticism in the ruling is directed at the training the Police Department provides officers, which Judge Scheindlin suggested sidesteps the Fourth Amendment.
The evidence in this case, she found, ''strengthens the conclusion that the N.Y.P.D.'s inaccurate training has taught officers the following lesson: Stop and question first, develop reasonable suspicion later.''
Christopher T. Dunn, a lawyer for the New York Civil Liberties Union, one of the groups representing the plaintiffs, said, ''If New York City has any sense, it will use this ruling as an opportunity to start a wholesale reform of stop and frisk.''
In the decision released on Tuesday, the judge ordered the police ''to cease performing trespass stops'' outside the private buildings in the program unless officers have reasonable suspicion, a legal standard that requires officers to be acting on more than just a hunch.
The fact that a person was merely seen entering or leaving a building was not enough to permit the police to stop someone, ''even if the building is located in a high-crime area, and regardless of the time of day,'' the judge ruled. Nor was it enough for an officer to conduct a stop simply because the officer had observed the person move furtively, Judge Scheindlin said. (The forms that the police fill out after each street stop offer ''furtive'' movements as a basis for the stop.)
The police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly, criticized the ruling, contending that the program, also known as Clean Halls, gave residents of the Bronx buildings ''a modicum of safety for less prosperous tenants. Their landlords explicitly requested this extra level of protection.''
''Today's decision unnecessarily interferes with the department's efforts to use all of the crime-fighting tools necessary to keep Clean Halls buildings safe and secure,'' he added.
Paul J. Browne, the department's chief spokesman, said the program led to several recent arrests for illegal guns. On Dec. 16, the police arrested a man with a handgun on the rooftop of a residential building in the Bronx.
On Nov. 21, officers recovered a handgun after observing the gun's butt protruding from a man's jacket pocket as they patrolled a fourth-floor hallway in a building on East 220th Street.
Judge Scheindlin called for a hearing to discuss possible remedies to the issues she raised. At that hearing, she said, she will consider requiring the Police Department to create a formal written policy ''specifying the limited circumstances in which it is legally permissible to stop a person outside a TAP building on a suspicion of trespass,'' revise the training of officers and alter some of the training literature and videos used to teach officers how to conduct lawful stops.
The ruling followed a seven-day hearing in October during which nine black and Latino residents testified about being stopped while leaving their homes or visiting friends and relatives as guests. With testimony by plaintiffs and police witnesses, it was the first hearing of its type in any of the three stop-and-frisk cases before Judge Scheindlin, and the testimony evidently shaped her conclusions.
''Because any member of the public could conceivably find herself outside a TAP building in the Bronx, the public at large has a liberty and dignity interest in bringing an end to the practice of unconstitutional stops at issue in this case,'' the judge wrote.
''For those of us who do not fear being stopped as we approach or leave our own homes or those of our friends and families, it is difficult to believe that residents of one of our boroughs live under such a threat. In light of the evidence presented at the hearing, however, I am compelled to conclude that this is the case.'' The judge said she considered the plaintiffs credible partly because of ''the striking similarities'' in their experiences being stopped.
As a person exits a building, the ruling said, ''the police suddenly materialize, stop the person, demand identification, and question the person about where he or she is coming from and what he or she is doing.''
The decision continued: ''Attempts at explanation are met with hostility; especially if the person is a young black man, he is frisked, which often involves an invasive search of his pockets; in some cases the officers then detain the person in a police van.''
Judge Scheindlin also expressed concern over a department training video that she said incorrectly characterized what constituted an actual police stop. In the video, a uniformed narrator states ''Usually just verbal commands such as 'Stop! Police!' will not constitute a seizure.''
The narrator explains that the encounter usually qualifies as an actual stop only if the officer takes further steps such as physically subduing a suspect, pointing a gun at him, or blocking his path. ''This misstates the law,'' Judge Scheindlin said of the video, which has been shown to most of the patrol force.

Controlling Backboards, Nets Keep Winning

BYLINE: By ZACH SCHONBRUN

SECTION: Section B; Column 0; Sports Desk; NETS 109, 76ERS 89; Pg. 15

LENGTH: 608 words

PHILADELPHIA -- The Nets needed something to readjust their focus from the distraction involving center-forward Andray Blatche on Tuesday, and it came quickly, unexpectedly, as Reggie Evans collected rebound after rebound.
Evans had nine after the first quarter, enough to generate nods of encouragement from teammates. By intermission, with 16 rebounds, the 6-foot-8 Evans had tied a franchise mark for a half, sweat barely beginning to glisten atop his shaved head.
Evans was subtle, and he scored only 2 points, but his presence was dominating in Brooklyn's 109-89 win over the Philadelphia 76ers at the Wells Fargo Center. 
The win was the Nets' fourth in a row, though it felt as though they needed to shout that distinction. Coach P. J. Carlesimo grew visibly irritated with questions before the game about Blatche, who was questioned as a witness by police after a 21-year-old woman claimed she had been sexually assaulted in a hotel suite where he was present. Television cameras were positioned outside the team hotel in downtown Philadelphia throughout the afternoon.
''Besides what was going on, we just needed to win,'' guard Deron Williams said. ''We wanted to win bad. And we played well.''
Evans, who finished with a career-high 23 rebounds despite not playing in the fourth quarter, spearheaded that effort. His rising rebounding tally became an impressive sideshow. He outrebounded Philadelphia, 7-3, in the third quarter. By the start of the fourth, Evans had nearly as many rebounds (23) as the Sixers did (24).
''Do I feel like I'm going to get every one?'' Evans said. ''When you're in the zone, you're just in the zone. If you don't get all of them, you'll get the majority of them.''
Evans finished just shy of the Nets record of 27 set by Buck Williams in a four-overtime game in 1987. ''They play a lot of small ball so you've got to want to take advantage,'' Evans said of Philadelphia.
Brooklyn outscored Philadelphia, 35-14, in the third quarter and assisted on 7 of its 14 field goals. ''That was probably the best third quarter we've had all year,'' guard Joe Johnson said.
It gave the Nets a 22-point lead they could coast with through the final 12 minutes, and some reassurance that they are hitting their stride under Carlesimo, who has helped reignite Williams.
He scored 22 points on 7-of-11 shooting and has averaged 20 points on 48.1 percent shooting this month, after scoring just 16.9 points per game on 40.8 percent shooting in December. With him, the Nets are averaging 112 points, while holding opponents to 97, during the four-game streak.
''The ball's moving, guys are hitting open shots,'' Williams said. ''It's more fun that way.''
Blatche, who scored 20 points, received some scattered boos as he entered the game with 3 minutes and 38 seconds left in the first quarter.
Blatche appeared unfazed, shooting 8 of 15 from the field with 7 rebounds. He was not available for comment before or after the game. In a statement Tuesday afternoon, Nets General Manager Billy King said the team would have no further comment until the investigation has concluded.
Carlesimo simply praised Blatche for blocking out the distraction.
''Players are very, very resilient, they really are,'' Carlesimo said. ''One of the traits of N.B.A. players is they come at 7 or 7:30 ready to play and they really don't bring any other interference into the game normally. Guys come and they play.''
REBOUNDS
Forward Kris Humphries returned to action Monday after missing the previous two games with a sprained left ankle. He scored 2 points in 10 minutes. ... Guard Jerry Stackhouse was inactive for a third consecutive game for personal reasons.

The Internationalization of Women's Issues

BYLINE: By LUISITA LOPEZ TORREGROSA

SECTION: Section ; Column 0; Foreign Desk; THE FEMALE FACTOR; Pg. 

LENGTH: 972 words

NEW YORK -- At the dawn of this new year, a note of cautious optimism is rising from female leaders, activists and advocates who are anticipating major new strides as ''women issues'' go global.
''Women issues are world issues,'' Michelle Bachelet, the executive director of U.N. Women and former president of Chile, said recently. ''Today there is greater awareness than ever before that women's full participation is essential for peace, democracy and sustainable development.''
At the same time, Alyse Nelson, chief executive of Vital Voices Global Partnership, a nongovernmental organization that trains and empowers emerging female leaders and social entrepreneurs around the globe, noted that ''the pace and nature of globalization have worn away the distinction between 'women's issues' and global issues. In 2013, women who find real solutions and leverage their leadership to empower others will rise to the international stage in increasing numbers -- and not because they're women. I believe these women are the vanguard of a new era of global leadership.'' 
A universal vision seems at work here: Elect more women as heads of state and government (there are only 21 worldwide) and to parliaments, and promote more women to corporate boards and executive positions; advance and empower women in the developed and developing world; close the gender pay gap; and improve workplace conditions.
Meantime, violence against women, a central focus of U.N. Women's agenda, has exploded as a world issue.
''In some countries, up to 7 in 10 women will be beaten, raped, abused, or mutilated during their lifetimes,'' Ms. Bachelet said. ''There can be no peace, no progress, when women live under the fear of violence.''
Indeed, Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani student shot by Taliban attackers after she spoke up on behalf of girls' education, has become a global symbol, renewing efforts to protect schoolgirls in extreme patriarchal societies.
India, the world's largest democracy, was put on notice that women would not be silent anymore. Thousands of people have joined female demonstrators against government and police mishandling of rape cases and insensitivity to women in general. Large protests over a fatal gang rape became front-page news around the world, and protesters, led by women, demanded stronger laws against rape, sexual harassment and child abuse.
With the globalization of women's issues, world organizations are drumming up the support of activists the world over, of marquee names and celebrities. At the first Trust Women conference, convened by the Thomson Reuters Foundation and the International Herald Tribune in London in December, participants and speakers -- from Queen Noor of Jordan to Christy Turlington -- debated complex issues like sexual slavery, child marriage, and the role of women in the Arab world.
Separately, the Women in the World Foundation, which will have its fourth annual conference in New York City in April, announced that a fund-raising appeal in the name of Ms. Yousafzai had collected more than $100,000 in donations that the foundation said would go toward girls' education in Pakistan and Afghanistan.
Some progress has been made on that score. ''In countries around the world, we see women's educational achievement growing to the point that in many countries, more women than men are attending university,'' says Liza Mundy, a fellow at the New America Foundation and author of ''The Richer Sex,'' about the rising number of female breadwinners. The near-fatal shooting of Ms. Yousafzai, she says, ''demonstrated the real import of schooling for girls and women, and it also shows how deeply threatening this can be to extreme traditionalists.''
Taking on another big issue, Catalyst, a nonpartisan organization for the advancement of women in business, is kicking off a plan to get more women onto corporate boards. ''We expect 2013 to be the year when momentum builds for women in leadership,'' Ilene H. Lang, Catalyst's president and chief executive, said by e-mail. ''Corporate boards are top priority.'' Women hold only 16.6 percent of Fortune 500 board seats. To help close that gender gap, Catalyst plans to enlist chief executives who would sponsor board-ready women into leadership positions. In Europe, Viviane Reding, the commissioner for justice, is leading another big push for women on boards. Allied activists have produced a register of thousands of board-ready women to counter arguments that there is a shortage of qualified candidates.
A big lift to American women came with the record number of women (20) who won seats in the U.S. Senate. The old tag ''Year of the Woman'' has been revived, and fresh momentum injected into the campaign to elect a woman president in 2016.
It's no news that Hillary Rodham Clinton -- recovering from a blood clot and other illnesses -- is the undisputed Democratic front-runner. But the names of Democratic female senators also pop up, including Kirsten E. Gillibrand of New York and the newly elected Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.
The female senators make up just 20 percent of the 100-member Senate but are drawing outsize attention. Known challenges await them in and out of Congress, like efforts to restrict abortion rights and cut back or end federal funding for women's health programs like Planned Parenthood.
Familiar issues like equal pay, workplace policies, family-work balance and political power haven't gone away in the United States or anywhere else. Basic needs and basic rights remain elusive for many women in the developing world. And those issues, too, will not go away anytime soon.
But more women in more regions of the world are stepping up and living better lives, just about everyone in the field agrees. And as the old women's issues become global, the expectations rise, and the challenges get larger.

Guns and Federal Debt Lead Agenda for Pelosi

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 14

LENGTH: 813 words

WASHINGTON -- As she begins her second Congress as leader of the opposition in the House, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California is confident that Democrats will get behind President Obama on the big clashes with Republicans. But she thinks the president should aggressively line up much wider support for raising the federal debt limit and enacting new gun rules.
''He has to communicate with the American people on it,'' Ms. Pelosi said about the debt-limit increase during an interview in which she looked ahead to the issues facing the 113th Congress. She urged the president ''to bring everyone to a place where we can say we are going to remove all doubt that the full faith and credit of the United States of America will be honored.'' 
Ms. Pelosi, 72, who is leading an expanded House minority, offered similar advice for the president in building momentum for gun restrictions in the aftermath of the Newtown, Conn., school shootings. If lawmakers balk, she said, take the issue to the public.
''There has to be a national conversation,'' said Ms. Pelosi, who was active in the House in 1994 when Congress passed an assault-weapons ban that has since expired. ''The safety of our country cannot go as slow as the slowest ship in the House of Representatives or even the United States Senate.''
''If we come out of the Newtown experience and all we do is talk about it and not have a result,'' she added, ''that would be a dereliction of duty on the part of us in public office. We must find a place where we can come to agreement on this.''
With the year-end fiscal pileup over taxes and spending concluded after Democrats provided the majority of support for House passage, Ms. Pelosi enters the latest Congress with 49 new Democrats and a net gain of 8 seats in the November elections. She said the infusion of new blood in the rank-and-file has brought energy and gives Democrats a ''fresh start.'' Over all, Republicans outnumber Democrats in the new House, 233 to 200, with 2 vacancies.
After prompting some discussion that she might retire after Democrats failed to retake the House in November, Ms. Pelosi, who served as the first female speaker from 2007 to 2011, gave no impression that she is winding down as she enthusiastically gamed out the policy that will figure into the coming months as well as the politics.
''While I'm in it, I'm in it,'' she said ''When I go, I'll go.'' She is far from ready to say that she will go.
''We just finished a lame-duck session,'' she said. ''I don't want to be a lame-duck leader.''
The president's party traditionally takes a hammering in the midterm election of second term, but Ms. Pelosi is cautious about making presumptions about 2014, particularly given the fundamental changes in political communications and strategy.
''Any assumption of past performance when it comes to elections in this day and age is stale,'' said Ms. Pelosi, who said she would make her judgment on the electoral landscape about a year from the election.
Given the issues in Washington, plenty could change between now and then with Congress veering toward multiple fiscal showdowns as well as difficult debates over gun control and immigration law.
Ms. Pelosi said she and her fellow Democrats wholeheartedly support the president's declaration that he will not horse trade with Republicans over the need to raise the debt limit as early as next month.
''It is bigger than just the accounting, it is about who we are as a country, how we professionally deal with the challenges,'' she said.
Democrats are willing to entertain spending cuts, she said, but the reductions need to be considered separately from the debt-limit discussion. And cuts that go too deep or are aimed at the wrong programs can, she said, hurt the nation in crucial areas like education, technology, science and energy.
On gun rights, Ms. Pelosi said Democrats are no longer talking about gun control but refer instead to what she calls gun violence prevention -- an effort by Democrats and their allies to find a less politically charged term, one that suggests a broader range of approaches beyond simply gun regulation.
She called it challenging to balance the rights of gun ownership with public safety and security but said Congress needed to find a way to reach consensus.
''We have to prioritize, get the votes and do something,'' said Ms. Pelosi, who identified limits on high-capacity ammunition magazines as one area that Democrats would explore.
She acknowledged a strong sentiment in Congress against gun law changes as well as the political risks usually associated with taking votes on gun restrictions. But in light of the Connecticut shooting, she said she expected the weight of public opinion to push Congress in the direction of new laws.
''I think you are going to see something outside of Washington have an impact on what happens inside of Washington,'' she said.

After Losing His Cool, Anthony May Lose Time

BYLINE: By NATE TAYLOR; Peter May contributed reporting from Boston.

SECTION: Section B; Column 0; Sports Desk; Pg. 15

LENGTH: 840 words

GREENBURGH, N.Y. -- Carmelo Anthony said he was wrong. He said he played Monday night's game against the Boston Celtics out of character. About 15 hours after he lost his cool and put himself in line for a possible suspension, Anthony acknowledged on Tuesday that he allowed trash talking from Kevin Garnett to get to him in a nasty-edged contest that the Knicks lost to their Atlantic Division rivals.
''I lost my composure yesterday,'' Anthony said to reporters after the Knicks' practice. ''I accept that. But there are certain things that push certain people's buttons.'' 
But what exactly they were, what Garnett might have said, Anthony did not want to address, although he offered hints.
''It's certain things that you just don't say to men,'' Anthony said. ''But we're both at an understanding right now. That situation has been handled.''
It was handled, Anthony said, because he and Garnett finally did talk, although Anthony wouldn't say where or when. But that conversation took place only after a shouting and cursing Anthony first tried to confront Garnett outside the Celtics' locker room after Monday's game and then tried to get to him again as Garnett and his teammates were boarding their team bus outside Madison Square Garden.
Anthony said he sought out Garnett because he wanted to talk things through like ''grown men.'' But he created a volatile situation that required the intervention of security guards, police officers and even Knicks Coach Mike Woodson and teammate J. R. Smith to keep Anthony away from Garnett.
Although he was the clear aggressor in the postgame uproar, Anthony said he hoped he would not receive a suspension from the N.B.A., which is investigating what occurred.
''Nothing happened for me to be suspended,'' he said. ''I went and wanted to talk to K. G. I think it was something we both needed to get off our chests and really see what the problem was.''
Even Boston Coach Doc Rivers, who was upset with Anthony after the game, said on Tuesday that he did not think Anthony deserved a suspension.
''I think the fans pay and buy tickets to watch the players play, not be suspended,'' Rivers said after the Celtics practiced in Boston. ''No matter how bad things are, I think the fans still pay to watch the guys. Fine him or do something else.''
Garnett did not speak to reporters after Tuesday's practice.
Both Anthony and Woodson said they had not been contacted by the league as of Tuesday afternoon. The N.B.A. was expected to make a ruling before the next Knicks game, on Thursday in Indiana.
In a similar situation earlier this season, the league suspended Sacramento's DeMarcus Cousins for two games for confronting Sean Elliott, the broadcast analyst for the San Antonio Spurs, after a game. In 2006, Anthony, then playing for the Denver Nuggets, was suspended for 15 games for punching the Knicks' Mardy Collins during a melee at Madison Square Garden.
Monday's confrontation between two of the league's elite players began early in the fourth quarter when Garnett was called for a foul on Anthony. Garnett yelled at the referees while Anthony barked at Garnett. A few possessions later, the two were each given technicals for shouting expletives and pushing each other near midcourt.
''Kevin is not going to back down or go anywhere,'' Rivers said of Garnett, who, at 36, is 8 years older than Anthony. ''Watch that tape. Kevin did nothing wrong throughout the game. He just played hard. He was defiant, stubborn on defense, didn't give you anything easy -- and that's how you're supposed to play defense. Sometimes it bothers people.''
Garnett clearly upset Anthony, who continued to curse Garnett on the court and bumped him numerous times after the whistle was blown. When the game ended, Anthony headed right into the tunnel that leads to the Celtics' locker room, rushing past his teammate Kurt Thomas, who tried to keep him on the court, and then past two security guards.
Anthony's focus on Garnett didn't help his performance. He went just 6 of 26 from the floor, an uncharacteristically poor shooting performance that contributed to the Knicks' loss. Woodson said he and Anthony talked Tuesday morning about how Anthony should have handled the situation better.
''He's been playing at a high level and he likes winning,'' Woodson said of Anthony. ''He just can't have slippage like that. This is strictly about the team. It's not about individuals. That's what I'm hammering home.''
Anthony's anger with Garnett on Monday night underlined a troubling pattern for both him and the Knicks this season. In four losses -- to Chicago, Memphis, Houston and the Celtics -- the Knicks have also lost their poise and have committed 12 technical fouls. Anthony alone has four of those technicals, a weak spot in what has otherwise been a superb season in which he has generated talk that he could end up as the league's most valuable player.
''I allowed some negativity to come into my circle,'' Anthony said of Monday's episode. ''But it's over with for me.''
That, of course, he will still have to prove.

Before Aurora Slaughter, Self-Portraits, Court Hears

BYLINE: By DAN FROSCH

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 13

LENGTH: 488 words

CENTENNIAL, Colo. -- The ghostly self portraits, taken with a cellphone hours before he opened fire at an Aurora movie theater, show James E. Holmes in the final sprint of his deadly plan, prosecutors believe. 
In one photo, his pupils lifeless from black contact lenses, Mr. Holmes sticks his tongue out, his dyed orange curls tumbling out of a knit cap. In another, his lips curl into a contorted grin, the muzzle end of a Glock pistol visible next to him. In a third, a large cache of weaponry and body armor is splayed neatly across a red sheet.
The photos were shown by prosecutors on Wednesday at the conclusion of a preliminary hearing held to determine whether there is enough evidence to move forward with a trial.
A former neuroscience graduate student at the University of Colorado Denver, Mr. Holmes is accused of killing 12 people and wounding more than 50 during a midnight showing of ''The Dark Knight Rises'' last July.
Judge William B. Sylvester of Arapahoe County District Court set a new hearing date for Friday and is expected to issue a ruling on the case by then. If he determines there is enough evidence to proceed, largely considered a formality, Mr. Holmes could be arraigned the same day.
Laying out their final pieces of evidence, prosecutors on Wednesday showed smartphone photos Mr. Holmes also took of the Century 16 movie theater in Aurora weeks before the shooting. He took the pictures while on an apparent reconnaissance mission, prosecutors say.
Other photographs, taken by the police, showed the parking lot behind the theater just hours after the shooting. An assault rifle lies on the ground near an emergency exit, a trail of blood snaking toward the door. A makeshift doorstop is jammed into the exit, propping it open. An array of tactical gear -- a gas mask, handguns, gun magazines and caltrops, sometimes used to puncture tires and the boots of infantrymen -- are scattered in and around Mr. Holmes's car.
''He picked the perfect venue for this crime,'' a prosecutor, Karen Pearson, told the court. ''There were never going to be enough ambulances, enough police officers to get everyone out of there fast enough.''
She added: ''He didn't care who he killed and how many he killed, because he wanted to kill all of them. And he knew what he was doing.''
Daniel King, a public defender for Mr. Holmes, did not call any witnesses during the two-and-a-half-day hearing, opting to wait before presenting his defense. Mr. King has signaled that he plans to argue Mr. Holmes is not guilty by reason of insanity.
''This is neither the proper venue nor the time for us to put on a show or present some truncated defense,'' he said.
After the cellphone photos of Mr. Holmes were displayed on two large television screens at the front of the courtroom, transfixing the packed gallery, Caren Teves, whose son Alex was killed that night, scribbled a note on a pad she held in her lap.
''No Insanity,'' it read.

Biden, Meeting Gun Control Advocates, Vows Action

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

SECTION: Section ; Column 0; Washington; Pg. 

LENGTH: 675 words

WASHINGTON -- President Obama is planning a comprehensive effort to pass legislation and use executive orders to prevent gun violence, representatives of about a dozen gun control organizations were told Wednesday at a White House meeting.
''The president and I are determined to take action. This is not an exercise in photo opportunities,'' Vice President Joseph R. Biden said as photographers were given a chance to take pictures before the closed-door meeting.
During the two-hour meeting, Mr. Biden and Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. vowed to move swiftly. 
''Clearly they are not talking about just having a conversation with the American people,'' said John Feinblatt, who attended the meeting on behalf of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, an outspoken advocate for greater gun control measures.
Mr. Feinblatt, a top aide to Mr. Bloomberg, said Mr. Biden promised both a ''legislative plan that could be achieved and a plan for executive actions.''
''Both those things are going to be pursued,'' he said.
The meeting was part of Mr. Biden's effort to develop proposals for Mr. Obama and Congress in the wake of the mass shooting in Newtown, Conn., last month. A panel led by Mr. Biden is scheduled to offer recommendations this month.
Offering a glimpse of the approach that he might take, Mr. Biden hinted that his group was not likely to recommend an all-or-nothing approach to the issue of gun violence.
''We are not going to get caught up in the notion unless we can do everything, we're not going to do anything,'' Mr. Biden said.
Among those at the White House were representatives of the Brady Campaign to End Gun Violence, Mayors Against Illegal Guns, States United to Prevent Gun Violence and several state gun control organizations.
''I want to hear about your experiences,'' Mr. Biden, sitting next to Mr. Holder, said to the group. ''I'm convinced that we can affect the well-being of millions of Americans and take thousands of people out of harm's way if we act responsibly.''
Mr. Feinblatt said the general consensus among the representatives of advocacy organizations at the meeting was to seek broad changes to law that could include an assault weapons ban, limits on high-capacity magazines for ammunition, better enforcement measures, a gun-trafficking statute and improved data for background checks.
He said the advocates also pushed for executive actions that would not require Congressional approval, including new efforts by the Justice Department to prosecute people who lie on their background checks.
Mr. Feinblatt said that some of the people in the meeting told personal stories of grief that reminded the others around the table that ''this is not some abstract exercise.''
Mr. Biden made it clear that doing nothing about gun violence was not an option under consideration. But he also said that his group would meet with gun owners and gun rights groups -- including the National Rifle Association -- that oppose significant new gun restrictions.
''I've also invited the gun owners and the N.R.A. to come and make their case as well,'' Mr. Biden said. ''We are reaching out to all parties on whatever side of this debate that you fall.''
He added: ''But the president is going to act. There is executive action that can be taken. We haven't decided what that is yet.''
In addition to the N.R.A., representatives from Walmart, whose stores are the largest seller of guns in the country, will also attend a meeting with the vice president on Thursday.
A spokesman for the company initially told The Wall Street Journal that Walmart would not be sending anyone to the meeting. But David Tovar, the vice president for corporate communications, reversed himself Wednesday morning.
''We underestimated the expectation to attend the meeting on Thursday in person, so we are sending an appropriate representative to participate,'' Mr. Tovar said in a statement. ''We take this issue very seriously and are committed to staying engaged in this discussion as the administration and Congress work toward a consensus on the right path forward.''

Reframing the Gun Debate

BYLINE: By CHARLES M. BLOW

SECTION: Section ; Column 0; OpEd; OP-ED COLUMNIST; Pg. 

LENGTH: 950 words

This time things are different.
This time, nearly a month after the horrible mass shooting in Newtown, Conn., the public attention hasn't ricocheted to the next story. On the contrary, sorrow has hardened into resolve.
This time, something can and must be done. And it looks as if something will.
The Washington Post reported Saturday that: 
''The White House is weighing a far broader and more comprehensive approach to curbing the nation's gun violence than simply reinstating an expired ban on assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition, according to multiple people involved in the administration's discussions.''
According to The Post's sources, this could include measures ''that would require universal background checks for firearm buyers, track the movement and sale of weapons through a national database, strengthen mental health checks, and stiffen penalties for carrying guns near schools or giving them to minors.''
And in addition to whatever legislative package the president may push, Vice President Joe Biden made clear Wednesday that the president wouldn't shy away from using executive action.
''The president is going to act,'' Biden said, according to CNN. ''Executive orders, executive action, can be taken.''
So, as we move into this season of change on gun policy, let's take a moment to better frame the debate.
First, let's fix some of the terminology: stop calling groups like the National Rifle Association a ''gun rights'' group. These are anti-regulation, pro-proliferation groups. They prey on public fears -- of the ''bad guys with guns,'' of a Second Amendment rollback, of an ever imminent apocalypse -- while helping gun makers line their pockets.
(Sturm, Ruger & Company's stock has gone up more than 500 percent since President Obama was first elected, and Smith & Wesson's stock is up more than 200 percent.)
And the gun makers return the favor. According to a 2011 report by the Violence Policy Center, a group advocating stronger gun regulations:
''Since 2005, corporations -- gun related and other -- have contributed between $19.8 million and $52.6 million to the NRA as detailed in its Ring of Freedom corporate giving program.''
The report continued:
''The vast majority of funds -- 74 percent -- contributed to the NRA from 'corporate partners' are members of the firearms industry: companies involved in the manufacture or sale of firearms or shooting-related products. Contributions to the NRA from the firearms industry since 2005 total between $14.7 million and $38.9 million.''
Groups like the N.R.A. aren't as much about rights as wrongs. The money being churned is soaked in blood and marked by madness.
Second, more reasonable people of good conscience and good faith, including responsible gun owners, need to talk openly, honestly and forcefully about the need for additional, reasonable regulations.
There is power in speaking up. We know the face of unfettered gun proliferation. Now it's time to see more faces of regulation and restraint.
Retired Gen. Stanley McChrystal joined those ranks on Tuesday when he said on MSNBC:
''I spent a career carrying typically either an M16, and later an M4 carbine. And an M4 carbine fires a .223 caliber round, which is 5.56 millimeters, at about 3,000 feet per second. When it hits a human body, the effects are devastating. It's designed to do that. And that's what our soldiers ought to carry. I personally don't think there's any need for that kind of weaponry on the street and particularly around the schools in America. I believe that we've got to take a serious look. I understand everybody's desire to have whatever they want, but we've got to protect our children, we've got to protect our police, we've got to protect our population. And I think we've got to take a very mature look at that.''
A ''mature look'' indeed. And that comes from a real soldier, not just someone who wants to feel like one.
Third, we must be clear that we are not talking about prohibition and confiscation but about de-escalation -- in both the volume and lethal efficiency -- and accountability.
No one is talking about forbidding law-abiding, mentally sound citizens to purchase nonmilitary-style weapons that don't hold more bullets than we have digits.
The point is to ensure that we don't sell military weapons with extended clips to the public and that the guns we do sell are purchased only by responsible people. And, once the guns are purchased, we need to ensure that they all remain in responsible hands. One place to start is to require background checks of all purchases and to track the guns, not just for the life of the purchaser, but for the life of the gun.
Last, we must understand that whatever we do now is not necessarily the whole of the solution but a step in the right direction on a long walk back from a precipice. Our search for solutions must be dynamic because the gun industry is wily and our quandary is epic.
We don't want to pass the point where society is so saturated with the most dangerous kinds of weaponry that people feel compelled to arm themselves or be left vulnerable, if indeed we haven't already passed that point.
According to The Associated Press, a small Utah town is making a ''gun in every home a priority.'' The A.P. reported:
''Spring City Councilman Neil Sorensen first proposed an ordinance requiring a gun in every household in the town of 1,000. The rest of the council scoffed at making it a requirement, but they unanimously agreed to move forward with an ordinance 'recommending' the idea. The council also approved funding to offer concealed firearms training Friday to the 20 teachers and administrators at the local elementary school.''
That is not where we want to be as a country.

South Africa: Unrest in the Vineyards

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; WORLD BRIEFING | AFRICA; Pg. 8

LENGTH: 124 words

South African police fired rubber bullets at striking farmworkers who set up barricades and threw stones on Wednesday in a province whose vineyards are vital to the wine industry. At least 50 demonstrators were arrested, the authorities said. Labor unrest has spread across various sectors of the economy in the past year, from mining to trucking, underscoring the growing frustration with vast inequalities in wealth and the slow pace of economic progress for millions of poor people. Some protests turned violent, culminating in the shooting deaths of several dozen miners by the police at a platinum mine. The protests among farmworkers took place in several areas of Western Cape Province, where similar protests last year also turned violent.

In Hartford, A Promise To Tighten Gun Laws

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 19

LENGTH: 751 words

HARTFORD -- Choking up as he reflected on the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, in a somber State of the State address beginning the legislative session at the State Capitol here, promised to take actions aimed at preventing a similar tragedy from happening again.
With officials from Newtown in attendance, Mr. Malloy, a Democrat, said the state would pursue gun control, school safety and mental health measures in response to the Dec. 14 shooting, which left 20 children and 6 educators dead. He did not unveil specific proposals, but members of both parties said after his speech that they expected to have the first parts of bipartisan gun control legislation ready to be approved by the end of February. 
''When it comes to preventing future acts of violence in our schools, let me say this: more guns are not the answer,'' Mr. Malloy said in his third State of the State address since being elected in 2010. ''Freedom is not a handgun on the hip of every teacher, and security should not mean a guard posted outside every classroom. That is not who we are in Connecticut, and it is not who we will allow ourselves to become.''
Unlike New York, where Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo in his State of the State address on Wednesday proposed one of the nation's most sweeping bans on assault weapons, Mr. Malloy did not include specific gun control measures in his remarks.
The state's legislative leadership met on Wednesday to begin researching gun-control legislation. A commission announced by Mr. Malloy last week will look at both guns and the broader issues, particularly mental health care, raised by the assault.
Despite pressing issues like a $1.2 billion budget deficit and damage from Hurricane Sandy, the aftermath of the Newtown shootings dominated the day, from the governor's remarks to the green-and-white ribbons worn by legislators to the applause for Newtown's first selectwoman, E. Patricia Llodra, and superintendent of schools, Janet Robinson, who sat beside Mr. Malloy's wife, Cathy.
''It won't surprise you that this speech is very different from the one I first envisioned giving,'' Mr. Malloy said. ''In the early days of December, I began thinking about what I'd like to say. Now, while it's only been a few short weeks on the calendar, we have all walked a very long and very dark road together.''
He paid tribute to the heroism and sacrifice in Newtown and added: ''But we also must ask ourselves: What is our responsibility? To those we've lost, to one another, to our children, and to future generations?''
In the past, despite Democratic control of both houses of the General Assembly, some gun control measures have hit roadblocks after firearms manufacturers based in the state said that jobs could be at stake. Connecticut, home to the Colt Manufacturing Company, remains the seventh-largest producer of firearms in the country, according to federal data.
Still, Democratic and Republican leaders said they expected to be able to pass new legislation.
''I think we're going to see a lot more common ground than you would expect,'' said the House minority leader, Lawrence F. Cafero Jr.
A starting point is likely to be the discrepancy in Connecticut gun laws that makes permit regulations much tougher for handguns than for long guns, including assault rifles. Other issues in consideration are likely to include limits on high-capacity magazines and expanding the current assault weapons ban to cover the semiautomatic weapon used in the Sandy Hook shooting, which had been legally bought by the mother of the gunman, Adam Lanza.
But J. Brendan Sharkey, the new speaker of the House, said it was essential to go beyond ''knee-jerk'' legislation that could be full of loopholes and flaws.
''The people of Connecticut expect us to move quickly, but they also expect us to move smartly,'' he said.
Overshadowed by the Sandy Hook issues was a gaping budget hole that otherwise would have been the focus of the General Assembly's opening day. Mr. Cafero said Mr. Malloy seemed to be rewriting history when he said he saw fiscal progress that Mr. Cafero said did not exist. But he, like others, said one response to the Newtown shootings should be a commitment to civility and bipartisanship in the Legislature, and he gave Mr. Malloy credit for his handling of the shootings.
''We as citizens owe him a debt of gratitude for the way he led us through Sandy Hook, and you could tell it has obviously affected him deeply,'' he said. ''God bless him for it.''

Cuomo and Legislative Leaders Say They're Close to Deal on New Gun Laws

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN and DANNY HAKIM

SECTION: Section ; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 

LENGTH: 784 words

ALBANY -- Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and legislative leaders believe they are close to an agreement on a package of gun laws that includes a restrictive ban on assault weapons, and lawmakers hope to vote on it as soon as next week.
Mr. Cuomo, delivering his third annual State of the State address on Wednesday, called on lawmakers to approve the toughest assault weapons ban in the nation. And, displaying an unsual degree of speed for Albany, lawmakers seemed prepared to move quickly on the governor's request. 
''Forget the extremists -- it's simple,'' Mr. Cuomo said to a crescendo of applause near the end of his nearly-80-minute speech. ''No one hunts with an assault rifle. No one needs 10 bullets to kill a deer. End the madness now.''
Mr. Cuomo not only proposed a far more restrictive assault weapons ban than currently exists in New York, but he also proposed a more comprehensive ban on large-capacity magazines. He also proposed to require background checks for private sales of guns, not just at gun shows and stores. And he called for tougher penalties for buying guns illegally or for using them to commit crimes, as well as for uniform licensing standards across the state.
''This is not taking away people's guns,'' he said. ''That is not what this is about. It is about ending the unnecessary risk of high-capacity assault rifles.''
Mr. Cuomo has been working feverishly to negotiate a deal with lawmakers, and he is said to be close to one that would allow for rapid passage of the gun measures.
Indeed, the Senate Republican leader, Dean G. Skelos of Long Island, said on Wednesday that Republicans were having productive negotiations with Mr. Cuomo. ''I think our goal is to try to get something done by the end of this week, present it to conference next week, and we'll see where we go,'' he said.
Mr. Cuomo, rewriting his agenda after the trauma of the Newtown, Conn., school massacre and the devastation of Hurricane Sandy, proposed a number of measures intended to limit the damage from future storms, in addition to steps intended to reduce the scourge of gun violence.
The governor, a Democrat who has come under attack from the liberal wing of his party as he contemplates a 2016 bid for the presidency, also tacked aggressively to the left with new proposals in his address, delivered in an auditorium at the Capitol complex. He proposed an increase of the state minimum wage to $8.75 an hour from $7.25 an hour, tougher greenhouse gas standards, solar jobs programs, a $1 billion affordable-housing initiative, grants for schools that extend school days and a 10-point plan for women that included strengthening abortion rights laws and enacting equal-pay legislation that garnered the loudest applause.
Mr. Cuomo did not say how his many proposals would be financed; he is to introduce his budget later this month.
The governor said he would continue to push for a referendum in November on expanding casino gambling, and described casinos as vehicles for improving the upstate economy. He said that, at first, he would allow as many as three full-scale casinos upstate, and none in New York City, in an effort to lure tourists to travel upstate.
But guns and the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy were focal points of his address. In New York, the debate resulting from the Newtown school bloodshed was amplified by the shooting deaths of two firefighters in Webster, N.Y.; Mr. Cuomo gave flags to the families of the firefighters, and the police chief from Rochester, which is near Webster, called on New York to lead the nation on gun control.
Speaking of Hurricane Sandy, the governor drew from the early progress of four commissions he created in the wake of the storm, though many of their proposals are still works in progress.
''Climate change is real,'' he said. ''It is denial to say each of these situations is a once-in-a-lifetime. There is a 100-year flood every two years now. It is inarguable that the sea is warmer and there is changing weather pattern, and the time to act is now.''
Among his proposals was a bailout fund for homeowners who want to move out of flood-prone regions, and aid to build homes to better withstand floods. He also called for measures to better protect subways, public utilities, the fuel delivery system and the New York Harbor.
And he excoriated Washington for waiting so long to provide New York and New Jersey with federal storm aid.
''That is just too little and it is too late, and it has nothing to do with the way Congress has acted in the past,'' he said. ''This has long been established that in the face of a disaster, the national government comes in to help.''
''Remember New York,'' he added, ''because New York will not forget, I promise you.''

Cuomo Calls for the State to Return to Its Progressive Ideals

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 18

LENGTH: 942 words

ALBANY -- Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who spent his first two years in office establishing himself as a fiscal conservative, turned left in his third annual address to the Legislature, and sought to reclaim the state's progressive mantle.
Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, had two emotional fulcrums in his sprawling 78-minute address: gun violence and Hurricane Sandy. But most of the speech was devoted to an onslaught of proposals favored by the left wing of his party. 
He proposed increasing the minimum wage to $8.75 an hour from $7.25 an hour, public financing of elections, tougher greenhouse gas standards, solar jobs programs, a $1 billion affordable housing initiative, grants for schools that extend school days and a 10-point women's rights program that garnered loud applause for its provisions strengthening abortion rights laws and enacting equal pay legislation.
''We are a community based on progressive principles,'' the governor said, in a speech to several hundred lawmakers and guests at an auditorium in the Capitol complex. ''We must remain that progressive capital of the nation.''
How the state would pay for any new programs was not clear. The governor is to introduce his budget this month, but until Congress decides how much aid to send to New York to defray the costs of rebuilding after Hurricane Sandy, the state's financial picture will be clouded.
The governor promised not to raise taxes. He has made similar promises in the past, but then agreed to support a new higher tax bracket for the state's highest earners. And he said he would continue to push for a referendum in November allowing an expansion of casino gambling, describing casinos as vehicles for improving the upstate economy. He said that, at first, he would allow as many as three full-scale casinos upstate, and none in New York City, in an effort to lure tourists to travel to economically struggling areas.
Overall, the speech served to reposition the governor, who has faced criticism from the left wing of his party for paying too little attention to their concerns. Liberals praised the governor in 2011 for persuading lawmakers to pass same-sex marriage legislation. But his first two years in office focused on a centrist fiscal policy that included a cap on property tax increases, steep spending cuts and contentious negotiations with unions that resulted in a cut to the pension benefits of future state employees.
Now Mr. Cuomo, who is considered, at least in New York, a presidential contender for 2016, is emphasizing proposals -- some new and some he has suggested in the past -- that cheer his Democratic base. Progressive proposals by Mr. Cuomo are also likely to face a more receptive audience in the Legislature this year because the Senate, which had been controlled by Republicans, is now controlled by a coalition that includes several Democrats, as well as all of the Republicans. The Assembly is controlled by Democrats.
Few advocacy groups on the left found issues they could not applaud. Environmental Advocates of New York said Mr. Cuomo ''showed true leadership'' in his comments on climate change. Andrea Miller, president of Naral Pro-Choice New York, said of his proposed women's initiatives, ''He heard the call and is a true leader.''
Bob Master, director of legislative action at the Communications Workers of America, said, ''To the extent he's using this speech to appeal to the liberal primary electorate, doing something meaningful on public financing would be a big achievement.''
Republicans also saw the trend, but bemoaned it. Assemblyman Steve Katz, a Hudson Valley Republican, called the speech ''a sharp veer to the left offering big government solutions for all problems.''
Even the cover of a 300-page book that accompanied the speech was something of a kitchen sink -- an odd tableau that superimposed a stark image of Breezy Point, the Queens neighborhood devastated by Hurricane Sandy, on the front lawn of the Capitol building, with a new model of the Tappan Zee Bridge soaring overhead.
The governor gave some of his most impassioned remarks to date on guns, a cause he has voiced support for in the past but has not made a legislative priority. Mr. Cuomo's legislative agenda was clearly upended by the recent mass shooting in Newtown, Conn., and the killings of two firefighters in Webster, N.Y. ''End the madness now,'' he said Wednesday.
''Forget the extremists -- it's simple,'' the governor added, to a burst of applause. ''No one hunts with an assault rifle. No one needs 10 bullets to kill a deer.''
The governor also continued to use Hurricane Sandy as a reason to talk about global warming.
''Climate change is real,'' he said. ''It is denial to say each of these situations is a once-in-a-lifetime. There is a 100-year flood every two years now. It is inarguable that the sea is warmer and there is a changing weather pattern, and the time to act is now.''
Among his proposals were a bailout fund for homeowners who want to move out of flood-prone regions, and aid for building homes that can withstand floods -- ideas that are contingent on how much federal aid comes through. He also called for measures to better protect subways, public utilities, the fuel delivery system and New York Harbor.
And he excoriated Washington for waiting so long to provide New York and New Jersey with federal storm aid.
''That is just too little and it is too late, and it has nothing to do with the way Congress has acted in the past,'' he said. ''This has long been established, that in the face of a disaster, the national government comes in to help.''
''Remember New York,'' he added, ''because New York will not forget, I promise you.''

Iranian Captives Freed in Syrian Prisoner Exchange

BYLINE: By ANNE BARNARD and SEBNEM ARSU; Anne Barnard reported from Beirut and Sebnem Arsu from Istanbul. Reporting was contributed by Hwaida Saad and Hania Mourtada from Beirut, Thomas Erdbrink from Tehran, Alan Cowell from London, and Rick Gladstone from New York.

BEIRUT, Lebanon -- More than 2,100 people incarcerated by the Syrian authorities were being released on Wednesday in return for 48 Iranians freed by rebels after five months in captivity, Turkish and Iranian officials said, in what appeared to be the biggest prisoner swap since the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad of Syria began almost two years ago.
The timing of the exchange, brokered by Turkey and Qatar, was notable, suggesting that negotiations over at least some aspects of the Syrian crisis had not been abandoned three days after Mr. Assad warned that he would not negotiate with his armed adversaries and dismissed calls for him to quit.
Word of the exchange came as allies of Mr. Assad and of his opponents announced that they would continue talking, at least to one another. Lakhdar Brahimi, the special Syria envoy from the United Nations and the Arab League, will meet in Geneva on Friday with senior diplomats from Russia, which has opposed efforts to unseat Mr. Assad forcibly, and the United States, which, like Turkey, supports the armed opposition and wants Mr. Assad out. 
While Mr. Assad's unbending stance seemed to make a political solution to Syria's civil war more remote, his only major foreign allies, Russia and Iran, have their eye on maintaining regional influence in a possible post-Assad future, and an interest in ending the Syrian war with state institutions intact. They have made clear they still favor a settlement. Backers of the opposition, too, worry about chaos in Syria and the region as the fight drags on, and the prisoner exchange suggested that Turkey and Iran, at least, wanted to maintain good relations even as they find themselves on opposite sides of the Syrian conflict.
The prisoner exchange was an enormous relief for Iran, which had long contended the 48 hostages were innocent civilians seized on a religious pilgrimage -- not pro-Assad paramilitary fighters, as asserted by their rebel captors.
The exchange was announced as Mr. Brahimi, a veteran Algerian diplomat, made his strongest suggestion yet that he would try to pressure Mr. Assad to step aside. Mr. Brahimi's comments, in interviews with the BBC and Reuters, were his first since Mr. Assad, in a rare public address on Sunday, appeared to reject Mr. Brahimi's mediation efforts as foreign interference.
''In Syria, in particular, I think that what people are saying is that a family ruling for 40 years is a little bit too long,'' Mr. Brahimi told the BBC. Reuters quoted him as saying that Mr. Assad would surely not be a member of any transitional government, envisioned in a peace plan that major powers, including Russia and the United States, had drafted last year in Geneva.
There were other signs that opposing nations were seeking to bridge differences on Syria. Iran's foreign minister is scheduled to hold talks on Syria on Thursday with President Mohamed Morsi of Egypt, who has made Mr. Assad's removal his central foreign policy goal. A spokesman for Iran's Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday that even countries that disagree on Syria realize its crisis has no military solution, and should talk more to bring their views closer. And a Turkish deputy foreign minister arrived on Wednesday in Moscow for high-level talks on the crisis, the Turkish news media reported.
Some Middle East political experts speculated that the timing of the prisoner exchange -- and the lopsided ratio of roughly 44 people released by Syria for every freed Iranian hostage -- reflected both Mr. Assad's increasing dependence on Iran as well as Iran's increased pressure on him, possibly out of fear that Syria's instability may worsen.
''I'm wondering if this is the beginning of Iran starting to cut its losses, pulling out these folks, reducing its presence in the country,'' said Mona Yacoubian, a senior adviser on the Middle East at the Stimson Center, a Washington research group.
But some members of the Syrian opposition said the prisoner exchange merely showed that Mr. Assad showed more concern for Tehran than for his own soldiers, far more of whom are being held in captivity by rebels.
''If only we had half a million Iranians,'' Adeeb Shishakly, an exile opposition member said on Facebook, ''we would have released them for the freedom of 23 million Syrians.''
Iran's Foreign Ministry issued a statement thanking Turkey and Qatar for helping to secure the release of the Iranian hostages. Iran state television showed a brief clip of them at the Sheraton Hotel in Damascus, grinning, flashing victory signs and holding flowers.
The Iranians were seized in August while traveling to a Shiite shrine near Damascus. Opposition fighters had threatened to kill them unless Mr. Assad's forces stopped shooting. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey said he hoped the exchange would lead to freedom for more prisoners in Syria -- and emphasized, ''This process needs to be appreciated.''
The exchange emerged from months of behind-the-scenes negotiations involving a Turkish charitable group, the Humanitarian Relief Foundation, widely known as I.H.H. The group had set up an operation center in Damascus to unite 2,130 prisoners, including 73 women, at one base while another aid team remained in Douma, near the Syrian capital, to oversee the return of the 48 Iranians.
Precise details remained unclear. There were no pictures or lists released of the Syrian prisoners, or official confirmation from the Syrian government.
But Syrian fighters and activists reported that prisoners had been freed, including the ''brides of freedom,'' Rima Dali and three others arrested in a Damascus market while wearing wedding dresses and carrying signs condemning bloodshed. The aid group said the prisoners included four Turks and a Palestinian, and its director, Bulent Yildirim, described prisoners at the Damascus exchange he coordinated.
''Captivity is a hard thing,'' he said. ''I saw young women crying, many people lost a lot of weight, and there were also many sick people.''
The Turkish aid group gained international attention in 2010 for organizing a flotilla of boats heading to Gaza, ostensibly with relief supplies, that prompted a deadly Israeli commando raid in which eight Turks and an American of Turkish descent died. Recently, the organization has also negotiated to free smaller numbers of prisoners, including two Turkish journalists held in Syria, Reuters reported, and delivered aid to Syrians.
Some rebel commanders said more modest prisoner exchanges had become a feature of the conflict.
The leader of a rebel fighting group in the central city of Hama, reached via Skype, said pro-government militia members had captured his uncle and two other relatives in a village in the northern Idlib Province last month.
''The only way to release them is capturing hostages,'' the commander said. He said talks were under way to release his relatives in return for 12 captives held by rebels. Two months ago, he added, nine members of a pro-government militia, known as shabiha, were exchanged for five captured rebels.

Atop Senate, Odd Couple With Issues

ALBANY -- As Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo talked state of the state on Tuesday, the alternating presidents pro tem of the New York State Senate sat on the dais listening -- two men who could not hide their I-swallowed-the-canary smiles.
State Senators Jeffrey D. Klein and Dean G. Skelos, the putative liberal Democrat and the putative conservative Republican, kept confiding and giggling at each other's jokes. 
They have made one of Albany's stranger marriages, the five-member Independent Democratic Conference joining the Republican majority in a political alliance, with the remainder of the Democrats cast into the wilderness.
The governor vowed to defend women and abortion choice, and Mr. Klein clapped. The Republican senator tried to sit on his hands. The governor talked of guns; the Republican looked stern. The Democrat applauded.
Ambition is its own aphrodisiac, but the strains on these political newlyweds are obvious to the eye. Earlier Wednesday, to sit in the gallery in the 23-karat gold-leaf-covered Senate chambers was to listen to the winning coalition more or less make up the arrangements.
Mr. Klein and Mr. Skelos will serve as pro tem on alternating days during January, March and June, and every two weeks the rest of the year. The deputy Republican leader, Thomas W. Libous, offered reassurance: ''At no time should either one of the coalition leaders, Senator Skelos or Senator Klein, serve contemporaneously as temporary president.''
That forestalls the rip in the space/time continuum problem.
The Republicans retain the upper hand, appointing the key institutional officers. Mr. Klein's rump faction will get some committee chairs and, one imagines, a lode of lulus, Albany speak for the legislative bonuses and handsome office suites.
Mr. Klein, already a formidable fund-raiser, stands to become a soft-money potentate. The Democratic Party and its remaining adherents fare more poorly. Fifty-eight percent of the electorate voted for Democratic State Senate candidates in the past election, but the party faces another two years in minority status, and it will receive just 29 percent of the tens of millions of dollars set aside for members' items.
''Does much about this make sense?'' asks Susan Lerner of Common Cause, and then provides the answer: ''No.''
In his speech on the Senate floor, Mr. Klein sounded not so much like a man newly married to a conservative Republican. He spoke of decriminalizing marijuana, increasing the minimum wage and making it easier for immigrant children who lack legal documentation to go to college.
His putative Republican partners gave Mr. Klein a stony police lineup stare during his peroration. But you might assume that a deal -- less politely the fix -- is done. The Republicans face an implacable demographic problem -- they are conservative and more rural than not in a state that is growing more liberal and urban and suburban every day. Gerrymandering barely protected the state senators this year.
Artful compromise could safeguard a Republican Party moving slowly into the minority. As Mr. Libous, the Republican Senate's resident transactional realist, put it: ''Hey, you can compromise anything, y'know.''
Behind much of this stands the governor. He signaled that Republican, Democrat, Republicrat, he could play with any Senate iteration that plays with him. A cynic might venture the governor gets a minimum wage, but not too much, and a Dream Act without perhaps the money to fully fund it. And he gets to say that Republicans voted for gun control, and perhaps for decriminalization of marijuana.
Senator Liz Krueger, a liberal Democrat, has waged a battle for transparent rules in the Senate for years, which is not unlike passing your life trying to conjure blood from a stone.
Just before the new coalition shoved through its rules without discussion, she asked about a secret agreement between Senators Skelos and Klein, laying out the benefits of their marriage.
Is this so?
Senator Kemp Hannon, a Republican, sighed wearily. ''I understand those discussions have taken place,'' he said. ''Sometimes they may or may not have reduced it to paper, but I don't think it's ever been final.''
He shrugged. And that was that.

Big Teachers' Fund to Sell Its Gun Shares

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH and MICHAEL COOPER; Julie Creswell contributed reporting.

SECTION: Section B; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 3

LENGTH: 1019 words

One of America's largest pension funds began on Wednesday to divest itself of firearms holdings, a response to the schoolhouse shooting in Newtown, Conn., that other pension funds could follow.
The California State Teachers Retirement System, known as Calstrs, voted unanimously to begin its formal divestment process. The vote occurred at a public meeting where teachers said they did not want their retirement nest eggs placed with companies like the Freedom Group, the maker of the Bushmaster semiautomatic rifle that authorities say Adam Lanza used to kill 20 first graders and six adults at the Sandy Hook elementary school on Dec. 14.
''This latest incident, which occurred at a school and involved fellow educators and the children we cherish, is a tipping point for Calstrs,'' said Harry Keiley, chairman of the fund's investment committee. 
Divestment involves several steps, to make sure fund officials comply with their fiduciary duty to protect the assets being accumulated for teachers and retirees. It took Calstrs several years to divest its tobacco holdings. Mr. Keiley predicted the firearms industry would come under market pressure that could make it an unsound investment.
The move puts the California teachers' fund at the forefront of a movement to reconsider whether investing in firearms is an appropriate way for states and cities to cover the retirement costs of their workers. Since the shootings, officials of other public pension funds, including those in New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts, have said they were searching their portfolios for firearms investments. But some of them have also expressed concerns about their fiduciary duties.
''We can't manage the pension fund based on whatever the hot issue of the moment is,'' said Thomas P. DiNapoli, the sole trustee of New York State's pension fund for state and municipal workers in a radio interview.
He said he had found weapons holdings worth about $15 million, out of a $150 billion portfolio and was still deliberating over what steps to take. ''There are big questions about gun manufacturers, and where we're headed as a society,'' he told WNYC.
In addition to the Freedom Group, the California teachers' pension fund has investments in two other gun companies, Smith & Wesson and Sturm, Ruger, according to the fund's chief investment officer, Chris Ailman. The amounts are small, about $12 million, out of a total portfolio of about $154 billion. But all three companies make guns that private citizens are not allowed to own in California, according to Mr. Ailman, who was asked to provide detailed information on firearms investments to the pension fund's trustees.
The stocks of publicly traded weapons companies can swing sharply in response to news events. They fell after the Newtown shootings, leaving investors with losses and an uncertain outlook. Many pension investments in gun companies have been made through private equity partnerships, which usually run for many years and are hard to leave early without taking a loss.
Officials of several pension funds with stakes in the Freedom Group said that in keeping with the usual practice in private equities, they were not told in advance that their money would finance a firearms business.
The private equity company that owns the Freedom Group, Cerberus Capital Management, has already said it would sell the gun business and return to investors the money they had put into it. Cerberus said this would protect the investors' financial interests while keeping them out of the gun-control debate, which it said in December was ''more properly pursued by those with the formal charter and public responsibility to do so.'' It added, ''That is the job of our federal and state legislators.''
But one trustee of the teachers' fund, California Treasurer Bill Lockyer, said state laws and the fund's own investment rules necessitated a formal divestiture. He made the motion to design and execute a plan to divest of all companies that make guns that are illegal in California. When he was state attorney general from 1998 to 2006 he clashed with the National Rifle Association over the enforcement of California's gun laws, which are widely seen as the most strict of any state.
The state teachers' fund also requires its investment analysts to consider if a company makes a product so detrimental to human health ''that it draws significant product liability lawsuits'' and ''avoidance by other institutional investors.'' The rule was added in 2008, when the fund was divesting of tobacco interests. Mr. Lockyer said it was applicable to makers of large-capacity ammunition clips and assault weapons, which ''pose extreme dangers to public health and safety.''
Mr. Lockyer also sits on the board of Calpers, California's pension fund for state and municipal workers. He is expected to make a similar motion when that $243 billion fund holds an investment meeting next week.
An official of the Los Angeles pension fund for police and fire fighters said one of its trustees had also sought an evaluation of how its investment in the Freedom Group comported with its investment policies. The Los Angeles Police Department is also a customer of the company.
Connecticut's treasurer, Denise L. Nappier, who is the sole trustee of that state's pension fund, said the fund's only stake in a weapons manufacturer was in Alliant Techsystems, which sells ammunition. But she said she was also looking for potential problems among companies that sell and distribute weapons.
New York City's five pension funds -- which were valued at $127.8 billion in September -- contain nearly $18 million in weapons and ammunition companies, the city comptroller's office said. The comptroller, John C. Liu, said in a statement that the funds ''are reviewing their holdings in gun manufacturers and are considering all options, including divestment, to ensure that public pension dollars do not support weapons that can destroy a community in the blink of an eye.''
But other public pension funds, including those in Idaho and Texas, said they did not consider the investments an issue.

A Slimming Wall Street Giant

BYLINE: By SUSANNE CRAIG

LENGTH: 1383 words

When Morgan Stanley's top executives gathered in mid-September at the Gramercy Park Hotel in Manhattan to discuss strategy, some participants complained that the room was too small.
Apparently, that was the point: James P. Gorman, Morgan Stanley's chief executive, chose the cramped quarters to force discussion among the executives, said people briefed on his decision but not authorized to speak on the record.
These days, it is the Wall Street firm that is finding itself a bit boxed in.
Regulatory demands, weak markets and lower credit ratings have weighed on all banks, but perhaps more so on Morgan Stanley, the smallest of the big Wall Street firms. In the three years that Mr. Gorman, 54, has been at the helm, the bank has been progressively shrinking its business of trading bonds, commodities and other investments and expanding into wealth management. 
Now the storied company - whose take-no-prisoners trading desks have at times been rivaled only by firms like Goldman Sachs - is cutting even deeper, raising questions among some on Wall Street about whether it should spin off or ditch much of its trading business as its Swiss rival UBS has, a suggestion the firm eschews.
Morgan Stanley is planning another deep round of cuts: 1,600 jobs, accounting for 6 percent of its support work force, and, more telling, 6 percent of institutional securities, which includes its once vaunted trading business.
The planned cuts come just a week ahead of the release of fourth-quarter earnings, which are expected to show the gains the firm has made since the financial crisis in areas like stock trading, banking and wealth management but still will be weighed down by the diminished earnings power of its fixed income business.
Whether the company can avoid shrinking further - and a number of analysts say that additional cuts will be needed - and revive the fixed-income trading business will have significant ripple effects in the financial world.
While the strategy of cutting in some places and building out wealth management may lead to a more stable company, the retreat also means that the fixed-income trading business over all is becoming increasingly dominated by two Wall Street banks - JPMorgan Chase and Goldman - as well as by hedge funds and other investment firms that are more lightly regulated than banks like Morgan Stanley.
Before the financial crisis, the fixed income division at Morgan Stanley, which was created by J. P. Morgan partners when Depression-era laws forced them to split banking from trading, was one of the firm's biggest moneymakers. Now, it is a drain on operations, producing just 20 percent of its revenue but tying up roughly half of its capital.
In recent years, the fixed-income department has not been able to make enough money to cover the cost to Morgan Stanley of this capital, according to people briefed on the matter but not authorized to speak on the record.
The fallout can be seen in compensation: a year ago, 110 of the roughly 500 managing directors in sales and trading did not get a bonus, and that number is expected to grow next week when bonuses are handed out.
Still, Mr. Gorman has received high marks from some on Wall Street for playing a difficult hand in the wake of the financial crisis. On Wednesday, he received a big vote of confidence when Daniel S. Loeb's hedge fund told investors that it was taking a stake, saying that Morgan Stanley was "in the early innings of a turnaround."
Still, hobbled by the new realities on Wall Street, that turnaround has so far proved to be a Sisyphean task.
The stock, said the shareholder Christopher Grisanti, has "languished." Mr. Grisanti is the owner and co-founder of Grisanti Capital Management, which owns 690,000 shares of Morgan Stanley, valued at $13.5 million.
While the stock has risen since Mr. Grisanti bought it, it is down almost 40 percent since Mr. Gorman took over in January 2010, and big shareholders like the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ of Japan, which holds a 22 percent stake valued at $8.5 billion, have had little in the way of returns. Morgan Stanley's return on equity, Wall Street's main benchmark of profitability, is 6 percent, down from 23.8 percent in 2006.
Morgan Stanley's board, said people briefed on the matter, has discussed closing its fixed-income department. Instead, the firm is shrinking the unit, arguing that it is important to offer its customers those trading services. By cutting jobs and costs and exiting lines like structured products and other complex financial investments and focusing on less risky, less capital-intensive businesses like the trading of interest rates, executives contended that the division can generate a healthy return.
"We are not going to pull a UBS," the senior executive Colm Kelleher told a private dinner of Morgan Stanley shareholders at Oceana restaurant in Midtown Manhattan.
A Morgan Stanley spokesman, Wesley McDade, said the firm was optimistic about its prospects.
"In 2013, we expect to benefit from the many strategic decisions we have taken, including an aggressive move into wealth management, a further strengthening of our pre-eminent equities and investment banking franchises, and the repositioning of our fixed income business to meet the realities of the new world," he said.
Morgan Stanley wants to achieve a return on equity of 10 percent in the near term, and it is making progress as it continues to shed both employees and risky assets. Longer term, Morgan Stanley is shooting for a return on equity in the middle teens, according to people briefed on the matter but not authorized to speak on the record.
Critics said Morgan Stanley executives initially moved too slowly to cut business lines, and set unrealistic revenue goals for the division that were never met.
Recently, Mr. Gorman tapped one of his bankers, John Pruzan, to be his eyes and ears in meetings about the revamping of the department. Even that move was not without controversy, though. Some executives in that department, including the fixed income chief Kenneth deRegt, felt it added an unnecessary layer of management.
At the same time, while trying to squeeze risk out, it has taken some surprising ones, hiring for instance a powerful and controversial trader to run its rates desk, a primary center of growth for the fixed-income department. That trader, Glenn Hadden, is under investigation by a key regulator for his trading in Treasury futures. In 2009, he was put on leave at Goldman because of a separate trading incident.
Through Mr. McDade, the Morgan Stanley spokesman, Mr. Hadden declined to comment. A lawyer for Mr. Hadden also declined to comment, but has said that his client did not engage in manipulative activity.
The firm Mr. Gorman runs bears little resemblance to the one that existed before the financial crisis. Mr. Gorman's predecessor, John J. Mack, pushed risk-taking, leading to a $9 billion loss in 2007, one of the largest single trading losses in history, as well as billions of dollars in additional losses because of exposure to bond insurers.
These events nearly crippled the firm, and Morgan Stanley was forced to sell a piece of itself to Mitsubishi, which injected $9 billion into the firm. Not long after, in January 2009, Morgan Stanley made another important strategic investment, combining its wealth management operations with Citigroup in a joint venture that gave Morgan Stanley control.
Still, just weeks after taking over as chief, Mr. Gorman took the stage at a Hilton in Midtown Manhattan on a cold winter day to assure a standing-room-only crowd of investors that maintaining the firm's position as one of Wall Street's most powerful investment banks was a top priority for him.
Even in early 2010, however, it was clear to many inside the firm that he would have his work cut out for him.
Every Wednesday, executives from various corners of the bank who belonged to what was known as the asset liability committee would meet at noon to examine the cost to the firm of everything from looming credit-rating downgrades to regulatory changes.
"It was the most depressing meeting ever," said one attendee who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "It was very clear the Morgan Stanley we knew was never coming back."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

New York Nears Law Tightening Limits on Guns

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER and THOMAS KAPLAN; Michael Cooper and Michael D. Shear contributed reporting.

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 1120 words

New York State is nearing agreement on a proposal to put what would be some of the nation's strictest gun-control laws into effect, including what Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo vowed on Wednesday would be an ironclad ban on assault weapons and large-capacity magazines, and new measures to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and mentally ill people.
Lawmakers in Albany, seeking to send a message to the nation that the recent mass shootings demand swift action, say they hope to vote on the package of legislation as soon as next week.
The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, told reporters on Wednesday that Mr. Cuomo and legislative leaders were ''95 percent'' of the way toward an agreement. Senate Republicans, considered the only possible obstacle to the governor's proposal, indicated they did not intend to block a deal. 
''When you hear about these issues all across the nation, whether it's in the movie theater in Aurora, Colo., or Columbine, something needs to happen -- something transformative,'' said Senator Timothy M. Kennedy, a Democrat from Buffalo.
The dash to enact new gun controls made New York the first flash point in the battles over firearm restrictions that are expected to consume several state capitals this year.
But the debate also raged elsewhere on Wednesday, from Denver, where supporters of gun rights rallied to oppose weapon restrictions in the new legislative session, to Connecticut, whose governor, Dannel P. Malloy, in an emotional speech to lawmakers -- he lost his composure talking about the mass killings at a Newtown elementary school last month -- said, ''More guns are not the answer.''
At the White House, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. met with gun-control advocates and said the Obama administration planned both to pass legislation and to use executive orders to try to reduce gun violence. ''The president and I are determined to take action,'' Mr. Biden said. ''This is not an exercise in photo opportunities.''
Mr. Cuomo's aides said the proposed legislation in New York would expand the definition of what is considered an assault weapon to match California's law, currently the most restrictive in the nation. But the overall package would go further, they said, by limiting detachable ammunition magazines to 7 rounds from the current 10, and requiring background checks for purchases of ammunition, not just weapons.
Limiting magazines to seven rounds would give New York the toughest restrictions in the nation. Only around half a dozen states currently limit the size of magazines, and most of them allow magazines that contain up to 10 rounds, according to a survey by the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which advocates gun control. The New York law would also close a loophole that has thwarted enforcement of limits on the size of magazines.
Even as Mr. Cuomo detailed his plans, gun-rights groups mobilized to oppose the new restrictions.
''We fully expect that New York state's gun owners will be completely engaged in this debate and N.R.A. will be there to lead them,'' said Chris W. Cox, the chief lobbyist for the National Rifle Association, which has donated more money to state politicians in New York than anywhere else, much of it to Senate Republicans.
And immediately afterward, Budd Schroeder, the chairman of the Shooters Committee on Political Education, a New York gun-rights group, said he planned to meet with every state senator he knew to ask them to stand up to the governor.
''The legislators are going to be getting a lot of phone calls in their district offices,'' Mr. Schroeder said. ''How is taking away my rights to own any type of firearm I choose going to change the attitude of a criminal?''
Yet Mr. Schroeder's group, on its Web site, acknowledged the challenging terrain. ''We can say with certainty,'' it warned, ''that anything short of overwhelming our legislators with calls, e-mails and letters, we have virtually no chance.''
Mr. Cuomo's initiative drew praise from Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who has made gun control his signature cause. ''I was particularly struck by his passionate leadership on gun violence,'' Mr. Bloomberg said in a statement. ''New York State has led the nation with strong, common-sense gun laws, and the governor's new proposals will build on that tradition.''
Mr. Cuomo is a possible 2016 presidential contender who is seeking to elevate his stature among Democrats base nationally, after a much-praised victory on same-sex marriage in his first year in office. His push for enhanced gun control even drew praise from Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan of New York, in a letter that otherwise criticized Mr. Cuomo's support for abortion rights.
Mr. Cuomo had already stirred up anxiety among gun rights groups by saying in a radio interview in December that ''confiscation could be an option'' for existing assault weapons.
But on Wednesday, Mr. Cuomo backed away from that statement. ''This is not about taking away people's guns,'' he said in his State of the State address. ''It is about ending the unnecessary risk of high-capacity assault rifles. That's what this is about.''
The expectation from Senator Dean G. Skelos, the Republican leader, and his aides that the gun-control legislation would come to the Senate floor for a vote is significant; Senate Republicans have consistently rebuffed efforts by Democrats to pass more restrictive gun laws.
But Republicans now have partial control of the chamber because of a coalition they recently established to share power with a group of dissident Democrats who favor more gun control. And Democrats believe that Republican leaders would rather accept a deal than jeopardize their warm relationship with Mr. Cuomo or risk a public relations backlash.
Many Senate Republicans sought re-election in part by touting their bond with the governor, who remains popular with Republican voters as well as with Democrats; Mr. Cuomo, recognizing the extent of his political power, has vowed to travel the state blaming Senate Republicans if they do not back his efforts for gun control.
The gun-control debate had already flared up in other ways in New York State since the shootings last month in Newtown and in Webster, N.Y., where two firefighters were killed. A newspaper's publication of a map showing the names and addresses of gun owners in suburban Westchester and Rockland Counties set off a wave of threats against and harassment of the paper's employees.
In his State of the State address Wednesday, the governor told lawmakers it was their duty to ''stop the madness'' of violence.
''Forget the extremists -- it's simple,'' Mr. Cuomo said to a crescendo of applause. ''No one hunts with an assault rifle. No one needs 10 bullets to kill a deer.''

Police Say Suspect Planned To Blow Up Washington Arch

BYLINE: By WENDY RUDERMAN; Russ Buettner contributed reporting.

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 20

LENGTH: 408 words

A man who was arrested last month on a charge of possession of a chemical explosive in his Greenwich Village apartment recently told acquaintances that he was busy ''making bombs'' to ''blow up'' Washington Arch, a police official said Wednesday. 
In an interview with investigators, the acquaintances said they witnessed the man, Aaron Greene, sprinkling a white powder on the sidewalk inside Washington Square Park and then striking it with a rock, triggering an explosion, according to Paul J. Browne, the Police Department's chief spokesman.
Investigators believe the powder was a chemical called hexamethylene triperoxide diamine, or HMTD, an explosive that police officers said they found last month in the West Ninth Street apartment that Mr. Greene shared with his girlfriend, Morgan Gliedman, Mr. Browne said.
The new details in the case emerged as investigators searched the home of Mr. Greene's friend, Daniel Whittaker, 33, in Orangeburg, N.Y. They said recovered 21 guns, brass knuckles, two stun guns and a switchblade knife.
Police sources also said that investigators found undated letters believed to have been written by Mr. Greene, including one in which they said Mr. Greene repeatedly scrawled the word ''kill'' and wrote the phrase ''kill them all.'' He signed off with a lightning-bolt symbol associated with the SS, Adolf Hitler's bodyguard force.
The police searched the home after Mr. Greene said he had given some of his weapons to ''a friend in law enforcement'' upstate, Mr. Browne said.
''I was charged with no crime,'' Mr. Whittaker, a correction officer, said Wednesday night when reached by phone at his home. ''I am not prepared to say anything more.''
Mr. Greene's lawyer, Lisa J. Pelosi, declined to comment on Wednesday evening.
After receiving a tip, investigators searched the apartment of Mr. Greene, 31, and Ms. Gliedman, 27, on Dec. 29 and confiscated seven grams of HMTD, two shotguns, 60 shotgun shells and a flare launcher. The police, who arrested the two, also discovered instructions for making booby traps and weapons, according to prosecutors and the police.
Mr. Browne said Mr. Greene was ''the focus of the investigation.'' ''His possession of HMTD, a highly unstable explosive -- combined with the discovery of other weapons, manuals on making booby traps and also correspondence that suggests a neo-Nazi affinity -- caused us to be concerned about whatever aspirations he may have had,'' Mr. Browne said.

For Americans Under 50, Stark Findings on Health

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 3

LENGTH: 957 words

Younger Americans die earlier and live in poorer health than their counterparts in other developed countries, with far higher rates of death from guns, car accidents and drug addiction, according to a new analysis of health and longevity in the United States.
Researchers have known for some time that the United States fares poorly in comparison with other rich countries, a trend established in the 1980s. But most studies have focused on older ages, when the majority of people die. 
The findings were stark. Deaths before age 50 accounted for about two-thirds of the difference in life expectancy between males in the United States and their counterparts in 16 other developed countries, and about one-third of the difference for females. The countries in the analysis included Canada, Japan, Australia, France, Germany and Spain.
The 378-page study by a panel of experts convened by the Institute of Medicine and the National Research Council is the first to systematically compare death rates and health measures for people of all ages, including American youths. It went further than other studies in documenting the full range of causes of death, from diseases to accidents to violence. It was based on a broad review of mortality and health studies and statistics.
The panel called the pattern of higher rates of disease and shorter lives ''the U.S. health disadvantage,'' and said it was responsible for dragging the country to the bottom in terms of life expectancy over the past 30 years. American men ranked last in life expectancy among the 17 countries in the study, and American women ranked second to last.
''Something fundamental is going wrong,'' said Dr. Steven Woolf, chairman of the Department of Family Medicine at Virginia Commonwealth University, who led the panel. ''This is not the product of a particular administration or political party. Something at the core is causing the U.S. to slip behind these other high-income countries. And it's getting worse.''
Car accidents, gun violence and drug overdoses were major contributors to years of life lost by Americans before age 50.
The rate of firearm homicides was 20 times higher in the United States than in the other countries, according to the report, which cited a 2011 study of 23 countries. And though suicide rates were lower in the United States, firearm suicide rates were six times higher.
Sixty-nine percent of all American homicide deaths in 2007 involved firearms, compared with an average of 26 percent in other countries, the study said. ''The bottom line is that we are not preventing damaging health behaviors,'' said Samuel Preston, a demographer and sociologist at the University of Pennsylvania, who was on the panel. ''You can blame that on public health officials, or on the health care system. No one understands where responsibility lies.''
Panelists were surprised at just how consistently Americans ended up at the bottom of the rankings. The United States had the second-highest death rate from the most common form of heart disease, the kind that causes heart attacks, and the second-highest death rate from lung disease, a legacy of high smoking rates in past decades. American adults also have the highest diabetes rates.
Youths fared no better. The United States has the highest infant mortality rate among these countries, and its young people have the highest rates of sexually transmitted diseases, teen pregnancy and deaths from car crashes. Americans lose more years of life before age 50 to alcohol and drug abuse than people in any of the other countries.
Americans also had the lowest probability over all of surviving to the age of 50. The report's second chapter details health indicators for youths where the United States ranks near or at the bottom. There are so many that the list takes up four pages. Chronic diseases, including heart disease, also played a role for people under 50.
''We expected to see some bad news and some good news,'' Dr. Woolf said. ''But the U.S. ranked near and at the bottom in almost every heath indicator. That stunned us.''
There were bright spots. Death rates from cancers that can be detected with tests, like breast cancer, were lower in the United States. Adults had better control over their cholesterol and high blood pressure. And the very oldest Americans -- above 75 -- tended to outlive their counterparts.
The panel sought to explain the poor performance. It noted the United States has a highly fragmented health care system, with limited primary care resources and a large uninsured population. It has the highest rates of poverty among the countries studied.
Education also played a role. Americans who have not graduated from high school die from diabetes at three times the rate of those with some college, Dr. Woolf said. In the other countries, more generous social safety nets buffer families from the health consequences of poverty, the report said.
Still, even the people most likely to be healthy, like college-educated Americans and those with high incomes, fare worse on many health indicators.
The report also explored less conventional explanations. Could cultural factors like individualism and dislike of government interference play a role? Americans are less likely to wear seat belts and more likely to ride motorcycles without helmets.
The United States is a bigger, more heterogeneous society with greater levels of economic inequality, and comparing its health outcomes to those in countries like Sweden or France may seem lopsided. But the panelists point out that this country spends more on health care than any other in the survey. And as recently as the 1950s, Americans scored better in life expectancy and disease than many of the other countries in the current study.

Woman Is Shot In Brooklyn

BYLINE: By THE NEW YORK TIMES

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 21

LENGTH: 216 words

A woman in her 90s was shot twice by a gunman in a moving car around sunset on Wednesday in the East New York section of Brooklyn, the police said. 
The woman was in serious but stable condition at Brookdale University Hospital, the police said. She appeared to have been caught in the cross-fire when the gunman shot at a group on foot near Blake and Miller Avenues.
The authorities declined to name the woman, but Alvin Johnson, 55, identified her as his mother, Gloria.
He said she had been shot twice in the right arm. She had just left her apartment on Miller Avenue, using a cane, he said. She had a cart full of laundry and was with her home attendant, he said.
The New York Fire Department said the shooting occurred at 4:25 p.m.
Eventon Samudam, 47, was sitting on a stoop close to the shooting.
''We heard three shots,'' he said. ''I ran inside and got right down on my belly. Then this big crowd of kids went running by. By the time I came out, this old woman was lying there on the sidewalk.''
The police said no arrests had been made by Wednesday evening.
''The doctors said she's going to be O.K.,'' Mr. Johnson said of his mother, who is a deacon at a local church.
''She was really scared,'' he added. ''I hugged her and tried to tell her it was going to be all right. She's sleeping now.''

Afghan Amnesty Program Falls Short, Leaving Ex-Insurgents Regretful and Angry

BYLINE: By AZAM AHMED; Sangar Rahimi contributed reporting from Mehtar Lam, and Taimoor Shah from Kandahar.

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 5

LENGTH: 1137 words

MEHTAR LAM, Afghanistan -- Eidi Mohammed, a former Taliban commander who recently renounced violence and sought amnesty under the Afghan government's reconciliation program, has had another change of heart. Now he is thinking about rejoining his old comrades. Jobless and losing hope he will ever find work, Mr. Mohammed, 38, took his frustrations to provincial officials. They told him there was nothing they could do.
''The moment I feel like I can move, I will go back to the mountains, rearm myself and fight you again,'' Mr. Mohammed, who is recovering from a recent gunshot wound to the leg caused by a clash with a police officer, recalled warning the governor, police chief and top security official of Badghis Province.
He is not alone. Interviews with more than a dozen former insurgents find a group embittered and torn about their choice to lay down their arms. Many are unable to work and often unable to return to their villages for safety reasons; most feel the government has cheated them. 
''I am just counting the days before someone kills me,'' said Akhtar Mohammad, a former Taliban commander in Oruzgan. ''Every passing moment I feel regret for joining the peace process.''
Mr. Mohammad, who is from the south, where the insurgency is the deadliest, said the only thing he had to show for his decision to switch sides was the turban he had been given for his reintegration ceremony.
Two years into one of the most ambitious efforts to lure Taliban fighters off the battlefield, many Afghan and Western officials acknowledge that the results have been disappointing. Though the number of people claiming the amnesty has swelled in the past year, violence remains high in the hotbeds of the insurgency, where the program has struggled to take hold.
Of the roughly 6,100 participants so far, 80 percent come from the relatively peaceful north and west of the country, where the Taliban presence is thinnest. And even some of those fighters say their activity was more criminal than political or ideological, even though the program was designed to flip the most committed fighters.
Many onetime fighters say they were only loosely affiliated with the Taliban. Though widely thought of as a unified Islamic movement, the Taliban in reality consist of a shifting constellation of forces whose agendas sometimes line up. Many of the insurgents who have given up fighting said they were formerly of Hezb-e-Islami, a rival faction to the Taliban that has been losing power and influence in recent years.
Although some fighters have found employment, Western officials argue that the reintegration initiative was never meant to be a jobs program. It pays a modest stipend, about $100 to $200 monthly for the first three months, depending on the fighter's rank. In theory, the former fighters can find work on development projects financed in their home villages, though many projects have failed to get off the ground.
In two years, the so-called High Peace Council has spent less than half of what officials hoped to spend in 2011 alone. Tight controls have stalled village development projects meant to employ the former insurgents in their communities. About $180 million of the $235 million the program was granted sits idle in Afghan coffers.
The officials running the program called it a work in progress that would improve over time. The importance of employment for former fighters is acknowledged as an important element of keeping them from picking up arms again.
''We're working on ways to improve the effectiveness of the program,'' said Paul Martin Mason, who oversees the reintegration program for the United Nations Development Program.
In the meantime, many former fighters are expressing second thoughts with their decisions. Having tired of endless fighting, Hazrat Mir, a former Taliban commander in Laghman, joined the government with 130 of his men last year.
With promises of jobs and land, Mr. Mir said, his men left their villages and turned in their weapons, a dangerous prospect given the threat from former comrades. The danger, it turned out, was made clear by an attack the day before their reintegration ceremony in which the Taliban killed Mr. Mir's top deputy.
''It's been 11 months, and the government hasn't given us anything,'' Mr. Mir complained. ''We've spent all of our money living in the capital, where we don't know anyone.''
The governor of Laghman Province, Fazlullah Mujadidi, extolled the virtues of the reintegration program during an interview in the pale-blue parlor of his tidy government compound. The roads are clear, and the Taliban no longer operate with impunity, he said. The reintegration effort, which has drawn in 276 former insurgents, has been a remarkable success, he said.
A bear-size man with a heavy beard, Mr. Mujadidi counted out on each finger the new development projects headed to his districts thanks to the program: a dam, a major road and wells.
Asked about Hazrat Mir and his men's frustrations, Mr. Mujadidi grew silent.
''We can confirm those details,'' he said of Mr. Mir's account, adding that the various projects he listed are still in the application phase. ''We don't have the resources at the provincial level to support them.''
Some former Taliban commanders suspect bit players in the insurgency have been used to pad the data and make the program appear more effective than it really is.
''If we believe the figures of the High Peace Council, then the Taliban should be weakened significantly,'' said Syed Muhammad Akbar Agha, a former Taliban commander, seated in his frigid living room on the outskirts of Kabul. ''But they are not.''
''I doubt 2 out of every 1,500 are true Taliban fighters,'' he added.
All who switch sides, though, face real threats. While the government said it did not collect data on the number of enrollees killed, the Taliban have taken steps to target as many as possible.
In Kapisa, a restive province northeast of Kabul, just seven fighters have laid down arms since the program started. That, in part, is because the Taliban fatally shot one of the early defectors, Qand Agha.
Abdul Malik, a former comrade of Mr. Agha's, said gunmen recently tried to storm his home in the dead of night. He fought them off with his assault rifle, a weapon he was allowed to keep for self-defense after renouncing the Taliban. But a farmer found a bomb the next morning that had been left behind in a field by his house.
In addition to complaining about the lack of security, Mr. Malik said the government broke its promise to give him a job with the Afghan Local Police.
''I've told everyone I know not to join the government,'' he said.
Abdul Momen Muslim, who as chairman of the Kapisa peace council persuaded Mr. Malik to join the government, agreed.
''I can no longer in good conscience tell people to come to the government,'' he said.

Democracy in the House

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; EDITORIAL; Pg. 22

LENGTH: 563 words

The only reason that income taxes on 99 percent of Americans did not go up this month was that Speaker John Boehner briefly broke with an iron rule of Republican control over the House. He allowed the fiscal-cliff deal to be put to a full vote of the House even though a strong majority of Republicans opposed it.
That informal rule, which bars a vote on legislation unless it has the support of a majority of Republicans, has been one of the biggest stumbling blocks to progress and consensus in Congress, and, in its own way, is even more pernicious than the filibuster abuse that often ties up the Senate. Under the 60-vote requirement to break a filibuster, at least, coalitions can occasionally be formed between the Democratic majority and enough Republicans to reach the three-fifths threshold. 
But under the majority-of-the-majority rule in the House, Democrats are completely cut out of the governing process, not even given a chance to vote unless Republicans have decided to pass something. Since 2010, there have been enough extremist Republicans in the caucus to block consideration of most of the bills requested by the White House or sent over from the Senate. If President Obama is for something, it's a safe bet that most House Republicans are against it, and thus won't bring it up.
That's why the House never took a vote on the Senate's latest five-year farm bill. Or the Violence Against Women Act. Or a full six-year transportation bill. Republican opposition prevented consideration in the last term of the Senate's $60 billion in providing relief from Hurricane Sandy; so far, the House has been willing to approve only a measly $9.7 billion after members claimed the Senate's bill was full of (nonexistent) pork.
The House has always been a sprawling, unruly chamber, and its leaders have long used some form of control to choose which bills reach the floor and to push their party's policies. The majority-of-the-majority requirement, however, is relatively new and entirely a Republican creation. Newt Gingrich occasionally used it when he was speaker, but it was institutionalized in 2004 by Speaker Dennis Hastert (and Tom DeLay, the power behind the throne).
This anti-democratic tactic, now known as the ''Hastert rule,'' helped turn the chamber into a one-party institution that utterly silenced the minority. A post-9/11 intelligence reform bill, urgently sought by President George W. Bush, was bottled up by Mr. Hastert and his allies, who knew it would pass if Democrats were allowed to vote.
This was not a rule used by Democrats. Speaker Tom Foley allowed the North American Free Trade Agreement to pass in 1993 on mostly Republican votes, and when Nancy Pelosi took the job in 2007, she repudiated the Hastert rule, allowing both parties to vote together on legislation. For example, she allowed a bill to pass paying for the Iraq war over the objections of most Democrats.
''I'm the speaker of the House,'' she said at the time. ''I have to take into consideration something broader than the majority of the majority in the Democratic caucus.''
That's an attitude rarely expressed by Mr. Boehner. But if the country is to move forward on issues with widespread support -- getting past the debt limit, immigration reform, gun control, and investments in education and infrastructure -- he will have to let the two parties vote together on a solution.

Do Guns Make Us More Safe, or Less?

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; LETTERS; Pg. 22

LENGTH: 721 words

To the Editor:
Re ''After Pinpointing Gun Owners, Paper Is a Target'' (front page, Jan. 7):
Am I the only person confused by the inconsistent reasoning of America's most vociferous pro-gun supporters? Since the tragedy in Newtown, Conn., pro-gun activists have insisted that ''bad'' people with guns would stay away from places where they knew that ''good'' people, too, had guns. Thus they advise arming the ''good'' people.
But now we learn from the president of the Westchester County Firearms Owners Association that its members are ''really upset'' with a local newspaper that published public records identifying the names and addresses of the area's presumably ''good'' gun owners, and that those identified are ''afraid for their families.'' 
Huh? If ''bad'' people with guns will be deterred by knowing which ''good'' people also have guns, shouldn't identifying them assure the ''good'' ones of more safety, not less?
And speaking of safety, how come those ''really upset'' gun owners are threatening to destroy the incomes of, and even to shoot, the owners and employees of the offending newspaper? I thought they were supposed to be the ''good'' people. Maybe that's the problem in America these days. It's so hard to tell the ''good'' people from the ''bad'' ones.
JUDY BALABAN Beverly Hills, Calif., Jan. 7, 2013
To the Editor:
In your article, a Journal News reporter, Dwight R. Worley, defends his newspaper's publishing of gun owner names and addresses by saying, ''The people have as much of a right to know who owns guns in their communities as gun owners have to own weapons.''
That's not true. The right to own a gun as well as the right to privacy are both constitutionally protected, while there is no ''right'' to know whether your neighbor has a gun. That latter claim reflects a misunderstanding of New York's Freedom of Information Act.
The intent of the law was not to facilitate the government's revealing sensitive information about its citizenry, but rather to make sure the government cannot conceal its own ineptitude or malfeasance from any legitimate inquiry from the media or any other private interest.
The Journal News's action was outside the spirit of the law. The State Legislature and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo now need to amend the law to avoid such journalistic abuse.
D. M. MARKOWITZ Wilton, N.Y., Jan. 7, 2013
To the Editor:
''More Guns = More Killing'' (Sunday Review, Jan. 6), detailing the dangers of arming school guards, is based on hard data and not the emotionalism of the Sandy Hook horror or the politics of the National Rifle Association.
In most schools there are from 5 to 40 exterior doors and more than 20 easily accessible first-floor classrooms. Students are transported on buses, go on field trips, play athletic contests both home and away, and attend summer school. It is complete folly to advocate armed guards, since you would need a military squad to truly safeguard any building.
More important, as your article indicates, every time a weapon is fired, ''everyone is vulnerable.''
How would parents feel if their child were a victim of what the military calls ''collateral damage''? ROBERT RICKEN Floral Park, Queens, Jan. 6, 2013
The writer is a retired school superintendent.
To the Editor:
I have only seven guns in my house. As a resident of rural South Texas, this makes me practically a Quaker. Some of my guns I bought, some I inherited from my father and some I held for my son while he was in the Army.
I hunt on rare occasions and enjoy a little target shooting. I've killed a dozen rattlesnakes and a rabid raccoon on my place. A couple of times I was comforted to have a gun when I politely asked trespassers to leave my property -- now.
The point is I like my guns, but I do not love them. Love is reserved for the likes of the children and teachers who died so senselessly in Sandy Hook. This and other recent tragedies serve to focus our minds on a complex blend of Second Amendment rights, public safety, civil society and mental health. I do not know what solution we will ultimately find.
My own personal and immediate reaction, though, was to take a large-capacity ammo clip and pound it down with a hammer. My ranch rifle works fine without it, and it was stupid to have. I don't need it, and I don't think anyone does.

Out of Prison With Little Time to Waste

BYLINE: By MIKE HALE

SECTION: Section C; Column 0; Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk; TELEVISION REVIEW; Pg. 18

LENGTH: 763 words

''Banshee,'' the latest action-and-attitude series from Cinemax, comes on strong -- almost comically so. In the first few minutes the show's unnamed hero walks out of prison and down some mood-setting railroad tracks, has sex with a waitress and steals a muscle car. Having checked those items off the hard-boiled mystery man's to-do list, he branches out, tracking down an Asian hairdresser-drag queen from his past, getting shot at and chased through the streets of Lower Manhattan and narrowly avoiding death by a sliding double-decker bus. 
Perhaps the hyperbolic opening of Friday night's premiere -- part comic book, part ''Die Hard With a Vengeance'' -- reflects some nervousness, an instance of trying too hard to please, on the part of the show's creators. While ''Banshee'' has television pros like Greg Yaitanes (''House M.D.'') and Alan Ball (''True Blood,'' ''Six Feet Under'') among its crew of producers and directors, it was developed and written by Jonathan Tropper and David Schickler, a pair of New York novelists and screenwriters with limited practical experience. This appears to be the first actual TV production either has been involved with. (An accompanying online and print graphic novel, ''Banshee: Origins,'' certifies the writers' taste for cartoon-style storytelling.)
The pace slows after those precredits pyrotechnics, a shift signaled immediately by the sight of the hero (the New Zealand actor Antony Starr), now on a motorcycle, cruising past Pennsylvania Dutch farmers in straw hats and white shirts. Cinemax's first two serious original series, ''Strike Back'' and ''Hunted,'' were both international thrillers, favoring exoticism in their guns, locations and naked women. ''Banshee'' is a different beast, an American Gothic noir with echoes of Jim Thompson, Frank Miller and, especially, Quentin Tarantino, and it presents a different set of images and clichיs to play around with.
How interesting that play will be is hard to tell from the two episodes sent to critics, which are mostly spent setting up what feels like an unusually elaborate premise. (Though it could just be unusually long winded.) Arriving in the rural town of Banshee, Pa., in search of the woman who was his lover and partner in crime 15 years ago, the protagonist -- who exhibits both a standard-issue laconic likableness and a talent for violence -- seizes the opportunity to assume the identity of one Lucas Hood, who dies just before starting his new job as sheriff.
The new Hood's motives are part of the mystery -- is he more concerned with retrieving the stolen diamonds that landed him in prison, or with winning back the woman (Ivana Milicevic) who helped him steal them, now a mom and a real estate agent married to the local prosecutor? Among the complicating factors in the story are two distinct villains, a local crime boss as well as the big-league gangster from whom the diamonds were stolen, and Hood's three-member police force, confused by their new boss's quasi-legal methods and inability to fill out paperwork.
Through two hours this all feels more artificial and cooked up than involving, though the small-town locations, shot in North Carolina, look great, and the occasional line of dialogue draws a chuckle: ''Ah, you've seen 'Witness,' '' Hood's deputy says. ''That's great.'' More often, though, the writing is the kind of strained pulp -- ''This don't concern you, Sugar.'' ''All the same, I am concerned'' -- that only works if delivered with more style than ''Banshee,'' so far, delivers. The cast, including Hoon Lee as the hairdresser-fixer and Frankie Faison as a wise old ex-boxer, is competent but not at the Samuel L. Jackson level that would be required to put a real spin on the material.
I don't know what direction the 10-episode season will take, but there's at least one promising possibility: that it will dial down the dull continuing mystery and focus on the weekly travails of the fish-out-of-water Hood, a career criminal trying to maintain order in a place he doesn't understand. What looks like a flat noir thriller could still make for a pretty entertaining police procedural.
Banshee

Mr. Holmes is scheduled to be arraigned Friday, but his defense filed papers Thursday that he is not ready to enter a plea.

A 16-year-old boy with a shotgun shot a fellow student on Thursday and was taken into custody after staff members talked him into putting down the gun, law enforcement officials said. The teenager walked into a classroom at Taft Union High School just before 9 a.m. and shot a male student in the chest, then fired at another student and missed, said Ray Pruitt, a spokesman for the Kern County Sheriff's Office. A teacher who began to evacuate students through a rear door in the room and a campus supervisor persuaded the teenager to put down the gun. The victim was in critical condition in a hospital.

Beware Stubby Glasses

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

LENGTH: 797 words

If you want to deter crime, it seems that you'd want to lengthen prison sentences so that criminals would face steeper costs for breaking the law. In fact, a mountain of research shows that increases in prison terms have done nothing to deter crime. Criminals, like the rest of us, aren't much influenced by things they might have to experience far in the future.
If a police officer witnesses the death of his partner, it seems that you'd want to quickly send in a grief counselor. In fact, this sort of immediate counseling freezes and fortifies memories of the trauma, making the aftershocks more damaging. 
If you want to get people to vote more, it seems you'd want to tell them what a problem low turnout is. In fact, if you want people to vote, tell them everybody else is already voting and they should join the club. Voting is mostly about social membership and personal expression.
These are three examples of policies and practices that are based on bad psychology. The list of examples could go on and fill this page. That's because we spend trillions of dollars putting policies and practices into place, but most of these efforts are based on the crudest possible psychological guesswork.
Fortunately, people in the behavioral sciences are putting policies to the test. I know of groups at Duke and Penn that are applying behavioral research findings to policy issues. Eldar Shafir of Princeton has edited a weighty new book, ''The Behavioral Foundations of Public Policy,'' which is a master compendium of what we know.
One of the things we know is that seemingly trivial changes can have big effects. People who are presented with a wide variety of choices of, say, yogurt, will eat more than people who are presented with a small array of choices or no choice. People who were randomly given a short, wide 22-ounce glass, poured 88 percent more juice or soda into it than people who were offered a tall, narrow 22-ounce glass, but they believed they only poured in half as much as they actually did.
Sometimes the behavioral research leads us to completely change how we think about an issue. For example, many of our anti-discrimination policies focus on finding the bad apples who are explicitly prejudiced. In fact, the serious discrimination is implicit, subtle and nearly universal. Both blacks and whites subtly try to get a white partner when asked to team up to do an intellectually difficult task. In computer shooting simulations, both black and white participants were more likely to think black figures were armed. In emergency rooms, whites are pervasively given stronger painkillers than blacks or Hispanics. Clearly, we should spend more effort rigging situations to reduce universal, unconscious racism.
The research is also leading to new policy approaches. The most famous involve default settings. Roughly 98 percent of people take part in organ donor programs in European countries where you have to check a box to opt out. Only 10 percent or 20 percent take part in neighboring countries where you have to check a box to opt in.
In one clever program, dieters were told to phone in their weight to a nurse daily. Every day they called, they got an encouraging text and a lottery ticket, with a chance of winning a small amount. These dieters lost three times more weight than people who didn't get tickets. Another ingenious program automatically diverts some money into your savings account every time you buy a state lottery ticket.
Prime Minister David Cameron's government in Britain has gone furthest in implementing these sorts of programs. Personalized text messages were found to be six times more effective in getting people to pay fines than warning letters. If you tell people what percentage of their neighbors has already paid their taxes, you are more likely to get late filers to actually pay than if you nag them another way.
My problem with these efforts is that they are still so modest. What about the big problems? How do we get people to restrain government commitments now so that debt down the road won't be so ruinous? How do we calculate the multiplier effects of tax cuts or spending increases among different subgroups of the population, or under different emotional conditions? How do we rig the context of budget negotiations so participants can actually come to a deal? How are people in different cultures likely to react to drone strikes? How do we structure sanctions against Iran to cause the greatest psychic humiliation?
These are the big questions, and most of our policies rely on crude folk psychology from a few politicians. But there's hope. As Brian Wansink notes in Eldar Shafir's volume, the 20th century saw great gains in sanitation and public health. The 21st century could be a great period for behavior change.

Obama's Chief of Staff Pick Is Said to Be Down to 2

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 15

LENGTH: 1097 words

WASHINGTON -- President Obama on Thursday publicly acknowledged the big problem that he has created for himself by picking for the next Treasury secretary Jacob J. Lew, his trusted White House chief of staff. The shift left a vacancy in one of his administration's, and Washington's, most powerful if least understood jobs.
''I don't want to see him go because it's working out really well for me to have him here in the White House,'' the president joked in an East Room ceremony alongside Mr. Lew and the man he would succeed at Treasury if confirmed by the Senate, Timothy F. Geithner. 
But having nominated Mr. Lew to move next door to the Treasury Department, Mr. Obama for the fifth time must choose the aide who will be the Oval Office gatekeeper for every problem and person, domestic and foreign, that come before the president, and who is often the last to speak to Mr. Obama before he makes a decision. The title of White House chief of staff hardly conveys the reach of the officeholder; responsibility extends far beyond the White House, throughout the departments and agencies of the executive branch and to relations with Congress.
''It is the first person and the last person the president talks to, outside the vice president,'' said Rahm Emanuel, Mr. Obama's first and at 20 months his longest-serving chief of staff, and now the mayor of Chicago. ''And it is both a chief -- meaning top dog -- but it is also staff.''
''I would argue that they are the second-most-powerful person really in the free world, behind the president and occasionally a vice president like Dick Cheney,'' said David B. Cohen, a political scientist at the University of Akron who is writing a book on White House chiefs of staff. ''It is the most powerful unelected position. Chiefs of staff are responsible for everything -- I mean everything -- that comes into the White House.''
The fact that Mr. Obama has burned through four chiefs in four years -- a contrast with Treasury, where Mr. Geithner stayed for the entire term and does not leave until Jan. 25, after the president's second-term inaugural -- is a testament to the unique difficulties and pressures of a job that really became institutionalized only with the Nixon administration. The chief of staff has cabinet status in this administration but ultimately is defined both by the times and the personalities involved.
While the turnover has been greater than for past presidents, Mr. Obama's term was complicated by a global economic crisis and two wars. The musical chairs also seem to reflect Mr. Obama's own shifting conception of what he wants from the job, however.
In Mr. Emanuel, a driven Congressional leader and a former Clinton White House adviser, Mr. Obama chose someone with the energy and legislative savvy to pass an ambitious agenda through a Congress then controlled by Democrats. When Mr. Emanuel left sooner than expected in late 2010 -- his party's nomination for Chicago mayor suddenly was up for grabs, but he also had alienated people in and out of the White House -- Mr. Obama enlisted one of his most trusted advisers, Pete Rouse, as an interim chief of staff.
Because Mr. Rouse initially did not want the job long term, and Republicans had taken control of the House after 2010, Mr. Obama next tapped William M. Daley, a Chicago executive and a longtime fixture in Democratic politics, hoping that Mr. Daley could build bridges to both Republicans and disenchanted business leaders. But Mr. Daley was unable to do so and also antagonized Democrats in Congress -- an occupational hazard for chiefs of staff in most administrations, as Mr. Lew found out after he became chief in January 2012.
In the low-key, pragmatically liberal Mr. Lew, Mr. Obama seemed to have found a kindred spirit and a good fit. Yet Mr. Lew, whose wife remains in New York, had made it known that he did not want to stay on as chief of staff. So Mr. Obama enticed him to stay in Washington by offering the Treasury portfolio, which, given the budget battles with Republicans in Congress, is now more oriented toward Mr. Lew's expertise in fiscal policy than it was when Mr. Geithner became secretary amid worldwide financial peril.
For some weeks, then, associates say, Mr. Obama has been considering just two other men to succeed Mr. Lew: Denis R. McDonough, the current deputy national security adviser in the White House, and Ronald A. Klain, former chief of staff to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., and before that to Al Gore.
Mr. Biden has not weighed in heavily with Mr. Obama, officials say, because he knows the president is aware of his regard for Mr. Klain but also because Mr. Biden likes and respects Mr. McDonough.
What is striking, especially at a time when Mr. Obama has come under criticism for the scarcity of women among his top officials, is that both the deputy chiefs of staff to Mr. Lew are well-regarded women and neither seems to have been considered for promotion.
Nancy-Ann DeParle, 56, has been one of Mr. Obama's closest advisers, especially on the 2010 health care law, and in the Clinton administration she headed the agency for Medicare and Medicaid; she will leave after the inauguration and will lecture at Harvard Law School and join the Brookings Institution. Alyssa Mastromonaco, relatively young at 36, has managed Mr. Obama's logistical and travel arrangements since he first started running for president six years ago, and will remain as deputy chief of staff for operations, responsible for overseeing scheduling, personnel and much more.
The president's hesitation about choosing Mr. McDonough, 43, is his lack of domestic policy experience at a time when issues of the federal budget, immigration and gun violence are second-term priorities. But since the 2008 campaign, Mr. McDonough has been perhaps Mr. Obama's closest confidant on national security and foreign policy, enjoying access and trust beyond his position. As the principal deputy to the national security adviser, Thomas E. Donilon, Mr. McDonough has helped assemble Mr. Obama's new national security team, including the nominees for the Defense and State departments.
Mr. Klain, 51, is now an adviser to the AOL co-founder Steve Case, but much of his career has been as a counsel to Congressional Democrats and then in the Clinton and Obama administrations. Known as an aggressive and organized lawyer, he helped both John F. Kerry in 2004 and then Mr. Obama last fall with preparations for their presidential campaign debates. As a two-time chief of staff to a vice president, he was included for years in White House deliberations.

Raised by Political Activists in a Dictatorship's Shadow

BYLINE: By MANOHLA DARGIS

SECTION: Section C; Column 0; Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk; MOVIE REVIEW; Pg. 7

LENGTH: 747 words

In ''Clandestine Childhood'' a 12-year-old Argentine boy is forced into playing a dangerous game of pretend. It's 1979, three years after a military coup d'יtat at home and exile in Cuba with his family. Now the boy, Juan (Teo Gutiיrrez Moreno), who will go by Ernesto, is returning to Argentina with his parents, Charo (Natalia Oreiro) and Daniel (Cיsar Troncoso), and his baby sister, Victoria. ''We think,'' Charo tells Juan, ''it's the right time to carry on fighting.'' In between changing diapers she and Daniel will soon be fighting Argentina's right-wing military dictatorship in the name of freedom and country -- and saluting fallen compaסeros with rousing cries of ''Perףn or death!'' 
That this Perףn -- presumably the other Juan dear to this family, the Argentine president also known to millions of Broadway musical fans as Evita's husband -- has been dead since 1974 doesn't appear to have dampened Charo and Daniel's revolutionary fervor. ''Clandestine Childhood'' charts their fight as members of a group called the Montoneros Organization, though it mostly centers on Juan's confused, at times confusing role as a witness to his parents' passion and good, bad and foolish decisions. Lending the story an extra shiver is that the director, Benjamםn ֱvila, making his feature debut, has said that the movie isn't just drawn from true events, but also his life. The photographs that run with the final credits poignantly suggest just how personal it is.
The story of parents forced to live underground with their choices and their children has been told in the films ''Running on Empty'' (about American 1970s radicals turned mom-and-pop fugitives) and ''The State I Am In'' (German radicals reminiscent of the Baader-Meinhof gang). One big difference is that the parents in ''Clandestine Childhood'' aren't fleeing the law because of their past deeds but are trying violently to overthrow a current dictatorship. Juan and his sister are in constant danger partly because of Charo and Daniel's bullets and ideology, living in a perilous reality that the children have had no say in. The military junta is the graver threat, no doubt, but the family's life in the shadows does force the question: Do urban guerrillas make good parents?
From Juan's point of view, which the movie largely sticks to, the answer initially seems clear. Charo and Daniel, as well as Juan's Uncle Beto (Ernesto Alterio), are exemplary: principled, dedicated, funny, warm, loving. Mr. ֱvila, yet another filmmaker clearly in thrall to Terrence Malick, makes the case for Charo and Daniel with each beautifully lighted and framed shot of the family laughing and playing together or Juan off in his own world. There are many such images. Working with the director of photography Ivבn Gierasinchuk and shooting in high-end digital, Mr. ֱvila creates an intimate, richly tactile and impressionistic picture of a once-upon-a-time in childhood, using close-ups of hands, mouths and eyes in certain scenes that feel more remembered than lived in.
That ''Clandestine Childhood'' is running on memories is underscored by an early, vividly animated interlude by Andy Riva that has a jagged, blunt graphic-novel look that's better suited to the story's grimmer truths. (Mr. Riva also animated several other sequences, including a light, bright, childlike one with Che Guevara.) The animated sections pop, but it's unclear if Juan sees his life as a comic book and is coping with its brute reality by transforming it into a cartoon. Or is Mr. ֱvila -- who, in telling this seductive, adult story through a child, ended up limiting its depth and scope -- trying to say something about personal and political memory? When a filmmaker proves as reluctant as Mr. ֱvila to speak up about the past, to engage with its full complexity, it can be hard to hear what he's saying.
Clandestine Childhood
Opens on Friday in Manhattan.

Governor of Colorado Calls for Stricter Controls on Gun Sales

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 17

LENGTH: 632 words

DENVER -- Nearly six months after a mass shooting in a Colorado movie theater stirred cries for action on gun violence and mental illness, and with last month's killings at Connecticut's Sandy Hook Elementary School still fresh in people's minds, Gov. John W. Hickenlooper of Colorado called Thursday for universal background checks on all gun sales in the state.
''We can learn from tragedy and make changes,'' Mr. Hickenlooper, a Democrat, said in his annual State of the State address at the gold-domed Capitol here. 
After the massacre at Columbine High School in a Denver suburb in 1999, Colorado voters passed regulations requiring background checks at gun shows, which were already required for sales at retail gun stores. But background checks are still not required for individual, private sales of firearms -- estimated by some lawmakers to make up 40 percent of gun sales in the state.
Democrats, who now control both houses of Colorado's Legislature, rose to their feet and applauded the governor's proposal while Republicans sat silently -- an illustration of the divisions in a state that tipped to Democrats in the last two presidential elections, but that still values hunting, sport-shooting and the frontier values wrapped up in gun ownership.
''It is an infringement on our Second Amendment rights,'' said Scott Renfroe, a Republican state senator from Greeley, in northern Colorado. ''You can't make enough laws to stop the criminals. Criminals never obey the law. All you're doing is making it harder for citizens to enjoy the rights they have in this country.''
Mr. Hickenlooper, a former mayor of Denver, geologist and brewpub owner, also reiterated calls for the Legislature to pass civil union legislation for same-sex couples -- a near certainty given the new Democratic majorities in both houses. Last May, Republicans, who then controlled the State House of Representatives, defeated a civil unions bill.
He said that Colorado's economy was back from the depths of the recession, though the state unemployment rate is still 7.7 percent, on par with the national level, according to the most recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. He also said that regulators were working to determine the legal and policy effects of a voter-approved measure that legalized small amounts of marijuana and called for new laws to guard against people who drive while impaired.
In large part, the governor's speech was shaped by a year tainted by tragedy.
He led a moment of silence for the 12 people killed and scores wounded in the Aurora theater shooting in July. He discussed a drought that destroyed fields and crops, and summertime wildfires that charred hundreds of homes and forced thousands of people to flee.
Over the last several months, Mr. Hickenlooper has slowly waded into the emotionally charged debate over gun control.
Immediately after the July 20 shootings, he said the time was not right to talk about passing new gun restrictions, saying in an appearance on ''Meet the Press'' that tougher laws would not have prevented the gunman from carrying out his rampage.
In recent weeks, the governor has proposed significant changes to the state's mental health system, including new mental health centers, a new statewide crisis line and a plan to make mental health records easily available for background checks of potential gun owners. He has also implored lawmakers to begin tackling the debate over gun control.
The governor's call for universal background checks reflects similar ideas put forth by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. after the Connecticut shootings. Mr. Hickenlooper, however, stopped short of proposing a ban on assault weapons or outlawing high-capacity ammunition magazines, which are being pursued in New York.

America's Health Disadvantage

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; EDITORIAL; Pg. 22

LENGTH: 422 words

It is no secret that the United States spends a lot more on health care than any other country yet ranks far behind other advanced nations in keeping its citizens healthy. This has been well documented in studies of older people and of newborn infants. It is now shockingly clear that poor health is a much broader and deeper problem than past studies have suggested. 
An authoritative report issued by the Institute of Medicine this week found that, on average, Americans experience higher rates of disease and injury and die sooner than people in other high-income countries. That is true at all ages between birth and 75 and for even well-off Americans who mistakenly think that top-tier medical care ensures that they will remain in good health. The study found that even upper-income Americans with health insurance and college educations appear to be sicker than their peers in other rich nations.
The study was commissioned by the National Institutes of Health, the federal government's top medical research agency, and was carried out by experts appointed by the National Research Council and the Institute of Medicine, two units of the prestigious National Academy of Sciences. It is the first analysis to compare the burden of multiple diseases and injuries in the United States and 16 other affluent democracies, including Western European countries, Australia, Canada and Japan.
American men ranked last in life expectancy among the 17 countries and American women ranked next to last. The United States also ranked at or near the bottom in nine areas, including heart disease, chronic lung disease, obesity and diabetes, injuries and homicides, and sexually transmitted diseases. ''We were struck by the gravity of these findings,'' said the panel chairman, Dr. Steven Woolf, a professor of family medicine at Virginia Commonwealth University. ''What concerns our panel is why, for decades, we have been slipping behind.''
Likely explanations include a large uninsured population and more limited access to primary care, two problems that should be mitigated by the health care reforms that will kick in next year; higher levels of poverty and income inequality in this country; weaker safety net programs; sedentary lifestyles and obesity; higher rates of drug abuse and traffic accidents that involve alcohol; and greater use of firearms in acts of violence.
The panel suggested a campaign to raise public awareness of the American health disadvantage and a study of what other countries are doing that might be useful here.

These Law Enforcers Will Stop at Nothing

BYLINE: By A. O. SCOTT.

SECTION: Section C; Column 0; Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk; MOVIE REVIEW; Pg. 12

LENGTH: 786 words

''Gangster Squad'' is less a movie than a costume party run amok. Set in a late-'40s Los Angeles painted in cartoon colors rather than noir shadows, it is a hectic jumble of fedoras and zoot suits, stockings and cigarettes, and red femme-fatale dresses. The accessories of choice are guns of various calibers and styles, deployed to drown out -- or perhaps to emphasize -- knucklehead dialogue and inept storytelling.
The script, by Will Beall (and based on a book by Paul Lieberman), is flecked with enough period idioms to suggest a Google Docs search though some of the writings of Raymond Chandler and Mickey Spillane. ''Who's the tomato?'' asks Sgt. Jerry Wooters (Ryan Gosling) when he spies a beautiful woman in the company of a notorious crime boss. The produce in question is Grace Faraday, played by Emma Stone, who falls hard for Jerry's patter, even though he is a member of the L.A.P.D., and she is the moll of Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn), a vicious former boxer with an expanding criminal empire. 
Opposing Mickey's rise is the titular Gangster Squad, a secret police posse under the command of Sgt. John O'Mara (Josh Brolin). O'Mara, a straight arrow combat veteran with an anxious wife (Mireille Enos) and a baby boomer on the way, lays down a ponderous chunk of voice-over before settling down to assemble his team, which has the structure of a classic combat movie platoon. There is a sly old coot with deadly aim (Robert Patrick); his Mexican-American sidekick (Michael Peסa); a black detective (Anthony Mackie); and the requisite egghead (Giovanni Ribisi), who has an advanced knowledge of the era's high-tech gadgetry.
Rather than assemble a case against Mickey -- the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act is well in the future -- the squad undertakes a guerrilla campaign meant to disrupt his businesses. They raid casinos and cathouses, intercept drug shipments and burn piles of cash, with maximal noise and minimal regard for the niceties of due process.
Cohen is a real figure in the lurid annals of the Southern California underworld, and the tale of his rise and fall is ripe with nasty potential. The old-time Los Angeles of corrupt cops, conniving villains and melancholy sexpots may be familiar pop-culture territory -- it's ''Chinatown,'' Jake, and also ''L.A. Confidential,'' ''Devil With a Blue Dress'' and the collected works of James Ellroy -- but it is also a storehouse of durably knotty themes. In the movie-fed, noir-tinged American imagination, this is a city where sex, power, money and celebrity entwine and collide, where social dysfunction and psychological disorder fester amid the stucco and the jacaranda.
None of which seems to interest Ruben Fleischer, the director of ''Gangster Squad,'' a barrage of action sequences as empty as a spent shell casing. His first feature, ''Zombieland,'' was a half-witty genre parody. This one might be described as genre zombie-ism: the hysterical, brainless animation of dead clichיs reduced to purposeless, compulsive killing. Too self-serious to succeed as pastiche, it has no reason for being beyond the parasitic urge to feed on the memories of other, better movies.
And also, apparently, to give a cast of first-rate actors the chance to earn some money trying out funny voices and suppressing whatever sense of nuance they might possess. ''Gangster Squad'' would have been more fun as an animated feature, with fanciful animals in the principal roles. Instead of enduring Mr. Penn's quacking, duck-faced performance, we might have at least been able to enjoy Mickey Cohen imagined as an actual duck. The growly, jowly O'Mara is a natural canine, somewhere between McGruff and Offissa Pupp; Mr. Gosling and Ms. Stone would make a fine pair of purring kitty cats; and Nick Nolte's police commissioner is pure bullfrog.
''Gangster Squad'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Ridiculous violence and swaggering profanity.

Tough Path Seen By Obama on Ban Of Assault Arms

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR and PETER BAKER

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 1099 words

WASHINGTON -- While President Obama pledged to crack down on access to what he called ''weapons of war'' in the aftermath of last month's schoolhouse massacre, the White House has calculated that a ban on military-style assault weapons will be exceedingly difficult to pass through Congress and is focusing on other measures it deems more politically achievable.
As a task force led by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. readies recommendations on reducing gun violence for delivery to the president next week, White House officials say a new ban will be an element of whatever final package is proposed. But given the entrenched opposition from gun rights groups and their advocates on Capitol Hill, the White House is trying to avoid making its passage the sole definition of success and is emphasizing other new gun rules that could conceivably win bipartisan support and reduce gun deaths. 
During a day of White House meetings on the issue on Thursday, including one with the National Rifle Association, Mr. Biden focused publicly on universal background checks for gun purchases and the need for more federal research on gun violence. In 15 minutes of public remarks, Mr. Biden made no mention of curbing the production and sale of assault weapons, even though he was a prime author of such a law that passed in 1994 and expired 10 years later. Both he and the president say they strongly support an assault weapons ban.
But Mr. Biden noted that his former colleagues in the Senate have long been ''pretty universally opposed to any restrictions on gun ownership or what type of weapons can be purchased.'' He said they now seem more open to limits on the purchase of high-capacity magazines.
A spokesman for Mr. Obama said later in the afternoon that the vice president's remarks merely reflect a desire for a broad approach to gun violence.
''President Obama has been clear that Congress should reinstate the assault weapons ban and that avoiding this issue just because it's been politically difficult in the past is not an option,'' said Matt Lehrich, the spokesman. ''He's also stressed that no single piece of legislation alone can solve this problem, which is why he has asked Vice President Biden to explore a wide array of proposals on topics ranging from gun laws to mental health to school safety.''
The calculation on the assault weapons ban underscores the complicated politics of guns on Capitol Hill despite public outrage after a gunman killed 26 people, including 20 children, at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in December. While the shootings prompted some pro-gun lawmakers to endorse limits on assault weapons, Republicans who control the House Judiciary Committee still oppose such limits.
A statement by the N.R.A. after Thursday's meeting underscored the political challenges. The group accused the White House of having an ''agenda to attack the Second Amendment,'' and said it would go to the halls of Congress in its efforts to stop gun restrictions.
''We will now take our commitment and meaningful contributions to members of Congress of both parties who are interested in having an honest conversation about what works -- and what does not,'' the statement said.
The calibrated public focus by Mr. Biden also reflects a tension within the administration and Democratic circles, with some gun control advocates pressing for a robust effort on the assault weapon ban and others leery of being caught in a losing cause at the expense of other measures with more chances of success. While Mr. Biden has included Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., Janet Napolitano, the Homeland Security secretary, and other cabinet officials in his working group, officials said the process is being driven by the White House.
In addition to limits on high-capacity magazines and expanded background checks, Mr. Biden's group is looking at ways of keeping guns out of the hands of the mentally ill and cracking down on sales that are already illegal. One possibility is tougher laws against straw purchasing with longer prison terms for those who buy guns for others. Some officials would like to expand mandatory minimum sentences for gun law violations, but the White House in general does not like such sentences. Mr. Biden's group is also considering seeking additional money to enforce existing laws.
Mr. Biden's comment this week about taking executive action was seized on by some opponents as evidence that the president wanted to unilaterally restrict gun sales to legal buyers. But officials said executive action refers to limited measures like directing more attention and resources to pursuing violations of existing gun laws and studying gun violence.
The ammunition limit has drawn attention from Democrats in Congress, both because they think it might be easier to pass and because it might have more impact than an assault weapon ban. To pass the last assault weapon ban through a Democratic Congress more amenable to gun control, Mr. Biden had to accept compromises that allowed many guns to be sold.
The White House effort is coming even as some governors are seeking state legislation that would limit the availability of guns and ammunition. In Colorado, Gov. John W. Hickenlooper, a Democrat, called on Thursday for universal background checks on all gun sales in his state.
In New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has made gun control efforts a centerpiece of his next year in office, pledging to pass a tough new assault weapons ban in his state, limits on large-capacity magazines and measures to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill.
Mr. Obama's push for new federal action is the first serious one in many years. Mr. Biden held several meetings Thursday with representatives of hunting and wildlife groups, advocates of gun ownership, and officials with the entertainment industry. At the start of the meetings, Mr. Biden said he would give Mr. Obama his recommendations on Tuesday, though they may not be made public until later.
In their own closed-door meetings with the vice president on Wednesday, gun control advocates emphasized their belief that measures other than the assault weapons ban could be even more effective in preventing the kinds of recent massacres that have captured public and political attention, several participants said.
''There's a natural gravity that happens toward the ban in the wake of tragedies,'' said Dan Gross, the president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, who attended the meeting. ''But it's very important to point out that background checks could have an even bigger impact.''

1913 Museum of 'Fakes' Proposed
NEW YORK -- M. Jacques Seligmann, who left for France aboard the French liner Savoie yesterday [Jan. 9], outlined to a Herald correspondent a scheme for the education of American picture-buyers in order to assist them in preventing unscrupulous dealers from imposing fraudulent pictures upon them. He purposes founding in the New Galleries in New York, a ''museum of 'fakes','' in which will be shown examples of forgeries which have been represented to American collectors as ''Old Masters.'' ''Every time I come to this country,'' M. Seligmann said, ''I feel more strongly that it is my duty to protect buyers of works of art against forgeries and imitations.'' 
1938 Nation Awaits Royal Birth
AMSTERDAM -- A 240-gun salute may be fired outside Soestdijk Palace either Saturday [Jan. 15] or Sunday, informing the nation of the surprising news that Princess Juliana has given birth to twins. New instructions were given to army gunners over the weekend, ordering them to be ready to fire a 240-gun salute if necessary. Previously, they were instructed to fire 51 guns for the birth of a girl and 101 guns if a male heir to the House of Orange were born. Meanwhile, brokers on the Amsterdam exchange are reported to be offering odds of twenty to one for stakes as high as $1,000 that a boy will be born. Captain G.H. Steenhauer is now settled at the end of a special wire from the palace, ready to receive the news of a birth of twins or single child, and then relay it to the gunners scattered throughout the country.
1963 Crash on Mיtro Injures 37
PARIS -- A Mיtro train today [Jan. 10] rammed another train standing on the track, injuring 37 persons. Of 17 passengers taken to hospitals for treatment, all but one were released after receiving first aid. Service on the Porte de la Chapelle-Mairie d'lssy Mיtro line, running along a north-south axis, was interrupted for about five hours. It was the first serious accident on the Paris subway lines since 1931, when about 100 persons were injured in a similar crash. The accident occurred at midmorning near the Porte de Versailles station on the southwestern edge of Paris.

3 Kurds Slain in Paris, in Locked-Door Mystery

BYLINE: By DAN BILEFSKY and ALAN COWELL; Scott Sayare contributed reporting from Paris, and Sebnem Arsu from Istanbul.

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 1189 words

PARIS -- The three Kurdish women were murdered, two with bullets to the head, the third with a shot to the stomach. It was a carefully planned killing in a nondescript building in central Paris.
When the bodies were found early Thursday, the office was locked from the outside. Three bullet casings were found on the floor. Blood was splattered on the door.
One of the dead women was a founder of the Kurdistan Workers' Party -- or P.K.K. -- a Kurdish separatist group that has waged a guerrilla war against Turkey since 1984. The other two were Kurdish activists who may well have died because they were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.
There were competing theories over who was responsible, and outraged Kurds poured into the street in Paris, blaming Turkey. Officials there said the killings were probably a dispute among Kurds, perhaps intended to derail new peace talks between the government and the separatist group's jailed leader, or to settle a score. 
But these were theories. The evidence spoke only to a well-planned job.
''No hypothesis can be excluded at this stage'' about the motive, said Agnטs Thibault-Lecuivre, a spokeswoman for the Paris prosecutor's office. Visiting the crime scene on Thursday, Interior Minister Manuel Valls called the killings ''intolerable'' and said they were ''without doubt an execution.''
The shootings took place in the gritty 10th Arrondissement of the city, near the Gare du Nord railroad station, in a working-class immigrant neighborhood of Turkish kebab shops and African hair salons. The killings prompted outrage, raised fears of violent revenge and opened a new chapter in the often murky annals of Kurdish exile life.
The bodies were found around 2 a.m. inside the Kurdish Information Center on Rue La Fayette, which is used to promote Kurds' political and cultural agendas. Someone would have to have known the office was there -- there was no plaque outside. And the front door could be opened only with a digital code or if the occupants buzzed someone in, the manager of the center, Leon Edart, told reporters.
That possibility led to many questions. Did the women know their killer? Did the killer slip into the center behind a welcomed guest? An organization called the Federation of Kurdish Associations in France, representing many of the estimated 150,000 Kurdish exiles in the country, added to the intrigue, saying in a statement that the victims might have been killed with weapons equipped with silencers.
''Why anyone would want to do this is unclear,'' said Rusen Werdi, a lawyer at the Paris Kurdish Institute, which is near the information center on Rue La Fayette, and who knew two of the women. ''It was an ambush.''
The bodies, she said, were discovered after friends became concerned about the women because cellphone calls had gone unanswered and none of them had returned home.
Ms. Thibault-Lecuivre said the antiterrorism department of the prosecutor's office would oversee the investigation.
The authorities confirmed the identities of two of the victims: Leyla Soylemez, a young Kurdish activist, and Fidan Dogan, the head of the Kurdish Information Center and a representative of the Kurdistan National Congress. News media reports said the third woman was Sakine Cansiz, a founder of the Kurdistan Workers' Party.
But for all the mystery, Ms. Werdi said, it appeared that the target was Ms. Cansiz and that the other two victims might well have been killed because they were with her.
Ms. Werdi said that at least one of the women, Ms. Cansiz, had been under surveillance by the French police because of her activism. She said that Ms. Cansiz had been keeping a low profile in recent months, and that it was rare for her to be at the information center.
The Kurdish separatist group is no stranger to infighting and internal strife. Hurriyet, a Turkish daily newspaper, said Ms. Cansiz was ''known for her opposition to the alleged head of the P.K.K.'s armed wing, Syrian citizen Ferman Hussein.'' But Kurdish activists said she was very close to Abdullah Ocalan, the head of the P.K.K., who has been in prison since 1999 in Turkey.
Ms. Cansiz had been in Paris since 2007, after the authorities in Germany arrested and briefly held her before rejecting Turkey's request for her extradition. She also was imprisoned in Turkey in 1979 and freed in 1991 for her activism, after which she became involved in the separatist group, fellow activists said. She played a leading role in garnering financial and political support for the Kurdish cause in Europe.
Dorothיe Schmid, an expert on Turkey at the French Institute of International Relations in Paris, did not rule out the possibility that the killings could have been the work of extreme Turkish nationalists, some of whom are virulently opposed to negotiations that would lead to Turkey's granting Kurds further rights and autonomy. Turkish analysts and officials have long talked of a ''deep state'' in Turkey, a group of operatives, linked to the military, who are thought to have battled their perceived enemies since the end of the cold war.
The P.K.K. has been fighting the Turkish authorities for almost three decades to demand greater autonomy. The conflict, in which an estimated 40,000 people have been killed, is fueled by competing notions of national identity that are rooted in the founding of modern Turkey on the ruins of the Ottoman Empire by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk in 1923. Kurds account for about 15 million of Turkey's 74 million people.
Turkey, the United States and the European Union have labeled the group a terrorist organization, but sympathy for it and its goals remains widespread in many towns in Turkey's rugged southeast.
Huseyin Celik, the deputy chairman of the governing party in Turkey, the Justice and Development Party said: ''Whenever in Turkey we reach the stage of saying, 'Friend, give up this business, let the weapons be silent,' whenever a determination emerges on this, such incidents happen. Is there one P.K.K.? I'm not sure of that.''
Restive Kurdish minorities live in a broad region that includes Turkey, Syria, Iraq, Iran and parts of the former Soviet Union. Regional turmoil in recent years has emboldened Kurdish separatists, inspired by the example of Iraqi Kurds who control an autonomous zone. Turkey fears that the civil war in neighboring Syria may strengthen the separatist yearnings of Kurds there.
In recent years, Turkey has sought to clamp down on Kurdish activists outside of the country, including in France, Germany, Belgium and Denmark, where Kurds have established sizable communities as well as civic groups and media outlets that Kurdish officials say are a refuge from Turkish censorship. Turkey has accused some of the groups of being fronts for separatists or terrorists.
In Paris, the mood was angry and somber as hundreds of Kurds filled the street outside the building where the bodies were found. Some people waved Kurdish flags while others chanted, ''We are all P.K.K.!'' On Thursday evening a single police officer stood guard outside the information center's office. Six roses, five red and one white, were laid against the door.

New York Legislators Debate Details of Gun Law

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM and THOMAS KAPLAN

ALBANY -- Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and lawmakers have agreed they want to ban military-style weapons and high-capacity magazines, but continue to negotiate over the fine print of a broad gun-control package that would include such a ban, state officials said Thursday.
There was cautious optimism on all sides that a deal could be reached next week. The package would include key measures the governor laid out in his annual State of the State address on Wednesday, including a more restrictive assault weapons ban than currently exists in New York, background checks for the private sales of guns, tougher penalties for buying guns illegally or using them to commit crimes, and uniform licensing standards across the state. 
Coupled with the gun measures would be an expansion of Kendra's Law, which allows a judge to force mentally ill patients to be committed or to receive treatment if they pose a danger to themselves or to others. The law was named for Kendra Webdale, who was pushed to her death on a subway platform in 1999 by a schizophrenic patient. It is set to expire in 2015, and lawmakers have not agreed on whether to extend the law.
The gun-law package is also expected to include new reporting requirements for psychiatrists and other mental health professionals, requiring them to disclose when they learn that patients pose a serious danger to themselves or to others in order to make it easier to restrict gun sales to such individuals.
It was unclear, however, whether the governor would be able to get an agreement on a key provision he has pushed for: reducing the permissible capacity of detachable ammunition magazines to 7 bullets from 10, a limitation that would be the most restrictive in the nation.
On Thursday, Mr. Cuomo again made it clear that, since the school massacre in Newtown, Conn., and the shooting deaths of two firefighters in Webster, N.Y., last month, he has become exasperated and impatient over the issue of gun violence, and wants the Legislature to act swiftly.
''A majority of the people of this state are saying enough is enough,'' Mr. Cuomo said. ''Something has to be done. How many lives have to be lost? How many innocents have to be lost?''
Legislative leaders have indicated a deal is not far off. Dean G. Skelos, leader of the Senate Republicans, said this week, ''I think we can wrap it up pretty quickly.'' He added, ''We'll try to get something done by the end of this week, present at the conference next week and we'll see where we go.''
Sheldon Silver, a Democrat and the speaker of the Assembly, has said negotiators are ''95 percent'' of the way to an agreement.
After fits and starts in the negotiations over the past couple of weeks, Republicans appear to be ready to accommodate the governor.
''Like many of my colleagues, I believe very strongly in Second Amendment rights and protecting the rights of sportsmen, but I also understand that nobody needs an Army- or a Soviet-type weapon to go hunting with,'' said Senator Thomas W. Libous, a Binghamton Republican who is the deputy leader of the Republican caucus, and who shoots clay targets with his shotgun. ''But we do need to go after criminals who commit crimes with guns and with illegal guns; we need to tighten up Kendra's Law to protect those with mental illness who have access to guns.''
Albany's changing political dynamic is also a factor in the talks. As a result of last year's election, the new Legislature sworn in this week includes an Assembly controlled by Democrats and a Senate that for the first time is led by a coalition of Republicans and a small group of breakaway Democrats.
Senator Jeffery D. Klein of the Bronx, who leads the independent Democratic faction, has supported more gun control, and he said, ''I think we can get this legislation done.''
''Early next week is a reasonable goal, but the most important thing is we get this done right,'' he added. ''We're looking at four major points: a stricter definition of assault weapons and the ban, stricter limitations on gun magazines sizes, tougher penalties for illegal gun possession and -- this is a piece I initiated -- better screening for mental health problems on the front and back end. I believe they will all be in there.''
Mr. Cuomo said he was open to making changes in his gun-control package based on feedback from lawmakers, but did not specify where he was willing to compromise.
The governor also said there was a disagreement over what to do with assault weapons that are now legally owned but would become illegal under an expanded ban; last month, he said ''confiscation could be an option,'' a remark that set off anxiety among gun owners, but has not repeated the comment recently and appears to have backed off from it.
Mr. Cuomo acknowledged that legislators were likely to face pressure from gun-rights groups not to pass his proposals, but he said that lawmakers had an obligation to their constituents to support legislation that would improve public safety.
''Yes, you will annoy some extremists,'' he said, ''but you will protect the people of your district, and the people of this state.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

'Lincoln' Leads In the Battle For Oscars

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CIEPLY and BROOKS BARNES

SECTION: Section C; Column 0; Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk; Pg. 1

LOS ANGELES
TORTURE. Terror. Mental illness. Revolt. Where's Uggie the dog when you need him?
The 85th Academy Awards season jolted into place on Thursday as the heaviest number of Oscar nominations -- including nods for best picture -- went to ''Lincoln,'' about a president's struggle with the Civil War; ''Life of Pi,'' about a shipwreck survivor and a tiger; ''Silver Linings Playbook,'' a comedy, of sorts, about a man with bipolar disorder; and ''Les Misיrables,'' filled with songs of the oppressed.
Close behind were ''Argo,'' about political captivity; ''Amour,'' a French-language film about aging and dying; and ''Django Unchained,'' a tale of slavery and retribution.
''Beasts of the Southern Wild,'' which chronicles a child's encounters with rising floodwaters in the bayou, and ''Zero Dark Thirty,'' about the murky pursuit of a national enemy, also received best picture nominations. 
But the shocker was a triple snub in the best director category: Kathryn Bigelow (''Zero Dark Thirty''), Ben Affleck (''Argo'') and Quentin Tarantino (''Django Unchained'') were passed over despite widespread expectations that one or all of them would be nominated. Instead, the nominations went to Steven Spielberg (''Lincoln''), Ang Lee (''Life of Pi''), Michael Haneke (''Amour''), David O. Russell (''Silver Linings Playbook'') and Benh Zeitlin (''Beasts of the Southern Wild,'' his first film).
''We didn't destroy the hotel room too badly, but it was definitely a blind celebratory panic that we went into,'' Mr. Zeitlin said in a telephone interview.
In all, nine films received best picture nominations in a field that can include as many as 10 or as few as 5, depending on how voters from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences spread their hand.
Mr. Spielberg's ''Lincoln'' was considered the picture to beat, and it led the field with 12 nominations. It remains to be seen, however, if ''Lincoln'' will end up more like ''The Artist,'' which last year established dominance (with help from its cheery Jack Russell terrier co-star, Uggie) and won best picture, or Mr. Spielberg's own ''Saving Private Ryan,'' which seemed to lead through much of the 1999 awards season but lost out to ''Shakespeare in Love.''
The nominations were announced at the Academy's Beverly Hills headquarters in an early-morning ceremony that paired the actress Emma Stone with the host of this year's Oscar telecast, Seth MacFarlane. The unusual inclusion of Mr. MacFarlane, creator of the animated television show ''Family Guy,'' was an effort by the Academy to increase his public profile. Only once before (in 1972, when Charlton Heston did it) has a host announced nominees.
Mr. MacFarlane worked hard to squelch skepticism about his selection as host and to hint at what will come on Oscar night, cracking a series of one-liners that mocked the self-seriousness of the Oscars and the craft of moviemaking. The directing nominees, he said, are ''the very best at sitting in a chair and watching other people make a movie.'' Of the foreign film ''Amour,'' he said, ''The last time Austria and Germany got together and co-produced something, it was Hitler.'' (Cue nervous laughter from the 400 or so reporters in the room.)
Hollywood faces a somewhat longer than usual campaign period. A new digital voting system -- despite its reported hitches -- allowed the Academy to announce nominees two weeks earlier than it did last year, and more than six weeks before the awards ceremony, which ABC will broadcast on Feb. 24.
''Lincoln'' was followed closely in the balloting by ''Life of Pi,'' which surpassed expectations by coming up second with 11 nominations, even as ''Zero Dark Thirty,'' an early favorite, fell into the pack, with just 5.
Mr. Spielberg's directing nomination was his seventh, while Daniel Day-Lewis received his fifth best actor nomination, this time for his portrayal of Lincoln. (He has won twice.) Sally Field was among the ''Lincoln'' nominees, as a supporting actress for playing Mary Todd Lincoln, as was Tony Kushner, for writing the film's adapted script.
All of that, as well as an aggressive promotional campaign that found the film playing as a civics lesson of a sort when it was screened for the United States Senate, has helped create a sense that ''Lincoln'' is the most important picture in a self-consciously important field.
''You never ever know how these things are going to go, so it's really gratifying,'' said Kathleen Kennedy, a producer of ''Lincoln,'' who spoke by telephone on Thursday morning. She noted, however, that it was not a perfect day for the ''Lincoln'' team. ''I was very disappointed that our makeup and hair people weren't recognized,'' she said.
Though no slouch when it comes to importance, ''Zero Dark Thirty,'' about the pursuit of Osama bin Laden, may have been hurt by controversy, as several senators and a number of political critics tore into the film for the way it portrayed torture.
But Oscar voters gave the film a nomination for Mark Boal's screenplay and nominated its star, Jessica Chastain, for best actress.
All of the year's best actress nominees hailed from movies that have yet to find a broad audience. (''Zero Dark Thirty'' did not have widespread release until this weekend.) Along with Ms. Chastain the nominees in that category are Jennifer Lawrence (''Silver Linings Playbook''), Emmanuelle Riva (''Amour''), Naomi Watts (''The Impossible'') and Quvenzhanי Wallis (''Beasts of the Southern Wild''), at age 9 the youngest best actress nominee ever.
Joining Mr. Day-Lewis in the running for best actor are Bradley Cooper (''Silver Linings Playbook''), Joaquin Phoenix (''The Master''), Hugh Jackman (''Les Misיrables'') and Denzel Washington (''Flight'').
Among the clear winners on Thursday was Walt Disney Studios, which had three of the five nominees in the category for best animated feature: ''Brave,'' ''Frankenweenie'' and ''Wreck-It Ralph.'' The rival DreamWorks Animation had none. ''The Pirates! Band of Misfits,'' released by Sony Pictures, and ''ParaNorman,'' from Focus Features, were the other animation nominees.
''Silver Linings Playbook,'' from the Weinstein Company, also came up a winner, as seven of its eight nominations came in prominent categories. Robert De Niro was nominated for best supporting actor and Jacki Weaver for best supporting actress. The film was the first to be nominated in all four acting categories since ''Reds,'' released in 1981, according to Libby Wertin, a researcher with the Academy. It slightly outstripped ''Lincoln'' in the major categories, and handily surpassed ''Life of Pi,'' which had no acting nominees.
In keeping with recent tradition the Academy brushed off the best box-office performers. There were no nominations in acting or directing categories for ''The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,'' ''The Dark Knight Rises'' or ''Skyfall.''
The Oscar process has been especially rough this year, as the Academy began phasing out paper ballots in favor of online voting. The idea was to get quicker results, which allowed the group to break precedent by announcing its nominations before the presentation ceremony of the rival Golden Globes, set for Sunday.
But some of the Academy's roughly 6,000 potential voters remained unaware of the shift until balloting was near. Others had trouble accessing a heavily secured voting system. The Oscar nominating vote was ultimately extended by a day, after the documentary branch members got an extension for voting on their shortlist, which was selected under new rules.
The new documentary process, intended to broaden the pool of voters making a first cut of the candidates, yielded what appeared to be a fairly conventional list of culturally hip or politically progressive nominees. Those were ''5 Broken Cameras,'' about Palestinian resistance to the Israeli Army; ''The Gatekeepers,'' about the Israeli security apparatus; ''How to Survive a Plague,'' about AIDS; ''The Invisible War,'' which deals with rape in the United States military; and ''Searching for Sugar Man,'' about the lost career of the singer Rodriguez.
Tom Hooper was bypassed as the director of ''Les Misיrables,'' from Universal. But the film received eight nominations overall, and its presumed strength among actors -- Anne Hathaway was nominated for best supporting actress, along with Mr. Jackman's best actor nomination -- still make it a force to be reckoned with.
On ABC's Oscar telecast ''Skyfall'' will presumably be part of a special retrospective on the 50-year-old James Bond franchise. Any other year a Bond montage might be a routine bid for the pop audience. But after the mass killings in Newtown, Conn., and Aurora, Colo., and with Hollywood receiving criticism for its reliance on showy violence, the tribute may pose a challenge for the event's producers, Neil Meron and Craig Zadan, who will have to decide whether to serve up their killer-spy with or without his guns blazing.
The Academy has fought a perennial battle to win younger viewers and to maintain the ratings for its telecast, even as its voters have leaned toward smaller films and sober fare.
For Mr. MacFarlane, who was nominated as writer of the lyrics for ''Everybody Needs a Best Friend,'' from ''Ted,'' the biggest challenge may be the need to wring laughs out of so many serious pictures.
But he is trying.
''If you don't know who I am, just pretend I'm Donny Osmond,'' he said, getting mileage from a crack about his own baby face. ''We'll get along fine.''

Blasts in Pakistan Kill Scores and Stir Fears on Elections

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- Bomb blasts in two Pakistani cities killed at least 115 people on Thursday and wounded more than 270, offering harrowing evidence of how the country's myriad internal conflicts could destabilize it as elections approach.
The worst violence occurred in the southwestern city of Quetta, where two explosions a few minutes apart in the evening ripped through a snooker hall in a neighborhood dominated by ethnic Hazara Shiites, killing at least 81 people and wounding more than 170, the police said. 
A suicide bomber detonated his explosives inside the hall, and a second attacker then blew up his vehicle outside the club as police officers and journalists arrived, a senior police officer, Mir Zubair Mehmood, told reporters. Five police officers and one camera operator were killed in the second explosion. Hospitals were overwhelmed as casualties arrived through the evening.
Hazara leaders said it was the worst sectarian attack in Quetta since attacks on their community started about 14 years ago.
Quetta is no stranger to sectarian, nationalist or Islamist violence. Most violence against Shiites there has been directed by Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, a Sunni militant group with strong ties to the Pakistani Taliban, which claimed responsibility for the snooker hall attack. Snooker is a variation of billiards.
An ethnic Baluch separatist group claimed responsibility for another bombing earlier on Thursday, aimed at paramilitary soldiers in a commercial part of Quetta, which killed 12 people.
The Hazara, minority Shiites who migrated from Afghanistan more than a century ago, have been the target of dozens of attacks from sectarian death squads led by Lashkar-e-Jhangvi in Quetta over the past year, but the snooker hall bombing was by far the bloodiest.
Human rights activists said the police and the security forces failed to protect the vulnerable community. ''The callousness and indifference of the authorities offers a damning indictment of the state, its military and security agencies,'' said Ali Dayan Hasan, the Pakistan director at Human Rights Watch.
The other focus of violence on Thursday was the Swat Valley, in northwestern Pakistan, where an explosion at a religious seminary killed at least 22 people and wounded an additional 60. It was not clear why the seminary, run by the Islamic missionary group Tablighi Jamaat, was a target.
Initial reports said a gas leak had caused the explosion, but police and hospital officials later said that there was clear evidence of a bomb.
Doctors at a hospital in Saidu Sharif, near the site, said blast victims were being treated for wounds caused by ball bearings, which are sometimes packed into suicide bombs to make them more deadly.
''There was a smell of explosives,'' Muhammad Iqbal, a senior doctor, said by telephone.
Islamist violence in Swat drew international condemnation in October after Taliban gunmen shot a teenage girl and education activist, Malala Yousafzai. The episode highlighted how Islamist fighters were slowly returning to the valley three years after a Pakistani military operation drove them away.
The violence underscores the fragility of state authority in parts of Pakistan as the country prepares for a general election that is scheduled to take place before June. Many Pakistanis worry that instability could cause the elections to be postponed.
Frustration about the violence among the Pakistani public has been stoked by anger toward the United States, which continued to press its campaign of drone strikes against militant targets in the tribal belt on Thursday.
A C.I.A.-directed missile strike on a compound in North Waziristan killed five people, Pakistani officials said. It was the seventh such attack in two weeks.

Gun Enthusiast With Popular Online Videos Is Shot to Death in Georgia

BYLINE: By ROBBIE BROWN; Dan Barry contributed reporting from New York.

CARNESVILLE, Ga. -- Keith Ratliff loved guns. He built his own rifles. He kept bullets in his car's cup holder. And on the rear window he slapped a sticker of the Starbucks Coffee mermaid firing two pistols.
''I love Guns and Coffee,'' it read. 
Mr. Ratliff's passion for firearms made him something of a celebrity on the Internet, where he helped make scores of videos about high-powered and exotic guns and explosives. His YouTube channel, called FPSRussia, became the site's ninth largest, with nearly 3.5 million subscribers and more than 500 million views.
But last week, the authorities said, Mr. Ratliff, 32, ended up on the wrong end of a gun. The police in northeast Georgia found him dead at his office on Jan. 3, shot once in the head. He was surrounded by several guns, but not the one that killed him. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation is treating it as a homicide.
''We are interviewing people of interest, but we have not named a suspect,'' said the Franklin County sheriff, Stevie Thomas. ''We are not ruling out any options.''
The news, coming amid a national debate about gun control, rippled across the blogs and social networking sites where his videos were popular. Tributes on Facebook and Twitter came from fans stunned that such a well-armed expert had not been able to defend himself.
''For him not to pull out that gun and try to defend himself, he had to feel comfortable around somebody,'' his brother, Kelly Ratliff, told a television channel in Lexington, Ky., where he used to live. ''Either that or he was ambushed.''
Mr. Ratliff's videos, which starred a friend, Kyle Myers, are popular for their homegrown brand of zaniness -- three minutes of Mr. Myers's casual banter as he rakes targets or blows things up with extreme displays of firepower. Most are made outdoors, where Mr. Myers fires at targets like hay bales or photographs of Justin Bieber, while explaining the merits of various weapons. The videos always end the same way: with a boom.
''We couldn't make a video about such a high-powered rifle without blowing up a truck,'' Mr. Myers says in one video before opening fire on an empty pickup truck. ''So let's get a nice, big explosion and maybe a little shrapnel.''
F.P.S. is slang among video game players for ''first-person shooter.'' ''Russia'' refers to the thick accent used by Mr. Myers's online persona.
Mr. Ratliff recently moved from Kentucky to Carnesville, a city of 540 people that is 80 miles from Atlanta. He opened a business that made and repaired firearms, and was licensed by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the authorities said.
He was last seen alive at 7 p.m. on Jan. 2, the police said. The next night, the police found him dead inside the business, FPS Industries.
Neighbors in this small community said Mr. Ratliff kept to himself. His wife and 2-year-old son lived in Kentucky. Until last week, Sheriff Thomas said he was called to the property only once, after neighbors heard gunfire.
''As many of you already know I lost a close friend this week,'' Mr. Myers wrote to his 1.1 million Facebook followers. ''I ask only that you show respect to the situation for the family's sake.''

LOS ANGELES -- One student was shot at a California high school Thursday morning and another student was taken into custody, according to law enforcement officials. 
Around 9, the Kern County Sheriff's Office received calls about a gunman on campus at Taft Union High School, in a rural area of the state about 120 miles north of Los Angeles.
One student, a male, was shot in the chest area and airlifted to the hospital in Bakersfield, according to Ray Pruitt, a spokesman for the sheriff's office.
Another male student was taken into custody, and a shotgun was found at the scene, Mr. Puritt said. No more information about the victim's condition was immediately available.
Initially, the sheriff's office said two students had been shot. But Mr. Pruitt said officials now believed the second student was not hit by gunfire but had a ''stress-related reaction to the shooting.''

Previews and Openings
'Bethany' (previews start on Friday; opens on Jan. 20) Playing a resident of a depressed American exurb blighted by foreclosures, America Ferrera leaves behind the glitzy fashion and media world she inhabited on ''Ugly Betty'' in this dark comedy by Laura Marks. Gaye Taylor Upchurch directs the world premiere, which kicks off the 35th season of the Women's Project in its new Midtown home. City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (David Rooney) 
'Cat on a Hot Tin Roof' (in previews; opens on Thursday) Break out the bourbon. Since Barbara Bel Geddes first prowled the Pollitt family's Mississippi Delta plantation home in 1955, Tennessee Williams's sultry drama of Southern decadence, greed and mendacity has returned to Broadway in five major productions -- this one being its third in a decade. The latest actress to don Maggie the Cat's figure-hugging slip and indomitable determination is Scarlett Johansson, who won a Tony Award in 2010 for her Broadway debut in ''A View From the Bridge.'' Appearing alongside her in this Rob Ashford production is Benjamin Walker (''Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson'') as Maggie's boozing, depressed husband, Brick, with Ciaran Hinds as Big Daddy and Debra Monk as Big Mama. Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Rooney)
'Clive' (previews start on Thursday; opens on Feb. 7) After directing Jonathan Marc Sherman's ''Things We Want'' for the New Group, Ethan Hawke reunites with that playwright and company to stage this world premiere inspired by Bertolt Brecht's ''Baal.'' Mr. Hawke also plays the title character in this modern update, which traces the slide from success to self-destruction of a songwriter in 1990s New York. Brooks Ashmanskas, Vincent D'Onofrio and Zoe Kazan also star in the production, which features live performances of classic American songs. Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Collision' (in previews; opens on Jan. 22) The prolific no-rules New York theater troupe the Amoralists return with this drama written by Lyle Kessler and directed by David Fofi.

'Hamlet in Bed' (previews start on Thursday; opens on Feb. 3) Michael Laurence had a hit at SoHo Playhouse in 2009 with his solo show ''Krapp, 39.'' Scaling up to a two-hander with this darkly comic reflection on mothers and sons, he appears as an actor gripped by the parallel obsessions of finding his birth mother and tackling Shakespeare's despondent Dane. Lisa Emery plays the woman he enlists to fill the roles of parent and queen in this production from the Obie winner Lisa Peterson (''An Iliad''). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (866) 811-4111, sohoplayhouse.com. (Rooney)
'In Acting Shakespeare' (in previews; opens on Sunday) James DeVita wrote and performs this personalized adaptation of a 1987 one-man show by Ian McKellen that planted his desire to become an actor. Dipping into Shakespeare's life and poetry, the solo piece reflects on Mr. DeVita's journey from being a directionless Long Island fisherman to a classical actor, serving for the past 17 years as a core company member and literary manager of American Players Theater in Spring Green, Wis. Pearl Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 563-9261, pearltheatre.org. (Rooney)
'The Jammer' (in previews; opens on Jan. 22) Fresh out of the Yale School of Drama, Rolin Jones turned heads at the Atlantic in 2005 with his play ''The Intelligent Design of Jenny Chow.'' After several years devoted to his busy television writing career (''Weeds,'' ''Friday Night Lights,'' ''Boardwalk Empire''), Mr. Jones returns to the stage with this contemporary urban fable set in the hard-boiled world of professional roller derby in 1950s New York. Jackson Gay directs a nine-member cast led by Patch Darragh. Atlantic Stage 2, 330 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Rooney)
'Life and Times: Episodes 1-4' (opens on Wednesday) Theatergoers looking to settle in for a full day's experience will gravitate toward this Soho Rep production of Nature Theater of Oklahoma's latest experiment, which continues its run at the Public after making its debut as part of the Under the Radar Festival and can be seen in installments or back to back. ''Epic stories need epic forms.'' That company statement encapsulates the thinking behind this 11-hour journey from earliest memory through adolescence. Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org, undertheradarfestival.com. (Rooney)
'Midsummer (A Play With Songs)' (in previews; opens on Tuesday) This lo-fi musical romantic comedy, written and directed by David Greig with songs by Gordon McIntyre, comes from the Traverse Theater, one of Scotland's most fertile incubators of original stage work. Winner of the 2012 Best of Edinburgh Award, the show follows the mismatched lovers Bob and Helena through an eventful lost weekend that prompted a critic for the Guardian to write, ''You float out laughing as if you've just swallowed sunshine on a spoon.'' Clurman Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Not by Bread Alone' (opens on Wednesday) The famed Nalaga'at Center of Tel Aviv houses the world's only professional deaf-blind acting company, as well as the BlackOut Restaurant, which operates in darkness with a blind wait staff, and Cafי Kapish, a sign language-only eatery with deaf servers. That environment is recreated in this immersive theater experience, which invites the audience to navigate the world exclusively through touch, taste and smell. Lest that prospect sound unappetizing, the menu is being conceived and prepared by Danny Meyer's Union Square Events. NYU Skirball Center, 566 La Guardia Place, at Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, (212) 352-3101, nyuskirball.org. (Rooney)
'Opus No. 7' (in previews; opens on Sunday) Famed for his groundbreaking non-narrative ''theater of painters'' spectacles, the Russian designer-director Dimitry Krymov stages these two one-acts that pay tribute to the victims of totalitarianism. Playing for eight performances only, the production features a multigenre original score performed live onstage, with larger-than-life puppets, dancing pianos, acrobats and a ''living wall'' that erupts with imagery. St. Ann's Warehouse, 29 Jay Street, at Plymouth Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (718) 254-8779, stannswarehouse.org. (Rooney)
'Picnic' (in previews; opens on Sunday) Despite being a Pulitzer Prize winner (in 1954) and possibly William Inge's best-known play, ''Picnic'' has only been revived one other time on Broadway, when the Roundabout presented Kyle Chandler and Ashley Judd as the young lovers in 1994. The Roundabout is once again revisiting it; this time the ubiquitous director Sam Gold (''Seminar,'' ''Circle Mirror Transformation'') has surrounded his young leads, Maggie Grace and Sebastian Stan, with a canny blend of theater mainstays (Reed Birney, Elizabeth Marvel) and Hollywood royalty (Ellen Burstyn). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Eric Grode)
'The Suit' (opens on Thursday) Returning to the Brooklyn Academy of Music, Peter Brook teams with his regular collaborator, Marie-Hיlטne Estienne, and the composer Franck Krawczyk on this version of Can Themba's tale of adultery, retribution and tragedy in 1950s South Africa under apartheid. Retold using Mr. Brook's trademark minimalist aesthetic, the work was adapted for the stage by Mothobi Mutloatse and Barney Simon. Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org. (Rooney)
'When It Rains' (in previews; opens on Friday) From the 2b Theater Company of Halifax, Nova Scotia, comes this live-action existential graphic novel written and directed by Anthony Black, whose work ''Invisible Atom'' was seen in the 2010 Under the Radar Festival. This experiment in theatrical storytelling starts with a reflection on the biblical tale of Job, branching out to ponder questions of happiness and unhappiness by considering to what extent we are responsible for our own misfortunes. La MaMa Ellen Stewart Theater, 66 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710, lamama.org. (Rooney)
'Working on a Special Day' (in previews; opens on Wednesday) The Play Company presents this piece inspired by Ettore Scola's 1977 Italian film, ''Una Giornata Particolare,'' which starred Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni. Developed in collaboration with Por Piedad Teatro of Mexico, the play uses minimal props to chronicle the instant bond that develops between a Roman housewife and her homosexual radio broadcaster neighbor on the day in 1938 of Hitler's visit to Mussolini's Italy. 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200, 59e59.org, playco.org.

Broadway
'Annie' James Lapine's revival of the singing comic strip from 1977 is merely serviceable. But its smiley-faced mixture of hope and corn scratches an itch in a city recovering from a recession and a hurricane. Theatergoers may feel the urge both to mist up and throw up, but Lilla Crawford is a nigh irresistible Orphan Annie. With Katie Finneran and Anthony Warlow (2:25). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Ben Brantley)
'Evita' This just in: Eva Perףn is still dead. That, anyway, is on the evidence of Michael Grandage's unsmiling revival of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice's 1978 bio-musical, which feels about as warm-blooded as a gilded mummy. Elena Roger, Michael Cerveris and Ricky Martin are the stars of this earnest combination of requiem mass and history pageant (2:30). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, Manhattan, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
'Glengarry Glen Ross' The fight has gone out of the boys from David Mamet's 1984 Pulitzer Prize-winning drama of sharks in a small pond. In Daniel Sullivan's deflated production, which stars an extravagantly gesturing Al Pacino, it's as if all the competitive fierceness has been sucked from them by some cosmic super-vacuum cleaner. It also stars Bobby Cannavale as the hotshot Ricky Roma (1:40). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Golden Boy' Bartlett Sher directs a superbly cast revival of Clifford Odets's 1937 drama about a young man (Seth Numrich) torn between a career as a boxer and his first love, the violin. It's a richly atmospheric production that cuts to the emotional quick of Odets's still-vital play (2:45). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Charles Isherwood)
'The Heiress' Masterpiece Theater on Broadway. Moisיs Kaufman's revival of Ruth and Augustus Goetz's sturdy war horse, starring a one-note Jessica Chastain, is lovely to look at, easy to follow -- and aside from a vivid supporting performance from Judith Ivey -- about as full of real life as an Olde New York Christmas window in a department store (2:45). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'The Mystery of Edwin Drood' A boisterous, well-cast revival of Rupert Holmes's Tony-winning 1986 musical, which gives the audience the chance to choose the identity of the killer of the titular hero. Chita Rivera lends an air of authentic glamour, Jim Norton is a cutup as the music-hall proprietor, and the young cast sings the lovely score with great skill (2:35). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Isherwood)
'Newsies' This Disney musical -- adapted from the 1992 movie and inspired by the newsboy strike of 1899 -- markets Urchin Appeal with extra! extra! enthusiasm. Jeff Calhoun directs a cast of comely, if overgrown, ragamuffins. The largely interchangeable songs are by Alan Menken and Jack Feldman (2:20). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (866) 870-2717, newsiesthemusical.com. (Brantley)
'Nice Work if You Can Get It' Every now and then a bubble of pure, tickling charm rises from the artificial froth of this pastiche 1920s musical, directed by Kathleen Marshall and featuring songs by George and Ira Gershwin. But mostly the production, starring Matthew Broderick and Kelli O'Hara, registers as a shiny, dutiful trickle of gags and production numbers (2:30). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Once' This gentle musical, set in Dublin, about a love affair that never quite happens -- based on the 2006 movie -- inventively uses songs (by Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova) and dance to convey a beautiful shimmer of might-have-been regret. Staged by John Tiffany and Steven Hoggett (''Black Watch''), the production stars the immensely appealing Steve Kazee and Cristin Milioti (2:15). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Peter and the Starcatcher' The most exhilarating and inventive example of story theater since the Royal Shakespeare Company's ''Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby.'' This production, about the boy who became Peter Pan, is an enchanted anatomy of the urge to defy gravity. Roger Rees and Alex Timbers direct (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' Pam MacKinnon's shattering 50th-anniversary revival of Edward Albee's hair-raising drama of marital discord stars an electrifying Tracy Letts (of ''August: Osage County'' fame) as George and Amy Morton (ditto) as Martha, ably supported by Carrie Coon and Madison Dirks as the young couple they use as cannon fodder. Not to be missed (3:05). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
Off Broadway
'Bare' Stafford Arima directs this tragic tale of star-cross'd gay lovers in a Roman Catholic boarding school. While the boys try to keep their romance secret, the truth comes spilling out during a school production of ''Romeo and Juliet.'' Retooled significantly since its first incarnation in 2000, this emo musical has been updated to reflect attitudes toward homophobia and bullying in the ''It Gets Better'' era. But despite touching moments and a committed cast, the material is too painfully earnest and riddled with clichיs to connect with audiences not still mired in adolescence (2:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, baremusicalnyc.com. (Rooney)
'Cougar the Musical' Three older women find themselves attracted to younger men, two against their better judgment. The concept seems made for bus tours, but imagination, appealing numbers with original melodies and theme-transcending jokes lift this show well above the level of ''Menopause: The Musical'' and its ilk (1:30). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Anita Gates)
'5 Lesbians Eating a Quiche' This frolicsome play, about a women's club in 1956, ventures into such heady excesses of absurdism, it deserves to be called Mama-ist. (Dada wouldn't do at all.) As written by Evan Linder and Andrew Hobgood, with Sarah Gitenstein directing, ''Quiche'' takes a giant leap from punning smirkiness into the outer space of nonsense (1:15). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Van Dam Street, South Village, sohoplayhouse.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Forbidden Broadway: Alive and Kicking' Gerard Alessandrini's essential satirical cheat sheet to Broadway musicals returns after a three-year absence, packing polished brass knuckles. A precisionist cast of four provides vocal cartoons as evocative as Al Hirschfeld's caricatures. This show not only tickles but also pierces the Achilles' heels of the productions under scrutiny (1:40). At the 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Forever Dusty' If Kristen Holly Smith turned up to your costume party in Dusty Springfield drag and started singing, there would be no mistaking the woman she was channeling. But doing a passable impersonation is a far cry from capturing the essence of one of the most distinctive female vocalists of all time, as this amateurish inflated cabaret act demonstrates. Written in by-the-numbers basics by Ms. Smith and Jonathan Vankin, and directed with minimal finesse by Randal Myler, this misconceived bio-musical is a soulless tribute to the platinum-haired, panda-eyed queen of white soul. She deserves better (1:40). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, foreverdusty.net. (Rooney)
&#x2605; 'The Freedom of the City' The masterful contemporary Irish dramatist Brian Friel puts a human face on the Troubles in Northern Ireland with this stirring drama from 1973 about the shooting by British soldiers of three nonviolent civilian protesters at a march, which echoes the tragic events of Bloody Sunday the year before. Staged by Ciaran O'Reilly with a firm handle on the narrative's time-shuffling structure and a stinging clarity that illuminates the play's multiple perspectives, this drama steadily tightens its grip, from its absorbing beginnings through to its shattering conclusion. The standout among the generally solid cast is Cara Seymour as a stubbornly optimistic housewife and mother of 11 children, living in two rooms with a useless husband and no running water (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737, irishrep.org. (Rooney)
&#x2605; 'Fried Chicken and Latkes' Rain Pryor, the daughter of the comedian Richard Pryor (who died in 2005), stars in this effervescent solo show, which recounts her upbringing in a biracial household (her mother is Jewish) in Beverly Hills, Calif. Ms. Pryor, who sings and portrays a range of characters (including, poignantly, her father in a spot on impression) is an ebullient performer with a robust singing voice. She lives in Baltimore now, but her outsize personality is built for Broadway (1:30). Actor's Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Andy Webster)
'Job' The professionally confrontational Thomas Bradshaw (''Burning'') revisits the Old Testament's most famously afflicted figure in this short, sharp and joltingly funny work, which lets us see a familiar tale through wise virgin eyes. Benjamin H. Kamine ably steers a bright young cast through Mr. Bradshaw's unsparingly graphic vision of heaven and earth (1:00). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 226-2407, theflea.org. (Brantley)
'Love in the Time of Cholera' Directed by Josי Zayas and performed by an efficient four-actor crew, Caridad Svich's adaptation of the Gabriel Garcםa Mבrquez novel is pleasing but lightweight. A production cannot live on romance alone. In Spanish with subtitles (2:00). Sunday at 2:30 p.m., Tuesday at 11 a.m. only. Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 889-2850, repertorio.org. (Claudia La Rocco)
'My Name Is Asher Lev' Aaron Posner's adaptation of Chaim Potok's novel feels like a well-made play from the era in which the story takes place -- the 1950s. Set in a Hasidic community in Brooklyn, this tale of an artistic prodigy has been directed with an attention to emotional nuance by Gordon Edelstein and features strong performances from its three-person cast: Ari Brand, Mark Nelson and Jenny Bacon (1:30). Westside Theater/Upstairs, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rachel Saltz)
'Old Jews Telling Jokes' With old jokes, a few songs and a little schmaltz, this winning revue is simple, effective entertainment executed with obvious affection (1:20). Westside Theater, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Jason Zinoman)
&#x2605; 'The Piano Lesson' August Wilson's Pulitzer Prize-winning play, set in Pittsburgh in 1936, returns in a galvanizingly beautiful staging by Ruben Santiago-Hudson, featuring memorable performances virtually across the board. A highlight of the year in theater (2:50). Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (Isherwood)
&#x2605; 'Tribes' Nina Raine's smart, lively and beautifully acted play asks us to hear how we hear, in silence as well as speech. This British import considers the passive and aggressive forms of listening within an insular, intellectual family, whose members include a deaf son. David Cromer is the expert director (2:15). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com. (Brantley)
'Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike' Nomenclature would seem to be fate for the title characters of Christopher Durang's sunny comedy about gloomy people. David Hyde Pierce, Kristine Nielsen and Sigourney Weaver portray three siblings (if not three sisters) whose parents burdened them with Chekovian names. Nicholas Martin directs this surprisingly mild-mannered work from a savage satirist (2:30). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Water by the Spoonful' Quiara Alegrםa Hudes's moving collage of lives in crisis, the 2012 winner of the Pulitzer Prize for drama, is the second part of a trilogy centering on the Ortiz family. Elliot (the fine Armando Riesco), a former Marine injured in Iraq, struggles with the loss of the aunt who raised him and a tempestuous reconnection with the ex-crack-addict mother who abandoned him (2:10). Second Stage Theater, 305 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422, 2st.com. (Isherwood)

'Grimly Handsome' Weird urban wildlife, funny and expansive language, and three terrific actors: What's not to like about Julia Jarcho's latest play, which mucks around in the darkly rich underbelly of the city? The play, part of Incubator Arts Project's Other Forces festival, has no intermission (1:30). Incubator Arts Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101, incubatorarts.org. (La Rocco)
&#x2605; 'Inflatable Frankenstein' A sticky, gooey, embarrassing and essential mess, which is what happens when you set about to give birth to something like a monster -- or a play. This gleeful hourlong exploration of Mary Shelley's novel and its descendants comes from Radiohole, the Brooklyn-based company that has dedicated itself to the proposition that art isn't tidy (1:00). (This work is a Radiohole production, presented by Performance Space 122 and the Kitchen, as part of PS 122's Coil Festival.) The Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793, Ext. 11, thekitchen.org. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Patti Issues' In his funny, tender coming-of-age monologue, Ben Rimalower traces the obsessive Patti LuPone fandom that provided him with an empowering role model. That inspiration proved perhaps most useful to Mr. Rimalower in processing the fallout after his father kicked down the closet door and bailed on the family. While on one hand, this is the story of many young gay men's propensity for diva worship, the tartly observed show goes several steps further by exploring the wide-eyed experiences that result when the acolyte gets to interact with his idol (1:00). Duplex Cabaret Theater, 61 Christopher Street, at Seventh Avenue, Greenwich Village, pattiissues.brownpapertickets.com. (Rooney)

'Emotional Creature' (closes on Sunday) This collage of songs, monologues and spoken-word pieces by Eve Ensler explore the problems facing young women around the globe, from sex-slavery to the plague of mean girls.

'Golden Age' (closes on Sunday) Terrence McNally's comedy-drama, set backstage on the first night of the opera composer Vincenzo Bellini's last opera (''I Puritani''), is sadly hackneyed and contrived.

&#x2605; 'The Great God Pan' (closes on Sunday) The new play from the terrific young playwright Amy Herzog (''4000 Miles'') is an oblique but moving drama about a young man (the excellent Jeremy Strong) agonized by the discovery that he may (or, if he can trust his hazy memory, may not) have been sexually abused as a child. Under Carolyn Cantor's direction, an altogether terrific cast, including Becky Ann Baker and Peter Friedman, draws out all the quiet heartbreak in Ms. Herzog's keenly observed writing (1:25).

Start your Oscar Ballot here.
LOS ANGELES - Torture. Terror. Mental illness. Revolt. Where's Uggie the dog when you need him?
The 85th Academy Awards season jolted into place on Thursday as the heaviest number of Oscar nominations - including nods for best picture - went to "Lincoln," about a president's struggle with the Civil War; "Life of Pi," about a shipwreck survivor and a tiger; "Silver Linings Playbook," a comedy, of sorts, about a man with bipolar disorder; and "Les Misיrables," filled with songs of the oppressed.
Close behind were "Argo," about political captivity; "Amour," a French-language film about aging and dying; and "Django Unchained," a tale of slavery and retribution.
"Beasts of the Southern Wild," which chronicles a child's encounters with rising floodwaters in the bayou, and "Zero Dark Thirty," about the murky pursuit of a national enemy, also received best picture nominations. 
But the shocker was a triple snub in the best director category: Kathryn Bigelow ("Zero Dark Thirty"), Ben Affleck ("Argo") and Quentin Tarantino ("Django Unchained") were passed over despite widespread expectations that one or all of them would be nominated. Instead, the nominations went to Steven Spielberg ("Lincoln"), Ang Lee ("Life of Pi"), Michael Haneke ("Amour"), David O. Russell ("Silver Linings Playbook") and Benh Zeitlin ("Beasts of the Southern Wild," his first film).
"We didn't destroy the hotel room too badly, but it was definitely a blind celebratory panic that we went into," Mr. Zeitlin said in a telephone interview.
In all, nine films received best picture nominations in a field that can include as many as 10 or as few as 5, depending on how voters from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences spread their hand.
Mr. Spielberg's "Lincoln" was considered the picture to beat, and it led the field with 12 nominations. It remains to be seen, however, if "Lincoln" will end up more like "The Artist," which last year established dominance (with help from its cheery Jack Russell terrier co-star, Uggie) and won best picture, or Mr. Spielberg's own "Saving Private Ryan," which seemed to lead through much of the 1999 awards season but lost out to "Shakespeare in Love."
The nominations were announced at the Academy's Beverly Hills headquarters in an early-morning ceremony that paired the actress Emma Stone with the host of this year's Oscar telecast, Seth MacFarlane. The unusual inclusion of Mr. MacFarlane, creator of the animated television show "Family Guy," was an effort by the Academy to increase his public profile. Only once before (in 1972, when Charlton Heston did it) has a host announced nominees.
Mr. MacFarlane worked hard to squelch skepticism about his selection as host and to hint at what will come on Oscar night, cracking a series of one-liners that mocked the self-seriousness of the Oscars and the craft of moviemaking. The directing nominees, he said, are "the very best at sitting in a chair and watching other people make a movie." Of the foreign film "Amour," he said, "The last time Austria and Germany got together and co-produced something, it was Hitler." (Cue nervous laughter from the 400 or so reporters in the room.)
Hollywood faces a somewhat longer than usual campaign period. A new digital voting system - despite its reported hitches - allowed the Academy to announce nominees two weeks earlier than it did last year, and more than six weeks before the awards ceremony, which ABC will broadcast on Feb. 24.
"Lincoln" was followed closely in the balloting by "Life of Pi," which surpassed expectations by coming up second with 11 nominations, even as "Zero Dark Thirty," an early favorite, fell into the pack, with just 5.
Mr. Spielberg's directing nomination was his seventh, while Daniel Day-Lewis received his fifth best actor nomination, this time for his portrayal of Lincoln. (He has won twice.) Sally Field was among the "Lincoln" nominees, as a supporting actress for playing Mary Todd Lincoln, as was Tony Kushner, for writing the film's adapted script.
All of that, as well as an aggressive promotional campaign that found the film playing as a civics lesson of a sort when it was screened for the United States Senate, has helped create a sense that "Lincoln" is the most important picture in a self-consciously important field.
"You never ever know how these things are going to go, so it's really gratifying," said Kathleen Kennedy, a producer of "Lincoln," who spoke by telephone on Thursday morning. She noted, however, that it was not a perfect day for the "Lincoln" team. "I was very disappointed that our makeup and hair people weren't recognized," she said.
Though no slouch when it comes to importance, "Zero Dark Thirty," about the pursuit of Osama bin Laden, may have been hurt by controversy, as several senators and a number of political critics tore into the film for the way it portrayed torture.
But Oscar voters gave the film a nomination for Mark Boal's screenplay and nominated its star, Jessica Chastain, for best actress.
All of the year's best actress nominees hailed from movies that have yet to find a broad audience. ("Zero Dark Thirty" did not have widespread release until this weekend.) Along with Ms. Chastain the nominees in that category are Jennifer Lawrence ("Silver Linings Playbook"), Emmanuelle Riva ("Amour"), Naomi Watts ("The Impossible") and Quvenzhanי Wallis ("Beasts of the Southern Wild"), at age 9 the youngest best actress nominee ever.
Joining Mr. Day-Lewis in the running for best actor are Bradley Cooper ("Silver Linings Playbook"), Joaquin Phoenix ("The Master"), Hugh Jackman ("Les Misיrables") and Denzel Washington ("Flight").
Among the clear winners on Thursday was Walt Disney Studios, which had three of the five nominees in the category for best animated feature: "Brave," "Frankenweenie" and "Wreck-It Ralph." The rival DreamWorks Animation had none. "The Pirates! Band of Misfits," released by Sony Pictures, and "ParaNorman," from Focus Features, were the other animation nominees.
"Silver Linings Playbook," from the Weinstein Company, also came up a winner, as seven of its eight nominations came in prominent categories. Robert De Niro was nominated for best supporting actor and Jacki Weaver for best supporting actress. The film was the first to be nominated in all four acting categories since "Reds," released in 1981, according to Libby Wertin, a researcher with the Academy. It slightly outstripped "Lincoln" in the major categories, and handily surpassed "Life of Pi," which had no acting nominees.
In keeping with recent tradition the Academy brushed off the best box-office performers. There were no nominations in acting or directing categories for "The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," "The Dark Knight Rises" or "Skyfall."
The Oscar process has been especially rough this year, as the Academy began phasing out paper ballots in favor of online voting. The idea was to get quicker results, which allowed the group to break precedent by announcing its nominations before the presentation ceremony of the rival Golden Globes, set for Sunday.
But some of the Academy's roughly 6,000 potential voters remained unaware of the shift until balloting was near. Others had trouble accessing a heavily secured voting system. The Oscar nominating vote was ultimately extended by a day, after the documentary branch members got an extension for voting on their shortlist, which was selected under new rules.
The new documentary process, intended to broaden the pool of voters making a first cut of the candidates, yielded what appeared to be a fairly conventional list of culturally hip or politically progressive nominees. Those were "5 Broken Cameras," about Palestinian resistance to the Israeli Army; "The Gatekeepers," about the Israeli security apparatus; "How to Survive a Plague," about AIDS; "The Invisible War," which deals with rape in the United States military; and "Searching for Sugar Man," about the lost career of the singer Rodriguez.
Tom Hooper was bypassed as the director of "Les Misיrables," from Universal. But the film received eight nominations overall, and its presumed strength among actors - Anne Hathaway was nominated for best supporting actress, along with Mr. Jackman's best actor nomination - still make it a force to be reckoned with.
On ABC's Oscar telecast "Skyfall" will presumably be part of a special retrospective on the 50-year-old James Bond franchise. Any other year a Bond montage might be a routine bid for the pop audience. But after the mass killings in Newtown, Conn., and Aurora, Colo., and with Hollywood receiving criticism for its reliance on showy violence, the tribute may pose a challenge for the event's producers, Neil Meron and Craig Zadan, who will have to decide whether to serve up their killer-spy with or without his guns blazing.
The Academy has fought a perennial battle to win younger viewers and to maintain the ratings for its telecast, even as its voters have leaned toward smaller films and sober fare.
For Mr. MacFarlane, who was nominated as writer of the lyrics for "Everybody Needs a Best Friend," from "Ted," the biggest challenge may be the need to wring laughs out of so many serious pictures.
But he is trying.
"If you don't know who I am, just pretend I'm Donny Osmond," he said, getting mileage from a crack about his own baby face. "We'll get along fine."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Heavily Armed and Not All That Bright

Billy Bob Thornton and Eva Longoria may be the marquee names in ''The Baytown Outlaws,'' a splattering action comedy set in the Deep South. But the movie's caffeinated juice is supplied by the actors playing the three Oodie brothers: cretinous, tattooed, muscle-bound hit men who are the ruling outlaws of this modern-day Wild West.
Brick (Clayne Crawford, of ''24'' and ''The Glades''); his baby brother, McQueen (Travis Fimmel, of ''The Beast''); and Lincoln (Daniel Cudmore, of two ''X-Men'' movies), who speaks through an electronic voice box, are so trigger-happy that they shrug off their mistake when it turns out they went to the wrong house to carry out an invasion and massacre in the movie's rootin'-tootin' opening set piece. 
The first feature directed by Barry Battles, who wrote the screenplay with Griffin Hood, ''The Baytown Outlaws'' avidly subscribes to the grindhouse aesthetic of Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez. If it has the right spit-in-your-face attitude, it has neither the stamina nor the wit to go the distance, although it makes it about two-thirds of the way.
The movie is a gun fetishist's dream of endless carnage with minimal consequences. Its attitude: boys will be boys; hand them some weapons and let them get it out of their systems.
The Oodies' glowering protector, Millard (Andre Braugher), is a proudly corrupt Alabama county sheriff with whom they have an agreement to exchange favors. (This African-American Southern sheriff is among several gleeful tweakings of stereotypes in the film.) As the brothers rampage across the Southland, they do battle with gangs of motorcycle-riding strippers, blacks and bow-and-arrow-wielding Indians. These antagonists are in the pay of Carlos (Mr. Thornton), a mobster who describes his operation as ''the Walmart of bottom-dollar retail crime.''
Ms. Longoria's character, Carlos's ex-wife, Celeste, sets the story in motion when she offers the Oodies $25,000 to retrieve her mentally and physically incapacitated godson, Rob (Thomas Brodie-Sangster), from Carlos, whose mansion is the site of the movie's second home invasion. The assignment is not the piece of cake they expected.
Mr. Thornton and Ms. Longoria are so detached from their small roles that they seem barely present. And by the end, nothing has added up to much of anything beyond the expenditure of adrenaline.
''The Baytown Outlaws'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It is extremely gory and has some strong language.
The Baytown Outlaws
Opens on Friday in Manhattan.
Directed by Barry Battles; written by Mr. Battles and Griffin Hood; director of photography, David McFarland; edited by Sean Valla; production design by Monroe Kelly; costumes by Dana Embree; produced by Robert Teitel and William O. Perkins III; released by Phase 4 Films. Running time: 1 hour 38 minutes.
WITH: Billy Bob Thornton (Carlos), Eva Longoria (Celeste), Clayne Crawford (Brick Oodie), Daniel Cudmore (Lincoln Oodie), Travis Fimmel (McQueen Oodie), Andre Braugher (Sheriff Millard), Thomas Brodie-Sangster (Rob) and Paul Wesley (Reese).

10 P.M. (TMC) MY WEEK WITH MARILYN (2011) Michelle Williams, above, in an Oscar-nominated role, steps into the pumps and pencil skirts of Marilyn Monroe, and Eddie Redmayne plays Colin Clark, a documentary filmmaker who claimed to have spent an intimate interlude with her in 1956 while they were making ''The Prince and the Showgirl.'' This film, an adaptation of his diaries, also features Kenneth Branagh, in another nominated role, as Laurence Olivier, Monroe's co-star and director, whose infatuation and ego clashes with Monroe caused him to call her ''the stupidest, most self-indulgent little tart I've ever come across.'' When the shoot went from bad to worse, he told her: ''Just be sexy. Isn't that what you do?'' Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times, ''He didn't get Monroe, and she is similarly out of the grasp of this movie,'' adding: ''Ms. Williams tries her best, and sometimes that's almost enough. She's too thin for the role, more colorlessly complected than creamy, but she whispers and wobbles nicely.'' Still, Ms. Dargis said: ''The problem isn't Ms. Williams or the serviceable work of the director, Simon Curtis, but a script by Adrian Hodges that hews faithfully to Clark's clichיs. Instead of the complex woman familiar from the better books about her, the film offers a catalog of Monroe stereotypes: child, woman, smiling exhibitionist, shrieking neurotic, the barefooted free spirit and, lamentably, the martyr teetering in heels toward her doom. The tragic Monroe is obviously dramatic, but the intimations of disaster don't fit a movie that works so hard to be breezily, easily likable.'' 
7:05 A.M. (Starz) ANONYMOUS (2011) In this costume spectacle directed by Roland Emmerich, Rhys Ifans portrays Edward de Vere, 17th earl of Oxford, who writes politically controversial plays -- the better to extend some behind-the-scenes influence over affairs of state -- and then claims they were written by a drunken, duplicitous and fame-courting actor named William Shakespeare (Rafe Spall). Blackmail ensues. Writing in The Times, A. O. Scott called this film, with a script by John Orloff, ''a vulgar prank on the English literary tradition, a travesty of British history and a brutal insult to the human imagination,'' adding, ''Apart from that, it's not bad.''
2:15 P.M. (MoreMax) THE AMERICAN (2010) A gun-toting expatriate (George Clooney, below) arrives in a small Italian town and takes an assignment to build a custom weapon for a sexy assassin (Thekla Reuten) in this film directed by Anton Corbijn from a script by Rowan Joffe. ''I'm out,'' Mr. Clooney's character says at one point, intent on making the kind of human connection that his taciturn temperament and job -- as a hit man perhaps -- have denied him until now. Soon he is a friend of a priest (Paolo Bonacelli) and a prostitute (Violante Placido), who is so enamored of his prowess in bed that she stops charging him. The film, ''filtering out any mention of the character's history and suppressing all but the tiniest indications of emotion, tries to strip the man to his essence,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The Times. ''But there is not quite enough there: the still waters run very cool but not terribly deep, and 'The American' falls back into a view of its protagonist that is ultimately more sentimental than unsettling or intriguing.''
9 P.M. (13) JOAN BAEZ: HOW SWEET THE SOUND Ms. Baez made her debut at the Newport Folk Festival in 1959; on Aug. 2, 2009, she returned to celebrate its 50th anniversary. Filmed during her world tour that year, this ''American Masters'' documentary chronicles the private life and public career of Ms. Baez, who remains connected with the social movement of the 1960s. The program includes a meeting with Vaclav Havel in Slovakia and a collaboration with Steve Earle in Nashville. Bob Dylan and David Crosby also weigh in.
9 P.M. (Fox) FRINGE The series resumes to find Walter (John Noble) re-entering the deprivation tank to learn more about a mysterious entity named Donald.
10 P.M. (IFC) PORTLANDIA Nina hosts a birthday party for herself, with horseback rides, sunrise yoga and a tapas dinner, to the excitement of Kath and Dave, who've just returned from Spain with a knowledge of things Iberian. But two of the guests have gone to so many shindigs in the past year that they need to take out a bank loan to show up at this one. A sneak peek of ''Out There,'' a new animated coming-of-age story about two high school boys in a small town in the middle of nowhere, follows at 10:30. KATHRYN SHATTUCK

Gun Control Group Urges Expanded Background Checks

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

SECTION: Section ; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 

LENGTH: 601 words

WASHINGTON -- The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, one of the nation's leading gun control groups, said on Friday that it wanted the White House to focus its attention on expanded background checks for gun buyers as part of a broad push to reduce gun violence in the wake of the school attack in Connecticut last month.
The group made the recommendations this week to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and plans to release them publicly Friday afternoon. The Times obtained a copy of the document, which stresses that ''closing the massive hole in the background check'' system is the group's top policy priority. 
''Calling it a 'gun show loophole' trivializes the problem,'' the document provided to Mr. Biden says. ''Universal background checks on all gun sales would have a clear positive impact on public safety, and is also clearly compatible with the rights of law-abiding citizens to own guns.''
Dan Gross, the group's president, said he and other advocates still feel strongly about the need to limit the availability of military-style assault weapons. The group said in its recommendations to Mr. Biden that any proposals should find ways to ''limit the availability of military-style weapons and high-capacity ammunition that are designed for mass killing.''
But Mr. Gross said that the group does not want a debate that focuses primarily on a possible ban of assault weapons.
''We're not rating any solution as bigger or more important than the other. But it's vitally important that the conversation be broader than just an assault ban,'' Mr. Gross said. ''Background checks clearly stake out a middle ground that can save lives.
An even stronger message comes from Third Way, a left-leaning research group in Washington D.C., that has long advocated for stronger gun control laws. Matt Bennett, the vice president for public affairs at Third Way, said Friday that President Obama should not get into a knock-down fight with the National Rifle Association over an assault-weapons ban.
''The assault-weapons ban is a low priority relative to the other measures the Biden Task Force is considering,'' Mr. Bennett said. ''Political capital in the gun debate only goes so far. We think it should be spent on things that would have the greatest impact on gun violence, like universal background checks and cracking down on gun trafficking.''
The caution about the politics of fighting for an assault-weapons ban from some advocacy groups comes as Mr. Biden signaled his interest in focusing on other parts of the gun debate. In public comments Friday, Mr. Biden did not mention the idea of a gun ban.
The White House says President Obama still supports a ban on assault weapons and fully intends to propose and fight for one as part of a broader package of changes. But they acknowledge that the political fight will be difficult, especially in the Republican-controlled House.
Some advocacy organizations are still pushing for a sustained effort to revive the assault-weapons ban, which was initially imposed in 1994 and expired a decade later. But Mr. Bennett said his group was concerned that a prolonged and difficult fight with the N.R.A. over such a ban would make it more difficult to achieve the other parts of the plan.
''While they won't admit it, the N.R.A. probably wants the A.W.B. fight,'' Mr. Bennett said, ''because it will dominate the debate, drive away some moderate members of Congress, and put the focus on a gun ban, rather than their outrageous and indefensible opposition to background checks, a modern gun trafficking law, and the use of gun violence data by law enforcement.''

A Trail of Bullet Casings Leads From Africa's Wars Back to Iran

BYLINE: By C. J. CHIVERS

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 1686 words

The first clues appeared in Kenya, Uganda and what is now South Sudan. A British arms researcher surveying ammunition used by government forces and civilian militias in 2006 found Kalashnikov rifle cartridges he had not seen before. The ammunition bore no factory code, suggesting that its manufacturer hoped to avoid detection.
Within two years other researchers were finding identical cartridges circulating through the ethnic violence in Darfur. Similar ammunition then turned up in 2009 in a stadium in Conakry, Guinea, where soldiers had fired on antigovernment protesters, killing more than 150.
For six years, a group of independent arms-trafficking researchers worked to pin down the source of the mystery cartridges. Exchanging information from four continents, they concluded that someone had been quietly funneling rifle and machine-gun ammunition into regions of protracted conflict, and had managed to elude exposure for years. Their only goal was to solve the mystery, not implicate any specific nation. 
When the investigators' breakthrough came, it carried a surprise. The manufacturer was not one of Africa's usual suspects. It was Iran.
Iran has a well-developed military manufacturing sector, but has not exported its weapons in quantities rivaling those of the heavyweights in the global arms trade, including the United States, Russia, China and several European countries. But its export choices in this case were significant. While small-arms ammunition attracts less attention than strategic weapons or arms that have drawn international condemnation, like land mines and cluster bombs, it is a basic ingredient of organized violence, and is involved each year and at each war in uncountable deaths and crimes.
And for the past several years, even as Iran faced intensive foreign scrutiny over its nuclear program and for supporting proxies across the Middle East, its state-manufactured ammunition was distributed through secretive networks to a long list of combatants, including in regions under United Nations arms embargoes.
The trail of evidence uncovered by the investigation included Iranian cartridges in the possession of rebels in Ivory Coast, federal troops in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Taliban in Afghanistan and groups affiliated with Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb in Niger. The ammunition was linked to spectacular examples of state-sponsored violence and armed groups connected to terrorism -- all without drawing wide attention or leading back to its manufacturer.
The ammunition, matched to the world's most abundant firearms, has principally been documented in Africa, where the researchers concluded that untold quantities had been supplied to governments in Guinea, Kenya, Ivory Coast and, the evidence suggests, Sudan.
From there, it traveled to many of the continent's most volatile locales, becoming an instrument of violence in some of Africa's ugliest wars and for brutal regimes. And while the wide redistribution within Africa may be the work of African governments, the same ammunition has also been found elsewhere, including in an insurgent arms cache in Iraq and on a ship intercepted as it headed for the Gaza Strip.
Iran's role in providing arms to allies and to those who fight its enemies has long been broadly understood. Some of these practices were most recently reported in the transfer of Fajr-5 ground-to-ground rockets to Gaza. Its expanding footprint of small-arms ammunition exports has pushed questions about its roles in a shadowy ammunition trade high onto the list of research priorities for trafficking investigators.
''If you had asked me not too long ago what Iran's role in small-arms ammunition trafficking to Africa had been, I would have said, 'Not much,' '' said James Bevan, a former United Nations investigator who since 2011 has been director of Conflict Armament Research, a private firm registered in England that identifies and tracks conventional weapons. ''Our understanding of that is changing.''
The independent investigation also demonstrated the relative ease with which weapons and munitions flow about the world, a characteristic of the arms trade that might partly explain how Iran sidestepped scrutiny of governments and international organizations, including the United Nations, that have tried to restrict its banking transactions and arms sales.
The United Nations, in a series of resolutions, has similarly tried to block arms transfers into Ivory Coast, Congo and Sudan, all places where researchers found Iranian ammunition.
Ammunition from other sources, including China, Russia, Hungary, the Czech Republic and other former Soviet bloc nations remain in circulation in Africa, along with production by African countries. Why Iran has entered the market is not clear, but ammunition would still be available even if it had not. Profit motives as well as an effort by Iran to gain influence in Africa might explain the exports, Mr. Bevan said. But much remains unknown.
Neither the government of Iran nor its military manufacturing conglomerate, the Defense Industries Organization, replied to written queries submitted for this article.
The researchers involved in the investigation -- including several former experts for the United Nations and one from Amnesty International -- documented the expanding circulation of Iranian ammunition, not the means or the entities that have actually exported the stocks. They are not sure if the ammunition had been directly sold by the Iranian government or its security services, by a government- or military-controlled firm, or by front companies abroad.
But the long mysterious source of the ammunition appears beyond dispute. The cartridges were made, the researchers say, by the Ammunition and Metallurgy Industries Group, a subsidiary of the Defense Industries Organization.
Matching the cartridges to the producer took time, in part because the ammunition had been packaged and marked in ways to dissuade tracing.
Much of the world's ammunition bears numeric or logo markings, known as headstamps, that together declare the location and year of a cartridge's manufacture. Over the years, governments and private researchers have assembled encyclopedic headstamp keys, which can make matching particular markings to particular factories a straightforward pursuit.
The ammunition in these cases included rounds for Kalashnikov assault rifles, for medium machine guns and sniper rifles and for heavy machine guns.
In each case, the cartridges carried headstamps not listed on the publicly available records. The stamps were simple caliber markings and, typically, two digits indicating the year of manufacture.
Similarly, neither the ammunition's wooden crates nor its packaging in green plastic carry bags or plain cardboard boxes, when these items were found with the ammunition, disclosed the place of manufacture. All of the ammunition shared a unique combination of traits, including the caliber headstamp in a certain font, the alloy of the bullet jackets, and three indentations where primers had been attached to cartridge cases. Those traits suggested a common manufacturer.
Over the years, the researchers bided time and gathered data. They collected samples of used and unused ammunition at conflicts and recorded their characteristics. They collaborated with other specialists, exchanging their finds. Some sources were confidential, others were not. Mike Lewis, a former member of the United Nations Panel of Experts on the Sudan, documented the presence of the ammunition at the Conakry stadium crackdown while investigating for Amnesty International.
One sample -- from Afghanistan -- was found by The New York Times, which was surveying ammunition used by the Taliban and provided an image of a then-unidentifiable cartridge's headstamp to Mr. Bevan in 2010.
Once the data was assembled, the breakthrough came in what a soon-to-be-released report by the researchers called ''cross-case analysis'' and by looking away from the ammunition to other sources.
In late 2011 Mr. Bevan obtained the bill of lading for 13 shipping containers seized by the authorities in Lagos, Nigeria, in 2010. The document showed that the containers originated in Iran and declared the contents to be ''building materials.''
But, as the researchers noted in their report, ''concealed behind stone slabs and insulation materials'' was a shipment of arms, including the same ammunition that they had been finding in the field.
The shipping company was based in Tehran, Iran's capital.
Declassified documents obtained via the Freedom of Information Act by Matthew Schroeder, an arms-trafficking analyst at the Federation of American Scientists, later showed that the American military had identified ammunition packaged in the same materials as Iranian ammunition. Mr. Schroeder shared his documents with Mr. Bevan. This provided another link.
Ultimately, Mr. Bevan noticed that Iran had published limited technical details of its cartridges, including bullet weights. Some of these weights are atypical. Late in 2012 he had samples weighed on a jeweler's scale, confirming the match.
Mr. Bevan made clear in repeated interviews that he and his fellow researchers are not advocates for military action against Iran. When they began tracing the ammunition, they did not know or expect that the evidence would point to Tehran.
He also noted that while the ammunition is Iranian-made, it may not have been sent directly by Iran to some of the combatants.
''In terms of prescription, if it was clear that there were repeated violations by Iran, I think we could come down more strongly about it,'' he said. ''But a good portion of this, and in perhaps the majority of these cases, the ammunition was transferred around Africa by African states.''
He added that while the original source of the ammunitions was now clear, many questions remained unanswered, including who organized the delivery to regions under embargo or enmeshed in ethnic conflicts.
Mr. Bevan and his fellow researchers said their findings pointed to a need for further research, to gather facts upon which policy decisions can be based.

Arraignment in Colorado Theater Shooting Postponed

CENTENNIAL, Colo. -- The judge hearing the case against James E. Holmes, the man accused of killing 12 people and wounding dozens more at an Aurora, Colo., movie theater in July, agreed on Friday to postpone Mr. Holmes's arraignment for two months at the defense's request. 
The judge, William B. Sylvester of Arapahoe County District Court, had ruled late Thursday that there was enough evidence presented during a three-day preliminary hearing for Mr. Holmes to stand trial on 166 counts of murder, attempted murder and other charges. But he agreed on Friday to postpone the arraignment until March 12, to give Mr. Holmes's lawyers more time to enter a plea.
Judge Sylvester said that while he empathized with the victims' desire to move forward, he decided it was appropriate to give the defense more time to prepare for the arraignment hearing, given the trove of evidence that needed to be reviewed. Prosecutors had objected to the delay, saying they were ready to proceed immediately.
Victims of the attack and their family members, sitting in the courtroom gallery here, were visibly upset at the prospect of having to wait for Mr. Holmes to enter a plea. As the lawyers and the judge discussed the matter, several in attendance stormed out of the courtroom.
As the court was adjourning, Steve Hernandez, whose 32-year-old daughter, Rebecca Wingo, was shot and killed in the theater, shouted, ''Rot in hell, Holmes!"
The outburst prompted the judge to reconvene the court and gently admonish Mr. Hernandez.
''I'm terribly sorry for your loss. And I can only begin to imagine the emotions that are raging,'' the judge said.
Mr. Hernandez, who was ringed by a group of sheriff's deputies and brought to the front of the courtroom, apologized.
''I meant no disrespect to the court, Your Honor,'' he said.
The hearing has been under heavy security all week, with deputies using hand-held metal detectors to sweep each person entering the courtroom. And emotions have run high as prosecutors laid out their case against Mr. Holmes, a former neuroscience graduate student at the University of Colorado Denver.
Earlier in the week, an agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation testified that Mr. Holmes told investigators that he had planned to blow up his apartment to create a diversion the night of the shooting.
Prosecutors also presented haunting photos Mr. Holmes took of himself with a cellphone in the hours leading up to the shooting. One showed him grinning with the muzzle of a Glock pistol nearby. In another, Mr. Holmes, wearing jet-black contact lenses and donning a cap, jutted his tongue out at the camera.
Mr. Holmes's lawyers did not call any witnesses during this week's hearing and have indicated they plan to argue he is not guilty by reason of insanity.
On Friday, District Attorney George Brauchler reminded the news media that despite Judge Sylvester's ruling that Mr. Holmes would stand trial, Mr. Holmes was still innocent until proven guilty.
''I want to protect the interests of all involved in this case,'' he said.

Antique Cannon in Central Park Found Loaded

BYLINE: By THE NEW YORK TIMES

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 17

LENGTH: 229 words

The cannons of the British warship H.M.S. Hussar were last fired in anger during the Revolutionary War. But when Central Park Conservancy workers arrived to clean one on Friday, the police said, they found it was still loaded with gunpowder and a cannonball, ready to fire. 
The park workers found the ammunition when they removed a plug in the cannon's barrel, said Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman for the police. Then the workers dialed 911. When the bomb squad arrived, Mr. Browne said, ''They tilted the barrel of the cannon and the cannonball rolled out.'' Inside, too, was one pound and 12 ounces of gunpowder wrapped in wool. ''In theory you could have fired that cannon,'' Mr. Browne said, ''because the powder was still working.''
The Police Department provided pictures of the pitted cannon angled upward as it might have been on deck; the cannonball, the size of a melon; and mounds of black gunpowder.
The powder was removed and taken to a gun range for safekeeping, Mr. Browne said, and the wool in which it was wrapped was returned to the conservancy as a historical artifact.
Several ships of that era were named the Hussar, but only one is known to have sunk in the East River, in 1780, when it hit rocks near the South Bronx. It was not immediately clear whether the cannon was salvaged from that wreck. Calls to the conservancy were not returned Friday night.

Makers of Violent Video Games Marshal Support to Fend Off Regulation

BYLINE: By ERIC LICHTBLAU; Michael D. Shear contributed reporting.

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 10

LENGTH: 1137 words

WASHINGTON -- With the Newtown, Conn., massacre spurring concern over violent video games, makers of popular games like Call of Duty and Mortal Kombat are rallying Congressional support to try to fend off their biggest regulatory threat in two decades.
The $60 billion industry is facing intense political pressure from an unlikely alliance of critics who say that violent imagery in video games has contributed to a culture of violence. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. met with industry executives on Friday to discuss the concerns, highlighting the issue's prominence.
No clear link has emerged between the Connecticut rampage and the gunman Adam Lanza's interest in video games. Even so, the industry's detractors want to see a federal study on the impact of violent gaming, as well as cigarette-style warning labels and other measures to curb the games' graphic imagery.
''Connecticut has changed things,'' Representative Frank R. Wolf, a Virginia Republican and a frequent critic of what he terms the shocking violence of games, said in an interview. ''I don't know what we're going to do, but we're going to do something.'' 
Gun laws have been the Obama administration's central focus in considering responses to the shootings. But a violent media culture is being scrutinized, too, alongside mental health laws and policies.
''The stool has three legs, and this is one of them,'' Mr. Wolf said of violent video games.
Studies on the impact of gaming violence offer conflicting evidence. But science aside, public rhetoric has clearly shifted since the shootings, with politicians and even the National Rifle Association -- normally a fan of shooting games -- quick to blame video games and Hollywood movies for inuring children to violence.
''I don't let games like Call of Duty in my house,'' Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey said this week on MSNBC. ''You cannot tell me that a kid sitting in a basement for hours playing Call of Duty and killing people over and over and over again does not desensitize that child to the real-life effects of violence.''
Residents in Southington, Conn., 30 miles northeast of Newtown, went so far as to organize a rally to destroy violent games. (The event was canceled this week.) Mr. Biden, meeting with some of the industry's biggest manufacturers and retailers, withheld judgment on whether graphic games fuel violence. But he added quickly, ''You all know the judgment other people have made.''
Industry executives are steeling for a political battle, and they have strong support from Congress as well as from the courts.
Industry representatives have already spoken with more than a dozen lawmakers' offices since the shootings, urging them to resist threatened regulations. They say video games are a harmless, legally protected diversion already well regulated by the industry itself through ratings that restricting some games to ''mature'' audiences.
With game makers on the defensive, they have begun pulling together scientific research, legal opinions and marketing studies to make their case to federal officials.
''This has been litigated all the way to the Supreme Court,'' Michael Gallagher, chief executive of the industry's main lobbying arm, said in an interview, referring to a 2011 ruling that rejected a California ban on selling violent games to minors on First Amendment grounds.
Twenty years ago, with graphic video games still a nascent technology, manufacturers faced similar threats of a crackdown over violent games. Even Captain Kangaroo -- Bob Keeshan -- lobbied for stricter oversight. The industry, heading off government action, responded at that time by creating the ratings labels, similar to movie ratings, that are ubiquitous on store shelves today.
This time, with a more formidable presence in Washington, the industry is not so willing to discuss voluntary concessions.
Game makers have spent more than $20 million since 2008 on federal lobbying, and millions more on campaign donations.
Mr. Gallagher's group, the Entertainment Software Association, has five outside lobbying firms to push its interests in Washington. And the industry has enjoyed not only a hands-off approach from Congress, which has rejected past efforts to toughen regulations, but also tax breaks that have spurred sharp growth.
Game makers even have their own bipartisan Congressional caucus, with 39 lawmakers joining to keep the industry competitive.
One of those lawmakers, Representative Kevin Brady, a Texas Republican, suggested that the focus on violent video games is misplaced. He said that video games in general are ''a healthy form of education and entertainment for our family'' and said ratings made it easy to keep inappropriate games from his children.
''We find it harder, though, to shield our children from the relentless, in-your-face glorification of violence promoted on our TV screens and in the movies,'' he added. ''It's everywhere, and you can't seem to find the remote fast enough.''
Executives cite 2009 research by the Federal Trade Commission crediting game makers for going further than any other media group to shield children from inappropriate material. Major retailers like GameStop consistently refused to sell ''mature'' rated games to minors, the commission found, and game makers usually did not market them to children.
The industry's biggest political asset may be the 2011 ruling by the Supreme Court that found restrictions on the sale of video games to be unconstitutional.
Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the majority, wrote that evidence linking games to violence was unpersuasive and that games had the same legal protection as violent literary classics like Grimm's Fairy Tales or ''Snow White.''
The scientific record is mixed.
Some researchers have found that games bring out real-life aggression, making players less empathetic. But other studies say the linkage is exaggerated and that game-playing does not predict bullying or delinquency.
The authorities have linked some past attacks, directly or indirectly, to the gunman's fascination with violent games.
In the 2011 rampage in Norway that killed 77 people, for example, the gunman played Call of Duty six hours a day to practice shooting. In the 1999 shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado, which killed 12 people, the two teenage gunmen were said to have been obsessed with a game called Doom, featuring bloodshed and explosions.
There have been reports that Mr. Lanza, 20, the Newtown gunman who killed himself after his rampage, liked World of Warcraft and other violent games, as do many young men. James E. Holmes, 25, who is accused in last summer's massacre at a theater in Aurora, Col., was a fan of the same game.
But the authorities in Connecticut and Colorado have not established a direct link between those attacks and the gunmen's interest in those games.

Democrats Urge Christie to Back Tougher Gun Laws

BYLINE: By DAVID HALBFINGER

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; CITY ROOM; Pg. 16

LENGTH: 518 words

Democrats in New Jersey are stepping up their criticism of Gov. Chris Christie for declining to support new gun control measures in the wake of the school massacre in Newtown, Conn. 
On Thursday, State Senator Richard J. Codey, a well-known Democrat from the Newark suburbs, who says he is considering a challenge to Mr. Christie this year, rebuked the governor, telling him to "step up" and say whether he would support more restrictions, including a federal assault-weapons ban.
"You've said that this is a complicated issue," Mr. Codey said, turning to the camera, as if to address Mr. Christie, during an interview on "NJ Today." "Respectfully, it's not. I urge you to join the president, Mayor Bloomberg and Governor Cuomo, and get on board on this issue. We've been a leader on gun control in this state for a very long time. Step up. Do the right thing. Join us."
Mr. Christie did not mention gun violence in his State of the State address on Tuesday, though the issue was topical enough in New Jersey that Democratic state lawmakers introduced 18 new gun control measures that morning. Making the rounds of talk shows on Wednesday, Mr. Christie argued that federal legislation should address what he listed as other factors in gun violence: mental illness, drug and alcohol abuse, and video games that he said "desensitize" youngsters to violence.
Pressed by Matt Lauer of the "Today" show to say whether he would support a federal assault-weapons ban, Mr. Christie did not answer directly.
"These are complicated issues," Mr. Christie said. "I'm willing to have that conversation. Now that's a lot more than a lot of other people are willing to say. I'm willing to have the conversation, but you've got to deal with these other issues. Otherwise you're just being political."
As Mr. Lauer noted, Mr. Christie supported New Jersey's assault-weapons ban as a legislative candidate in 1995. But as governor, and with his eye on a possible presidential run in 2016, Mr. Christie has deflected calls for tougher gun laws.
In July, after the massacre at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., Mr. Christie said, "It's time for us to enforce the gun laws that we have now, which I think we do fairly well here in this state." Then he criticized politicians who advocated stricter measures as "opportunistic."
Patrick Murray, a pollster at Monmouth University, said that there had been no surveys of New Jersey residents on gun control since the Newtown shootings, but that the issue seldom registered with many voters in the state.
Barring a massacre like the one in Newtown happening in New Jersey, Mr. Murray argued, voters were unlikely to demand action, so Mr. Christie was wise to focus on other issues that could help him achieve a landslide re-election in November.
"He knows he can take heat for it and it's not going to stick to him," Mr. Murray said. "It might be a different issue in 2016, when he's running in a Republican primary. But for right now, his biggest selling point is as a Republican who can win in Democratic territory."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

France Battling Islamists in Mali

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER and ERIC SCHMITT; Adam Nossiter reported from Bamako and Eric Schmitt from Niamey, Niger. Rick Gladstone contributed reporting from New York, and Scott Sayare from Paris.

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 1060 words

BAMAKO, Mali -- The international standoff with Islamists controlling northern Mali took a decisive turn on Friday, as French forces engaged in an intense battle to beat back an aggressive militant push into the center of the country.
Responding to an urgent plea for help from the Malian government, French troops carried out airstrikes against Islamist fighters, blunting an advance by hundreds of heavily armed extremists, according to French officials and Gen. Carter F. Ham, the top American military commander in Africa. One French helicopter had apparently been downed in the fighting, he said.
The Pentagon is now weighing a broad range of options to support the French effort, including enhanced intelligence-sharing and logistics support, but it is not considering sending American troops, General Ham said. 
The sudden introduction of Western troops upends months of tortured debate over how -- and when -- foreign nations should confront the Islamist seizure of northern Mali. The Obama administration and governments around world have long been alarmed that a vast territory roughly twice the size of Germany could so easily fall into the hands of extremists, calling it a safe haven where terrorists were building their ranks and seeking to extend their influence throughout the region and beyond.
Yet for months, the Islamists have appeared increasingly unshakable in their stronghold, carrying out public amputations, whippings and stonings as the weak Malian army retreated south and African nations debated how to find money and soldiers to recapture the territory.
All of that changed this week, when the Islamists suddenly charged southward with a force of 800 to 900 fighters in 50 to 200 vehicles, taking over a frontier town that had been the de facto line of government control, according to General Ham and a Western diplomat. Worried that there was little to stop the militants from storming ever further into Mali, France -- for the second time in less than two years -- intervened with guns and bombs into a former African colony rent by turmoil.
''French forces brought their support this afternoon to Malian Army units to fight against terrorist elements,'' President Franחois Hollande of France said in a statement to reporters in Paris on Friday, noting that the operation would ''last as long as necessary.''
''The terrorists should know that France will always be there,'' he added.
Sanda Ould Boumana, a spokesman for Ansar Dine, one of the Islamist groups that controls northern Mali along with Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, known as A.Q.I.M., and its allies, insisted in a telephone interview that the militants had held their ground.
''Some planes came and bombed some civilians,'' he said. ''A woman was killed. It's a well-known scenario. There wasn't even combat. Planes bombed a mosque. That's it.''
Mr. Boumana called the intervention illegal, saying the French had ''come to support a bunch of murderers. That's France, and that's the West. We are not surprised.''
Malian officials in the capital, Bamako, called the French military strike a welcome shift in the standoff.
''It was evident that the Malian Army would never have been able to handle this,'' said Tiיbilי Dramי, a leading opposition politician. ''The French intervention goes beyond what was hoped for. No one was expecting things would go this quickly. France had said it wouldn't intervene, and Malians were hoping for a rapid intervention.''
Why the Islamists provoked a military strike by capturing the village of Konna on Thursday, a possible prelude to attacking bigger towns on their way to the capital, more than 300 miles away, remained unclear. They were not facing a military intervention for many months, and even then it was not expected to include Western forces.
''Was this a move by A.Q.I.M. toward Bamako? Were they making a move to simply strengthen negotiating position, to gain a little more territory?'' General Ham said. ''The real question is, now what?'' he said, adding that discussions were now under way among Washington, Paris and African governments in the region.
The big prize the Islamists evidently sought -- capturing the major Malian government airfield nearby in Sיvarי, which is vital for any military intervention in the north of Mali -- seemed to be outside their grasp on Friday.
But while senior Malian officers heralded their new military ''partners on the ground,'' some warned that the Islamists remained strong and could still press forward. ''It's temporary,'' said one officer, who was not authorized to speak publicly. ''They have the means to advance.''
Holding off the Islamists, moreover, is a far cry from retaking the north. While tens of thousands of civilians have fled the area, many others remain in the ancient city of Timbuktu and other towns under Islamist control, leaving them highly vulnerable in the event urban warfare breaks out.
Beyond that, extremists in the north, who finance themselves in part by kidnapping and ransoming foreigners, are still holding more than a dozen hostages and have sometimes threatened to kill them if an attack takes place.
Still, Western and Malian officials said the French assault had changed the dynamic of the conflict, accelerating plans for a broader military strategy.
''What's sure now is that things will not happen as we thought they would a month ago,'' said a Western diplomat, who was not authorized to speak publicly. ''We've told Ecowas countries to accelerate preparations to send troops,'' he added, referring to the 15-member Economic Community of West African States, which has agreed to provide an intervention force.
France has a long history of expeditionary military actions in its former African colonies. Mr. Hollande had said that France would not send troops into combat in Mali until Friday, when it seemed that the government in Bamako might collapse. But the French had positioned military contingents near Mali, with deployments in Senegal, Burkina Faso and the Ivory Coast, for example. There were also persistent reports that French special forces were in Mali.
Under Mr. Hollande's predecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy, France also carried out airstrikes to dislodge Ivory Coast's strongman, Laurent Gbagbo, in 2011, bringing a quick end to a bloody four-month civil war precipitated by Mr. Gbagbo's refusal to leave office after an electoral defeat.

How To Shoot A Gun

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; OP-ED COLUMNIST; Pg. 19

LENGTH: 741 words

LEXINGTON, Ky.
It was the middle of the workday -- a bright, chilly Wednesday afternoon in Lexington, Ky. -- but Bud's Gun Shop was crowded. Why was I surprised? The combination of President Obama's re-election and the Newtown massacre has caused gun proponents to stock up, fearing, against all available evidence, that the federal government was about to crack down on gun ownership. As I opened the door, I felt like a teenager about to buy a condom.
My plan was to shoot a gun, something I had never done before. I thought it would help me understand why gun owners are so passionate about their deadly possessions. 
The daughter of a local friend, Don McNay, offered to accompany me. Gena Bigler is the chief financial officer of her father's financial firm, a personal finance columnist and the mother of two. Gena, Don said, is ''very liberal in all her politics, except pro-gun.'' Just like his wife, his ex-wife and many other women in Kentucky, he added.
Bud's Gun Shop was cavernous, with scarcely a square inch of wall space that didn't have a gun on it. As we headed for the shooting range, I asked Gena why she liked guns. ''In the Old West,'' she said, ''the gun was the great equalizer. I think for women that is still the case.'' The first time she shot a gun, she told me, she was 8.
''Let's start easy,'' Gena said as we approached the shooting range. At the counter, Dave, a retired policeman who served as the ''range officer,'' brought out a Ruger Mark .22 semiautomatic handgun. It was a gun that a newbie like me could handle, he gently suggested. A box of bullets in hand, we headed out to the shooting range.
The target was a bright green human silhouette. Gena and I took turns shooting. It took awhile, but once I got the hang of it, I stopped worrying about the shape of the target and focused on hitting it. The .22 made small bullet holes. Gena told me that when she used to shoot in the woods, you could see the enormous damage guns could do to a tree. ''I think children need to be better educated about guns,'' she said, ''so they'll understand better what a gun can do.''
We next moved to a .45 semiautomatic handgun. ''Do you want one that shoots really well, or do you want one you can hide?'' asked Dave. He gave us a Kimber. Its manufacturer describes Kimbers as ''no compromise, purpose-built pistols.'' Certainly from my point of view, it was more difficult to ignore its purpose than with the .22. The bullets made much bigger holes, fire often came out of the barrel, and it had a big kick. It was meant to kill people.
The gallery was filling up. I saw two women shooting handguns, three young men sharing an assault weapon and a man who needed crutches taking target practice. The only noise you could hear was the pop, pop, pop of guns being fired.
Finally, Gena and I rented a Kriss Vector, a shiny black assault weapon. The man who handed it to us called it a ''P.D.W.'' -- or personal defense weapon. ''This gun is made for something like the Secret Service,'' he added. Dave looked at the gun and smiled wryly. ''Blast away,'' he said. The gun had a 30-bullet magazine, which I emptied as quickly as my trigger finger would allow. It took, literally, seconds.
Using the assault weapon was a frightening experience. Even Gena thought so. ''I don't see why anybody would need a gun like that,'' she said. But when I asked her whether such guns should be outlawed, she didn't hesitate: ''That's the beginning of the slippery slope.''
Did I discover on Wednesday afternoon why shooting a gun appeals to so many people? Not really. But I did get a glimpse of why it will be so difficult to change America's gun culture. You can say until you're blue in the face that a gun owner or his family is far more likely to be hurt or killed by that gun than an intruder. But people like Gena -- decent, honorable citizens who grew up around guns -- will never believe it. They will always think of guns as the great equalizer. According to The Cincinnati Enquirer, Kentucky, which has some of the least restrictive gun laws on the books, has no intention of tightening its laws after Newtown.
A few days later, I called Bud's Gun Shop to ask Dave what he thought about the renewed effort to regulate guns. In his calm, unflustered way, he said he thought the problem was mental health care, not guns. ''People have rights,'' he said.
In the background, I could hear the pop, pop, pop of guns going off in the shooting range.

Senator Reid Takes Fresh Aim

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; EDITORIAL; Pg. 18

LENGTH: 416 words

During a tight re-election campaign in 2010, when the vote of gun owners was crucial, Harry Reid, the Democratic majority leader of the Senate, not only showed his prowess with a 12-gauge shotgun -- hitting two clay pigeons from the air -- but also invited Wayne LaPierre, chief executive officer of the National Rifle Association, as his guest for the opening of a new shooting range in Searchlight, Nev. Mr. Reid, a former policeman, eagerly displayed his sportsman's enthusiasm to the voters. 
It turned out his solidarity with the N.R.A. extended to quietly inserting an amendment that year into President Obama's health care reform law that restricted the ability of physicians to gather data about their patients' use of firearms.
The provision, reported last month in The Washington Post, reflected the N.R.A.'s long-running obsession with preventing gun-related deaths and injuries from being studied as a major public health problem that should be controlled the way government monitors risks connected to automobiles, airplanes and consumer products. For decades, lawmakers have let the gun lobby block financing for and limit gun research by the National Institutes of Health and other agencies.
Mr. Reid's office insisted the amendment was intended to head off N.R.A. opposition to health care reform. In any case, mass shootings as a public health threat should be a major part of the debate over gun reform taking shape after the massacre of schoolchildren and teachers in Newtown, Conn. An adviser to Mr. Reid, who will be at the center of any Senate action, told CNN that the senator is now ''in a different place'' on the gun control issue.
Let's hope so. After the shooting deaths of 12 moviegoers and the wounding of 58 others in a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., last July, Senator Reid said there was too little time on the Senate calendar to take up the issue of gun restrictions. But after the Newtown shootings he grieved for the dead and conceded, ''We need to accept the reality that we are not doing enough to protect our citizens.'' Congress must examine how to prevent more gun tragedies, he said, stressing that ''every idea should be on the table.''
Mr. Reid must be held to nothing less as his friends in the N.R.A. mount their ferocious campaign against effective reform. A significant part of the gun lobby's supporters on Capitol Hill are Democrats. As their leader, Harry Reid will be crucial in making genuine change happen, and he will share the blame if it does not.

Gun Sales Surge as Nation Weighs Tougher Limits

As Washington focuses on what Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will propose next week to curb gun violence, gun and ammunition sales are spiking in the rest of the country as people rush to expand their arsenals in advance of any restrictions that might be imposed.
People were crowded five deep at the tiny counter of a gun shop near Atlanta, where a pastor from Knoxville, Tenn., was among the customers who showed up in person after the store's Web site halted sales because of low inventory. Emptying gun cases and bare shelves gave a picked-over feel to gun stores in many states. High-capacity magazines, which some state and federal officials want to ban or restrict, were selling briskly across the country: one Iowa dealer said that 30-round magazines were fetching five times what they sold for just weeks ago.
Gun dealers and buyers alike said that the rapid growth in gun sales -- which began climbing significantly after President Obama's re-election and soared after the Dec. 14 shooting at a school in Newtown, Conn., prompted him to call for new gun laws -- shows little sign of abating. 
December set a record for the criminal background checks performed before many gun purchases, a strong indication of a big increase in sales, according to an analysis of federal data by the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a gun industry trade group. Adjusting the federal data to try to weed out background checks that were unrelated to firearms sales, the group reported that 2.2 million background checks were performed last month, an increase of 58.6 percent over the same period in 2011. Some gun dealers said in interviews that they had never seen such demand.
''If I had 1,000 AR-15s I could sell them in a week,'' said Jack Smith, an independent gun dealer in Des Moines, referring to the popular style of semiautomatic rifle that drew national attention after Adam Lanza used one to kill 20 children and 6 adults at a Newtown school. ''When I close, they beat on the glass to be let in,'' Mr. Smith said of his customers. ''They'll wave money at me.''
Mr. Smith said many people were stocking up on high-capacity magazines in anticipation that they might be banned. Two weeks ago, he said, a 30-round rifle magazine was $12, but it now fetches $60. Popular online retailers were out of many 20- and 30-round rifle magazines.
In Washington, Mr. Biden said the task force he leads is ''shooting for Tuesday'' to make its recommendations to President Obama about preventing gun violence. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, one of the nation's leading gun control groups, said its top priority was to close the loopholes that currently allow 40 percent of gun sales to be made without background checks.
Some groups that support gun control urged the White House not to focus too much energy on an assault weapons ban, which they said could be hard to persuade Congress to pass. Officials at Third Way, a left-leaning research group in Washington, urged the president to save his political capital for higher-priority goals like universal background checks and cracking down on gun trafficking.
Outside Greta's Guns, a gun store in Simi Valley, Calif., about an hour northwest of downtown Los Angeles, several customers said that they opposed any assault weapons ban, but would support more thorough background checks.
George Gray, 60, who said that he already owned ''more arms than arms to bear them,'' said that he was in favor of more background checks. ''If you own a weapon, you should be stable,'' said Mr. Gray, who said he had come from Los Angeles to buy a gun for his daughter. ''You should be accountable for your actions. I don't mind stricter background checks. What we've done with the mental health in this country -- these people used to get care and were in facilities. And in most of these instances, it's been people with mental problems.''
Some customers at Greta's said that they wanted to buy guns before any new gun control measures made it more difficult. Bob Davis, 64, said that he wanted a new pistol. ''They want to take guns out of citizens' hands,'' he said. ''So as a consequence I ordered a gun. And they're not going to be able to get me a gun for like six months, because of the backlog. They can't make guns fast enough.''
The gun industry expected a surge in sales even before the Newtown shooting. Gun sales rose after President Obama was first elected in 2008, and many manufacturers expected an increase in gun sales in the event of his re-election. ''We believe the continued economic uncertainty and the outcome of the 2012 presidential election is likely to continue to spur both firearms and ammunition sales,'' the Freedom Group, which owns Bushmaster, the company that makes the rifle used in Newtown, wrote in a financial report on the quarter that ended Sept. 30.
The possibility that the federal assault weapons ban -- which lasted from 1994 to 2004 -- might be reinstated was enough to spur sales of semiautomatic rifles with military-style features.
Dale Raby, who manages one of two Gus's Guns shops in Green Bay, Wis., said his inventory of guns and ammunition was almost cleaned out, and that most of the interest was in AR-15-style rifles.
''I had almost fistfights over the remaining inventory of that type gun,'' he said.
Joel Alioto, 44, an Iraq war veteran who lives in the area, said he recently sold an AR-15 rifle at a gun show for $1,700, more than three times what he had paid for it. ''I think the shooting in Connecticut was a terrible thing,'' said Mr. Alioto, who is unemployed. ''But before the shooting the gun was worth 500 bucks. I don't think I did anything wrong. I wanted to get my teeth done, get a computer and pay for my first year of Bible college.''
Brad Williamson, one of the owners of Quint's Sporting Goods in Saraland, Ala., said the waiting lists for some products are double what they normally are -- especially for guns that are mentioned in the gun control debate. ''Whenever there's a blip on the news about a particular model, the next day people want to come in wanting whatever they named,'' he said. ''When Biden makes his recommendation next week, you're going to see another surge.''
At Georgia Arms in Villa Rica, Ga., west of Atlanta, the ammunition business was brisk, with dozens of the yellow bins that usually held ammunition empty. The Rev. Laurence Hesser, a pastor at Memorial United Methodist Church near Knoxville, stopped by because he had been unable to buy ammunition on the shop's Web site, which halted sales because inventory was so low.
He likened the current run on ammunition to the rush to buy Twinkies last year after its maker, Hostess Brands, announced it was closing. ''It's the same thing,'' he said. ''When you are threatened with the possibility that you are going to lose something, you get a bunch of it.''

Lawmaker Seeks Public Reply on Guns

SANTA ROSA, Calif. -- A California congressman leading a House Democratic task force on gun violence wrapped up a series of heated and packed town hall meetings on gun control here Thursday night, providing a glimpse into how the debate is resonating beyond Washington after last month's massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.
Representative Mike Thompson, the congressman, who was recently appointed by Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, to seek new curbs on guns, said he would use information gleaned from three meetings this week in his district north of San Francisco to issue a set of recommendations early next month. His efforts join those by the White House and by politicians in states from New York to California to draft a legislative response to the mass killing even as the National Rifle Association and other gun rights supporters gather their forces. 
More than 200 people jammed into an auditorium at a government building here, spilling into the hallways and speaking for three hours. Just a few hours earlier, in Taft, a central California town, a 16-year-old high school student was arrested after entering a classroom armed with a shotgun and shooting another student, though not fatally.
At the meetings, which were held in a heavily Democratic part of California, the state with the nation's strictest gun regulations, advocates of gun rights clearly outnumbered supporters of stricter regulations. Many had responded to calls by the N.R.A. to attend the meetings and hewed to the organization's talking points, trying to steer the debate to what they say is the real source of violence in America: mental health problems, a lack of personal responsibility, and violent video games and the news media.
This week's meetings ran smoothly and were generally free of the shouting and chaos that marked the town hall meetings surrounding the nation's last polarizing debate, over health care in 2009.
Still, gun rights supporters sometimes drowned out advocates of stricter regulations. Several warned of a coming civil war and said they were ''willing to fight.'' There were a few tense moments that Mr. Thompson -- a Purple Heart recipient in the Vietnam War, a gun owner and hunter -- defused.
''Look, I have 30 seconds. I'll do what I want, O.K.? You work for me; I pay your salary,'' said one gun rights supporter to cries of ''yeah!'' from the audience as he stood before the congressman.
''I'll give you a buck and a half and pay you back right now,'' the congressman told the man.
Mr. Thompson, a Democrat and a member of the centrist Blue Dog Coalition, supports banning the kind of assault weapons used in the Connecticut shootings. But he cautioned that there is ''no one bill that could be passed, no magic wand.'' While he described Sandy Hook as ''the worst gun tragedy'' in his lifetime, he added that hundreds of Americans ''have been killed with firearms'' in the four weeks since the massacre.
On Thursday, gun rights advocates here rejected any attempts to restrict access to high-powered guns. Echoing statements by the N.R.A., they stressed that the roots of the violence lay elsewhere, particularly in the lack of mental health care.
A man from Santa Rosa strongly endorsed the N.R.A.'s call to arm school guards. ''The only thing that can stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,'' he said to both applause and boos from the audience.
Like the N.R.A., other speakers blamed violent video games and the news media. ''Every time you get somebody killing 10 people, somebody wants to kill 20 people,'' one man said. ''Get the media to quit naming the names.''
Still, other self-identified gun owners expressed an openness to restrictions on assault weapons.
''I know from personal experience that the N.R.A. does not speak for all gun owners,'' one woman said. ''The N.R.A. is mostly a lobbying organization and represents gun manufacturers, and is mostly motivated by profit. The time is now.''
A man who described himself as a hunter and a former member of the N.R.A. said: ''If you need more than three rounds when you're hunting, you need to spend some time at the range before going out.''
Several speakers accused ''a tyrannical government'' of trying to take away their guns, each time to loud applause. ''It's like you're being controlled by a foreign operation or something, you're voting for somebody other than the American people here,'' one man told the congressman.
''Don't give that man a gun,'' said a man in the audience.
Another responded immediately, ''He can have mine!"
Supporters of greater gun control sometimes had a hard time making their points.
''There is not a tyrannical government trying to take away your guns,'' one man said. ''Everybody needs to be respectful here and give everybody a chance to speak.''
One woman, voicing support for a ban on assault weapons, said that gun rights supporters were trying to shift the debate away from guns. ''I hear a lot about personal responsibility,'' she said. ''But what's really being said is: 'Trust no one but ourselves and our assault weapons. Every man for himself.' That's not a community. That can't raise our children to be healthy. That's an insane asylum.''

Theories and Motives Abound in the Killing Of 3 Kurds in Paris

BYLINE: By DAN BILEFSKY; Sebnem Arsu contributed reporting from Istanbul.

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 6

PARIS -- With her signature long hennaed hair, fiery resolve and olive-green military fatigues, Sakine Cansiz was a feminist, guerrilla fighter and former political prisoner as adept at wielding a machine gun as organizing political protests from a jail cell.
One day after she and two other Kurdish activists were killed in the heart of Paris, speculation abounded regarding Ms. Cansiz, 55, and whether she had been the main target. 
One of her brothers, Metin Cansiz, and activists interviewed Friday said her main role in recent years was to raise money and provide political support for the separatist group she helped found, the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or P.K.K.
Ms. Cansiz may also still have been involved in providing arms for the rebels. In a December 2007 diplomatic cable, made public by Wikileaks, Ross Wilson, the former United States Ambassador to Turkey, named Ms. Cansiz as one of the two most notorious financiers of the P.K.K. in Europe, as well as its ''arms provider and tactic strategist,'' according to Hurriyet, a leading Turkish daily.
Echoing many analysts, Mr. Cansiz said the family was convinced that his sister had been the victim of a professional assassination. It was aimed, he said, at disrupting recently started peace talks that seek to end decades of bloody conflict between the Turkish government and the P.K.K., which is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union.
Ms. Cansiz was a close ally of a crucial player in the talks with Turkey, the P.K.K.'s imprisoned leader, Abdullah Ocalan.
''My sister supported the peace process, and she paid with her life,'' Mr. Cansiz said as family members and hundreds of mourners gathered at a Kurdish cultural center not far from the locked, unlabeled office where Ms. Cansiz and the other two women, Fidan Dogan and Leyla Soylemez, were found fatally shot early Thursday. ''Whoever did this wanted to kill the process.''
Many Kurdish rebels said they believed that Turkish nationalists were behind the killings. But there were competing suspicions. Some rebels speculated that Iran sponsored the attack as a way to destabilize Turkey, which has taken a stand against an Iranian ally, President Bashar al-Assad of Syria.
Turkey's prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said Friday that he believed that the killings bore the signs of an internal feud. In any case, the contours of Ms. Cansiz's shortened life suggest that she would have had plenty of enemies.
Born to an Alevi family of eight brothers and sisters, Ms. Cansiz became politically active in her early 20s, her brother said. What she saw as the impoverishment and repression of the Kurdish community led her and a small group of revolutionaries to found the P.K.K. at a teahouse near Diyarbakir, in Turkey's predominantly Kurdish southeast.
In 1980, after a coup in Turkey, she was arrested and imprisoned until 1991, enduring torture, according to Rusen Werdi, a Kurdish lawyer in Paris.
Her brother, who was imprisoned with her, recalled that she was one of the only prisoners to stand up to the authorities. Activists recalled that she spit in the face of the notorious prison director.
In interviews on Friday, activists said Ms. Cansiz continued to organize demonstrations from behind bars. They said she had initially been attracted by the Marxist ideology of the Kurdish rights movement, which allowed women to escape from the tribal structures of Kurdish society and to take up arms alongside men.
Vahap Coskun, an expert on Kurdish movements at Dicle University in Diyarbakir, said that from its inception, the P.K.K. saw that Kurdish women could provide a powerful base for political organization and on the battlefield. Of the group's 5,500 members, he said, about a quarter are women. In the mid-1990s, some joined suicide bombing attacks aimed at military and civilian targets, sometimes deflecting suspicion by dressing as though pregnant.
After Ms. Cansiz was released from prison, her brother said, she received military training, organized clandestine meetings, traveled to P.K.K. mountain outposts in southeastern Turkey and went underground to Germany to raise funds.
Ms. Cansiz spent time in Syria, where Mr. Ocalan was based, at the group's training camp in Lebanon's Bekaa region and in northern Iraq, Mr. Coskun said. She was eventually sent to Western Europe to work in logistics and fund-raising after the P.K.K. incurred losses in fighting with Turkish security forces, he said.
The German authorities questioned her in 2007 but turned down a Turkish request for her extradition, her friends and colleagues said. She then moved to Paris, and believed that she was under frequent surveillance, they said.
Her brother said that the two had recently celebrated the new year in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, and that Ms. Cansiz had betrayed no concerns about her safety. ''She was never afraid,'' he said. ''She was happy.''

1908 Courthouse Reborn as a Museum

BYLINE: By AILEEN JACOBSON

SECTION: Section LI; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; ARTS | LONG ISLAND; Pg. 8

LENGTH: 1076 words

GLEN COVE, N.Y.
OVER the past century, the Justices Court building at 140 Glen Street has been a courthouse, a jail, a makeshift hospital for victims of the influenza epidemic in 1918 and, more glamorously, the setting for a courtroom scene with Cary Grant in Alfred Hitchcock's 1959 film ''North by Northwest.''
Now the site, which fell into disrepair after the City of Glen Cove vacated it in 1995 but has been undergoing a restoration for a decade, is reopening as the North Shore Historical Museum, which is to have its grand opening on Jan. 19.
''It's the heart and soul of the city,'' said Brian Mercadante, president of the museum board. ''It's where the founding fathers met.'' 
Following its completion in 1908, the building served the Town of Oyster Bay. After Glen Cove became an independent city in 1917, the town gave the three-story brick building to the new municipality, which used it as a court, a jail, police headquarters and City Hall.
At least once, a prisoner escaped while awaiting arraignment. Richard J. McCord, the city's presiding judge, recalled in a video posted in 2011 on the museum's Web site an incident he found amusing.
Some 15 years earlier, he said, a young woman who had been arrested for disorderly conduct after passing out on a sidewalk had to await her turn in his court while being handcuffed in the hallway to an arm of a bench that was ''nearly as old as the building,'' the judge said. She managed to break the arm, he said, then ran out, followed by the building's superintendent, who caught her as she reached a creek behind the building.
Turning the building into a museum was first proposed by Mr. Mercadante in 1997, he said, as a way to make the area more attractive for residents and visitors. At the time, he was vice president of the Glen Cove Downtown Business Improvement District. A year later, he and other enthusiasts received a state charter to start collecting funds and archival material.
Starting the restoration took longer. In 2002, the museum was given a 99-year lease by the owners of the property, Sterling Glen of Glen Cove, a retirement residence next door (now Atria Glen Cove), and in 2006 it bought the building for a nominal $10.
Fund-raising so far has garnered more than $750,000, about half in state, county and city grants and the rest from private donations and memberships (more than 750 so far, at $15 to $50).
The first state grant was used to repair or replace battered windows, doors and the leaking tile roof, Mr. Mercadante said. Rooms were stripped to the outside brick walls before being restored. A documentary showing the process (made by Barry Rivadue, a videographer and museum trustee) will be shown in the courtroom, a large vaulted space that visitors enter first.
At the front of the courtroom is the judge's bench, before a distinctive padded leather panel (which can be seen in the Hitchcock movie). The original had deteriorated, so the museum bought a new cowhide from a North Carolina company and replaced the pyramid-shaped studs, but used Dacron instead of cotton padding ''because it lasts longer,'' said Mr. Mercadante, who owns a local furniture store.
''We saved one radiator, because maybe the kids would like to see it,'' he said, adding that the building now has new heating, air-conditioning and other modern amenities. The spot he thinks will be the biggest hit with children is the jail cell below, the only one of the original three that remains.
Among the jail's more notorious residents was Erich Muenter, a deranged former Harvard instructor who, as part of a plot to force the end of World War I in 1915, tried to take the financier J. P. Morgan Jr. and his family hostage at their Glen Cove estate. However, Mr. Morgan, despite being shot twice in the stomach by Mr. Muenter, fell on the man, twisted the gun out of his hand and supervised servants as they tied him up, according to an account written by Daniel E. Russell, the Glen Cove city historian until his death in 2011.
Mr. Muenter was taken to the courthouse and detained in a jail cell, Mr. Russell wrote. He pleaded not guilty and was remanded to the Nassau County jail in Mineola, where he committed suicide three days later. Mr. Morgan's wounds were not serious.
To replace a set of missing window bars in the cell in Glen Cove, Mr. Mercadante said, the museum hired Forest Iron Works of Locust Valley. ''The owner said his father took off the original door to make the cell into an office, and it was still in the yard,'' Mr. Mercadante said. The iron works owner, Mario Gallo, donated the door -- which has a small opening with an iron flap at eye level -- and arrived with a welder last year to install it.
''The building itself is the museum,'' said Colleen E. Yoder, the museum director, though it will also house rotating exhibitions. She and several docents will provide tours to visitors, she said.
Current displays include old photographs of Winfield Hall, the mansion built by F. W. Woolworth; artifacts and photos recounting the local impact of the Civil War; and a 303-pound bell from Morgan's estate -- the same estate where the financier was shot.
In a small case on the judge's desk, criminal dockets recount a 1934 grand larceny case and another involving an assault. The former judges' chamber and adjacent jury room, also on the first floor, contain a monitor for more videos and oil paintings of North Shore scenes by George Gach, who worked in Roslyn.
On the second floor is an open space with tables where Ms. Yoder said she planned to host programs and other events. The third floor, not open to the public, contains her office and the museum's archives, which she plans to catalog for researchers. Among the items is a 1918 letter listing the blankets, pails, pillows and other supplies that local people donated when the building became a hospital for flu patients.
Ms. Yoder said she was planning a sign-up form for people willing to record their memories on video for the museum, to be ready for the official opening on Jan. 19, the same date that the building was dedicated 104 years ago. ''I think the stories will just start to pour in,'' she said. ''I want to strike while the iron is hot.''
North Shore Historical Museum, 140 Glen Street, Glen Cove, will be open Saturdays and Wednesdays beginning Jan. 19. Admission $5 for adults, $4 for those 13 to 17 and 65 and over, free for children 12 and under. Information: (516) 801-1191 or northshorehistoricalmuseum.org.

Crime Is Down, But Far From Gone

SECTION: Section MB; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; READER COMMENTS; Pg. 2

LENGTH: 1042 words

In last Sunday's Big City column, Ginia Bellafante looked at the difference between perception and reality when it comes to crime in the city. Though crime has fallen significantly over the last two decades, residents of some neighborhoods feel that things are worse than ever. And in certain neighborhoods, like East Harlem, crime rates have gone up, defying the citywide trends. On nytimes.com, readers responded to take issue with policing tactics and with Ms. Bellafante's characterization of iPhones. A selection of their comments is below.
Anyone who's attended a community board meeting can verify that crime remains the No. 1 issue in bad neighborhoods. One problem is that Nycha doesn't enforce its own rules, one of which is that it's supposed to evict drug dealers from its housing projects. If it did, hundreds, if not thousands, of gangbangers would suddenly be without a warm bed at night, which would surely make them think twice about their activities. As for what would happen to the drug dealers, who cares? Living in city housing is a privilege, not a right, since we're paying for it. 
Scott, NYC
Mike Bloomberg ... greatest mayor ever ... of Midtown Manhattan.Chuck D, Ny
We seem to know how to address inner-city violent crime with comprehensive time- and resource-intensive programs like Operation Ceasefire in Boston, but we do not know how to follow up with sustained improvements in such neighborhoods. Boston's experience was that less than 1 percent of youths were involved in gangs, yet they were responsible for over 60 percent of the homicides. Interrupting a supply of firearms, by itself, is not effective as demand will create other supplies, but the demand can be addressed by targeting the core group of offenders, as the communities know who these people are.
The long-term improvements are more difficult. How does one create jobs that would benefit a struggling community? Improve educational achievement, which is different from improving schools? How does one create leadership in a community that can take advantage of improvements in infrastructure? We know how to throw money at problems but appear to be less successful at solving the chronic issues.
I suspect that regardless of how much money we spend, we will not erase the problems associated with poverty, and that the best that we can do is to provide ways out of the condition and to mitigate the impact on the community and the rest of society. This includes no tolerance for violent crime, which will require a change in culture or a removal of the culture that embraces it.

''If only the iPhone could tamp down its hotness; if only it would stop going out and getting drunk in short skirts and heels.''Are you kidding? As if rape culture isn't prevalent enough, the N.Y. Times is now minimizing it by comparing women to iPhones? Do better.

Bad phrasing, but the author was being sarcastic. But the whole Apple thing is another way of trying to blame the victim for the crime. We apparently now have a new class of criminals who feel it's O.K. to steal people's iPods, iPads or whatever. These guys must be the offspring of the '80s thugs who broke into cars all over the city, stealing car radios. Pathetic days may be returning. Back in '81, someone tried to steal the cheap cassette stereo out of my '74 Chevy parked out in front of my Brooklyn house.
NYC Taxpayer, Staten Island
I don't buy the crime stats. I live in Williamsburg and our police precinct is the 90th. Two years ago, I called the police because I heard gunfire across the street at what was then a catering hall. The police did come and when I asked an officer about the gunshots, he told me I heard folding chairs. That was odd, I thought, considering I also saw people leaving the building with folding chairs over their heads. Strange that it wasn't gunfire considering my neighbor's car had a bullet hole in it. I realize police officers work hard and I'm always grateful when I see them on the beat, but that lie really bothered me.
Our house has been burglarized, and yes, our tenant's MacBooks were stolen. In our hood's paper, the police-blotter headline was ''An Apple a Day.'' The thief(s) climbed over our gate, climbed up the fire escape and got in through the open window to steal our tenants' Apples. Williamsburg had (probably still has) transient white teens who squatted in almost-built condos, and supposedly, this was one of their ways to make money for their drugs. ldenise, Brooklyn
As this thoughtful column reveals, New York City (and most cities) will never be free of crime. And in some neighborhoods where illegal weapons get smuggled in from states with lax gun laws, there is certainly a higher risk of being a victim of crime or violence. Those same neighborhoods, however, used to be much more dangerous, when murders and shootings were much more common.
In my work, I have attended community meetings and meetings between neighbors and police officials. What I mostly heard -- from neighbors, clergy members and civic leaders -- was that people wanted more enforcement. What, they always wanted to know, were the police going to do about the young men hanging out on corners and in lobbies and in front of housing projects? They all wanted much more aggressive policing to stop the drug dealing and the violence that went with it, to take away the guns from young men.
The response was much more intelligent policing, using analysis of trends, as well as the increased use of stop-and-frisk. Violent crime came down, especially murders.
Now some people, generally not those neighbors who asked for more police activity, are trying to limit stop-and-frisk, as are civil liberties groups. If they are successful, we may see a much more dramatic increase in crime and violence in those neighborhoods, and many more lives lost.
AB, New York City
More than a million stop-and-frisks in recent years, that's the reason crime has gone down. Yeah, right. Only one problem. Crime has declined in cities that do not stop and frisk, an inconvenient fact. As for East Harlem, it is an area which has seen an increase in gentrification. People are moving in who have things, like expensive computers and phones, which then become targets.

In His Comfort Zone

SEEING Ethan Hawke perched on a folding chair in a grungy Midtown rehearsal space leading actors through a reading is a bit of a shock. Not that he is there: Mr. Hawke is a steady presence in the New York theater scene, and he is rehearsing ''Clive,'' a play about a '90s-era New York rocker gone very, very bad, in which he stars and directs.
No, it's his hair. Vertical and shot through with silver, with notes of green (or is that blue?), his mane looks like a prop, which in a way, it is. ''I don't know how to explain it exactly,'' he said, pointing at his head. ''I didn't want to feel like me when I did this role.'' He added: ''I'm trying to do that old-school, third-person thing by unlocking something as utterly superficial as my hair. I was shooting for a Bowie thing, but then I saw a picture of him after I did it, and he didn't really do his hair like this.'' 
It's a goofy gambit to serious ends, a very physical expression of his desire to do something remarkable. And like much else taken on by Mr. Hawke, a former movie heartthrob and Gen X hood ornament who is now a 42-year-old father of four, it would seem pretentious if it weren't done in dead earnest.
''Clive'' is an adaptation of Bertolt Brecht's ''Baal'' written by Mr. Hawke's longtime friend Jonathan Marc Sherman. For Mr. Hawke the play is of a piece with a theater career that has included founding a scrappy company with like-minded buddies, directing new work as often as he can, and a gritty star turn in the revival of David Rabe's ''Hurlyburly,'' which, like ''Clive,'' was produced by the New Group. That's been mixed with high-minded work like Tom Stoppard's ''Coast of Utopia'' trilogy, for which Mr. Hawke earned a Tony nomination, and the melancholy title character in Chekhov's ''Ivanov,'' which he recently performed at Classic Stage Company.
''He attacked the life of that character, and like everything he does it is very much of the moment,'' said Philip Seymour Hoffman, who starred with Mr. Hawke in Sidney Lumet's movie ''Before the Devil Knows You're Dead.'' By now that's no surprise, he added: ''Almost every single season he is doing something significant here in New York.''
It was Mr. Stoppard who accidentally got the ball rolling on ''Clive.'' He was taken by the intensity of Mr. Hawke's performance in a small role in ''The Winter's Tale'' and said he should think about performing ''Baal,'' Brecht's early play about a murderously misspent youth. Mr. Hawke brought the idea to Mr. Sherman, who settled on a retelling through his own experience of addiction. ''Clive,'' which matches ''Baal'' character for character, scene for scene, begins performances Thursday at the Acorn Theater, with a cast that includes Vincent D'Onofrio, Zoe Kazan and Mr. Sherman himself.
Mr. Hawke will do everything but take tickets -- act, direct, and sing his way through a scabrous portrait of a talented rocker and ferocious addict who is on his way to hell and leaves claw marks in everything around him as he goes. ''He hurts people he loves,'' Mr. Hawke explained. ''But I think Brecht was thinking about something other than whether he's good or bad, and I'm trying to get at those other things with the performance.''
Famous since he was 18 and certified Hollywood bankable after ''Reality Bites'' in 1994, he seemed to have enough cachet to live a relatively privileged professional life. And it's not like he quit on mainstream film work. He received an Academy Award nomination in 2002 for his supporting role alongside Denzel Washington in ''Training Day.'' Lately, with money on his mind, he lined up two horror movies, ''Sinister,'' which did very well, and ''The Purge,'' which will be out in May.
Before that he will come full circle when ''Before Midnight'' has its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival -- the third film in Richard Linklater's series in which Mr. Hawke stars with Julie Delpy in a meet-cute romance that, during the films, blossoms into a long-running dialogue about the nature of love and connection.
Given that he married and divorced Uma Thurman, going through the tabloid spanking machine in the process (he has since remarried), it's not as if Mr. Hawke has completely lived the life of a monkish theater rat. But on balance the work that preoccupies him happens in rooms full of paper coffee cups, dog-eared scripts and long hours.
At the ''Clive'' rehearsal he is collaborative and encouraging, but clearly in charge and clear about what he wants. Before he leaves, he runs a debrief on the day's work with everyone, slaps hands as he says it went ''great,'' and exits.
Walking down Ninth Avenue afterward, he may be the least put-together star you'll ever see. One tail of the shirt is perpetually untucked; whatever he has on most likely emerged from a pile of similarly unremarkable garments.
He talks frankly about the magic coin of celebrity, the one that can be used to party like a rock star, mate with someone fabulous while picking and choosing among projects. He's done all of those things, but at this point in his life directing an Off Broadway play in New York with like-minded actors seems like the highest and best use of his skills. As it turns out, Mr. Hawke, who in movies often played the reluctant pretty boy who was smarter than he was given credit for, has been playing to type all along.
''Early on when I experienced some success, I grew incredibly weary of what fame meant on a DNA level,'' he explained. ''My talent, whatever it was or is, was not strong enough to survive that. I had an allergy to being famous and have been neurotically chasing a larger dream, a substantive life in the arts, so that I didn't end up getting defined by it.''
A great-grandnephew of Tennessee Williams, Mr. Hawke is a New York University English program dropout who has written two novels and is working on a third. He wants to be taken seriously but not come off as a jerk in the process. While some have found his always-on, go-for-broke approach wearying, he couldn't care less.
''I've spent my whole life aping the theater work of others, learning on the way, but I feel like I'm stumbling on something that is original with this group of people,'' he said of his ''Clive'' collaborators. ''You haven't seen a play like this before, and I don't know exactly how it is going to work, but I do know it's what I want to do with my life.''
Even early on in the rehearsals the complicated glories of the project are easy to spot. The music will emanate from seven doors onstage that have been converted to musical instruments, played by the actors. Cords and knobs seem stuck to everything, except the cast members, who play multiple roles. There are a lot of drugs, drink, bloody hookups and the kind of mayhem that puts shrapnel into all bystanders, including the audience.
At the center of it all is Clive, who sees fresh meat everywhere he looks.
Mr. Sherman, a former prodigy who wrote ''Women and Wallace'' at the age of 18, took a significant detour into mood-altering chemicals before rebounding with ''Things We Want,'' which Mr. Hawke directed in 2007. His take on Brecht is built on a Greek chorus of addicts. In one scene Clive is in a room full of them, one of whom lies dead from an overdose even as the rest continue to game their next high.
Surveying the corpse, Clive cuts to the chase: ''He has his rest. We have our restlessness. Both are all right. After sleep we wake up. After sleep he doesn't wake up. Both are all right.'' There's not a trace of empathy in his voice as he cadges the deceased's bottle of whisky and his A.T.M. card.
While the stage will seem littered with shattered glass and broken humans, Mr. Sherman is very happy to be back in business with his antic, energetic friend. ''I think that Ethan should leave his body to science,'' he said. ''He has a level of energy that I have not seen in people outside of those on major substances, and has this level of curiosity that just drives him. Live theater unlocks that.''
Part of why Mr. Hawke finds so much traction in the theater has to do with the nature of the transaction.
''When someone tells you they saw you in 'Training Day,' and that they liked what you did, it feels good, but I wasn't there,'' he said. ''But if it is a piece of theater, I was part of it, and if someone, including other people I respect, comes to see some little play I did, that means a lot to me.''
Mr. D'Onofrio said the dual roles of acting and directing suit a mature Mr. Hawke. ''Ethan has absolute confidence in what he is doing with 'Clive' and what he is doing with the rest of his career,'' he said. ''It's about failing miserably and succeeding triumphantly, both.''
Mr. Hawke says that unlike Robert De Niro or his friend Mr. Hoffman, he cannot invent a character out of whole cloth. Every part he plays contains some component of who he is. Like Jesse, his character in ''Before Midnight,'' he has been divorced, is extremely emotional and dedicated when it comes to his children and is always wondering about the worth of work he chooses. How rare, then, that the young Ethan Hawke and the middle-age Ethan Hawke have been captured, like a time-lapse, in Mr. Linklater's films.
'' 'Before Sunrise' was such an important movie for me because I learned to talk on screen,'' Mr. Hawke explained. ''Before that, all I had ever been asked was to brood for the camera. 'Before Midnight,' because of its sheer existence, ends up being about the passage of time. And yeah, your face falls apart and all that. But what I noticed is how much the same I am, how much of whatever I am is there in each film.''
True to form, Mr. Hawke retains his purchase on boyishness in the movie, but he does seem a little different more than 15 years later. Maybe because he knows who he is.

Despite Protests, Gun Show in Upstate New York Goes On and Draws Crowds

BYLINE: By VIVIAN YEE

LENGTH: 915 words

SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. -- The line to enter the Saratoga Arms Fair at the City Center here had never been so long, and David Petronis, its organizer, said he had never shaken so many hands in one morning.
''I appreciate you opening this show, not giving into the pressure,'' a man told him as he clasped Mr. Petronis's hand in the echoing convention hall, where hundreds of dealers of guns, ammunition, hunting equipment, war memorabilia and antiques were behind tables, talking up their wares. 
Mr. Petronis grinned back. He had not had any intention of giving in, not when a resident recently started a petition to shut down the gun show he had put on in Saratoga Springs four times a year since 1984. Not when several dozen people showed up at a City Council meeting two weeks ago to speak out against his event -- too soon after the tragedy in Newtown, Conn., they said, and too close by. Not when reporters began calling and his name appeared in newspapers as far west as Las Vegas.
And not on Saturday, the first day of the show, when thousands of attendees, three protests and a counterprotest made Saratoga Springs -- more known for its racetrack and mineral springs -- the latest American city to play host to the national debate over gun control.
The dispute has made for outstanding business. The deaths last month of 20 schoolchildren and 6 adults in Newtown prompted politicians to propose additional gun-control legislation. Since then, Mr. Petronis's shop in Mechanicville, N.Y., called Hudson River Trading Company, has sold out of assault-type weapons, said his wife, Cathy, the store's co-owner. On Saturday, a line of mostly male attendees stretched out the doors and around nearly two blocks.
For Mr. and Ms. Petronis, the attention amounts to free advertising. ''The more people to the event, the more dealers are happy,'' he said. ''I'll be answering my Web mail for months.''
The show had not attracted so many people before, City Center staff members said. And it had never attracted so many protests. As traffic snarled and parking spots filled outside the convention center, about two dozen members of the newly formed Saratogians for Gun Safety held up 26 painted wooden angels, copies of those a Connecticut artist planted in Newtown after the Dec. 14 shootings.
The group's members say they oppose the use of the City Center, which is run by a public authority, to support sales of firearms. And there is the matter of sensitivity, they added: other towns in Connecticut and New York have canceled gun shows, with some officials saying they are concerned weapons would be sold that could someday be used in a mass shooting.
''Newtown just happened a few weeks ago,'' said Deirdre Ladd, 46, one of the protest's organizers. ''There are lots of similarities between Newtown and Saratoga, but the difference is that Saratoga has a gun show four times a year.''
Many in the area would say that is a difference to be proud of. Owning a gun or two, or even a dozen, is not uncommon, especially in the nearby Adirondack Mountains. Hunting, skeet shooting and target shooting are popular hobbies.
The protests had left more than a few gun-show attendees feeling beleaguered. Second Amendment advocates handed out fliers to reporters and gathered in small groups, talking anxiously of the state and federal gun-control legislations that many feared were soon coming. ''I don't have enough angels to represent genocide by tyranny,'' read one of the signs in the pro-gun camp opposite the angel holders, attracting honks and waves from passing drivers.
''I feel we're kind of persecuted,'' said Sean Garvey, 60, the president of Dunham's Bay Fish and Game Club nearby, who has been coming to the Saratoga show for 20 years. He sighed and added: ''Gun owners are blamed for certain things. We've been under attack for a long time, and we've been framed for things.''
Donald Fangboner, 70, a retired police officer from Lake George, N.Y., said he had come not just to browse, but also to lend his support.
''I want to see a free America, and if we lose this, it's over,'' he said, patting an anti-Cuomo button on his chest. (Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo recently vowed to enact the country's ''toughest gun assault weapon ban'' in New York.)
A concession Mr. Petronis made was to bar dealers from selling military-style assault rifles similar to those used in recent mass shootings.
Mark Baker, the City Center's president, said that while he and other center officials were sensitive to the concerns of residents who said holding the gun show was inappropriate, they also wanted to honor the center's contract with the Petronises. The arms fair, which runs both days this weekend, is also ''a significant piece of economic activity for this weekend,'' he said.
But he said the City Center authority would review future contracts, including that of the gun show, which, like all other organizations that exhibit at the center, must renew its contract yearly. The officials are also keeping an eye on proposed gun legislation in Albany and in Washington, which could affect the types of weapons that are sold in gun shows or how the sales are conducted.
Anticipating a larger crowd than usual, center officials brought in additional security guards, and the Saratoga police stood near the protest area. But as the day wore on, an uneasy truce appeared to hold.
''Our goal is not to confront them, and I believe theirs is not to confront us,'' said Mike Winn, 52, as he hoisted a wooden angel into the air.

Two Men. One Sky.

BYLINE: By A. G. SULZBERGER

SECTION: Section SP; Column 0; Sports Desk; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 6806 words

T HE CLOUDS stretched across the Texas sky like a highway. And soaring along those lanes, lofted nearly 8,000 feet by the hot air rising from the earth, two hang gliders raced in tight pursuit of the most prized feat in this high adrenaline niche sport: farthest ever flown.
The men suspended underneath their aluminum and fabric wings, Jonny Durand and Dustin Martin, had already journeyed 438 miles in 10 hours, splitting up and converging repeatedly as each pursued his own path alongside the red-tailed hawks and turkey vultures. Against all odds, they were now flying nearly wingtip to wingtip.
Because of the consoles of gadgets mounted on their control bars, the two men knew that they had now flown farther than any person ever had using a hang glider. Farther than anyone had without the drone of an engine or the protective shell of a plane. They had flown, and were flying still, farther than anyone had in the manner dreamed of in centuries of tall tales, from Icarus to Superman -- cheeks in the wind, like a bird. 
Having launched near the southern tip of Texas in July, a few miles from Mexico, the two men had pushed north, propelled by the fierce flatland wind, and at times had reached more than 80 miles per hour.
They crossed low over desolate expanses of cactus and mesquite, which threatened shins full of thorns for any pilot forced into an early landing. They crossed over the concrete sprawl of small cities with houses that looked like pebbles, and over the tumbling, juniper-dusted canyons of hill country, and, finally, over the parched farmland that heralded the northern borders of the state.
There was Durand, dangling under his Red Bull-sponsored wing, who had prophesied that morning, ''I've got a good feeling about today.'' The archetype of the adventurous Australian, he was known to friends as someone who operated best with a few margaritas or at least a decent hangover. There are those who take to the sky and revel in the silence; he filled it with whoops of delight.
And there, soaring alongside, was Martin, the quiet, perpetually destitute product of the American West. His youthful dreams of flight had never given way to more practical considerations. Since he started working at an airport as a teenager, earning less than he handed back for his flying lessons, he had scraped together just enough on the ground to spend as much time as possible off it.
They called themselves friends. But, as those who had spent the previous few days with them would attest, rivals better fit the jaunty, ''sure you're up for this?''competitiveness of the daring prodigies. In the sky, where they snacked on protein bars and water and relieved themselves freely over the world below, they were as evenly matched as two hang glider pilots could be.
As they flew past the old world-record distance -- close enough to hear each other yahooing in celebration -- the question turned first to how much farther they could possibly go. But as the sun retreated and they began their inevitable, decisive descent, another, more pointed question began to nag at the two men: who would go the farthest?
''It was at the front of both our minds,'' Martin later recounted during one of the dozens of interviews with participants that were used, along with video and flight recorder data, to reconstruct the journey. ''After all this, we just happened to be at the same spot. We were starting from scratch essentially.''
And with the knowledge that both had broken the old record but only one might set the record, Durand and Martin began the final push.
Zapata, Tex.
A sports record offers a small claim to immortality: certified evidence that a person not only lived, but also excelled.
The pursuit of this particular record -- farthest ever flown -- had for more than a decade drawn some of the world's best hang glider pilots to Zapata, a dingy border town at the southern tip of Texas best known for oil wealth and drug violence.
The pilots almost universally hated the place, cursing the second-rate Mexican food and the motel room scorpions that kept them company during what could be weeks of waiting between flights.
The locals, too, wondered at this peculiar summer migration to their hard-luck community of 5,000.
The closing of the bowling alley and drive-in movie theater had left complaining about nothing to do as the most popular pastime. Even Falcon Lake, the bass-rich reservoir along the Rio Grande that served as the area's principal draw, was struggling to lure anglers after pirate-style attacks by members of a Mexican cartel who use it to smuggle drugs.
''There's nothing here,'' said Linda Cameron, the manager of Lakefront Lodge, the motel and campground that most of the pilots called home during their annual visits. ''We're 54 miles south of Laredo and we're 52 miles north of Rio Grande, and there's a lot of cactus in between.''
The low-lying area seems an unlikely home for a high-altitude sport. But the town had been identified by Gary Osoba, a former hang gliding pilot who studied decades of weather data to find the place with the best meteorological conditions for long flights.
Around the globe, Zapata stood out for its hot desert air -- laden with enough moisture from the Gulf of Mexico to seed cumulus clouds -- that bellowed northward for hundreds of miles as if out of a giant furnace.
In 2000, Osoba started what he called the World Record Encampment, which drew some of the best hang glider pilots each summer to chase various distance records. There was an entry fee -- to pay for the special plane used to tow the hang gliders into the air and a few other shared expenses -- but mostly it was a casual gathering, with fewer than a dozen pilots flying and socializing for a few weeks.
They returned year after year because the weather models had been right. Before the site was identified, only one pilot had ever flown more than 300 miles. By last summer, Zapata had served as the staging ground for four flights of more than 400 miles.
''Almost everyone who goes to Zapata has had the longest flight of their lives,'' said David Glover, a businessman in Oklahoma City who has attended most years.
That distinction has made the spot controversial among hang gliding enthusiasts, with some regarding the records set there as less than authentic, liking winning a slam dunk contest with the help of a trampoline or a weight-lifting title on the moon.
But for the cadre of pilots who attended the gatherings, the epic aerial journeys carried no asterisks.
The flying was, if anything, more difficult than in many places, requiring pilots to brave high wind and treacherous landings -- in addition to the usual risks like a hang glider tumbling midair or crashing.
''The idea that you can use your wits and skills to defy the law of gravity and cross a vast stretch of this massive state is breathtaking,'' said Pete Lehmann, a part-time flight instructor from Pittsburgh who was among the Zapata regulars. ''Why people go bowling or play golf is simply beyond me.''
The Pilots Gather
Dustin Martin was at his home in Scottsdale, Ariz., on the night of June 29 when his cellphone rang. Seeing the name on the screen, he guessed what was about to happen.
It was Jonny Durand. He and a handful of other gifted pilots had assembled in Zapata. They expected to be there for weeks. And Durand, aware of the risk, wanted his rival to join them.
The two men, both 32, had met more than a decade earlier at a hang gliding competition in Australia, when both were better described as promising rather than accomplished. Since then, Durand and Martin had become two of the top-ranked pilots in the world and had learned along the way that having the other in the air gave them an edge that helped fuel some of their best performances.
When the flying was over, often with them winning the top two places, they would spend the night together swilling beer and taking their chances with women.
''It's been a rivalry since the early days,'' Durand said. ''But we're also friends and enjoy flying together.''
The sport of hang gliding was not much older than these two youthful adherents. But its roots reach much further back.
The most famous design for what could generously be called an early hang glider remains Leonardo da Vinci's of a contraption seemingly pulled from a children's book. By the end of the 19th century, inventors had finally started to figure out the rough mechanics involved in getting a person airborne, birthing a series of gliding contraptions that were unwieldy, dangerous and usually flew only a few feet above the ground.
The invention of the airplane made unpowered gliding seem like an odd relic. But a dedicated few continued to work at it, convinced that motorized flight had eliminated a feeling of elemental conquest.
The modern hang glider emerged out of a simple triangular design, which made it lighter, stronger and more responsive to steering than previous gliding devices. Francis Rogallo, the NASA engineer credited as the father of the sport, predicted men would use them to fly off mountains. And in the early 1970s, scores of brave, perhaps foolhardy, pioneers started doing just that.
Those early years were filled with promise and tragedy. Images of a hang glider soaring through the Grand Canyon were offset by reports of dozens of pilots dying each year in accidents.
Hang gliding became safer as technology improved and training guidelines were established. But even as interest in other extreme sports has continued to swell, the number of licensed hang glider pilots in the United States has dropped by about two-thirds from its peak, to 5,000 last year. Instead, many would-be pilots have taken up the sibling sport of paragliding, the aerial equivalent of switching from skiing to snowboarding.
The hang glider pilots who remained, a group increasingly dominated by gray hair, remained fiercely dedicated to what they viewed less as a pastime than a calling.
Some of the most well-known of these pilots had gathered in Zapata in July, when the weather was ideal. The group included Osoba, who started the world record encampment; Davis Straub, who ran the Oz Report, a Web site that was an online watering hole for hang gliding pilots; Glen Volk, a former national hang gliding champion; Andre Wolf, a Brazilian pilot who had set the South American distance record; Glauco Pinto, another top competition pilot from Brazil; Glover, a former president of the United States Hang Gliding and Paragliding Association; and Lehmann, who was chronicling the gathering for Hang Gliding & Paragliding magazine.
Durand was regarded as the only pilot there with the ability to break the absolute distance record.
That changed after the phone call from the Steak House, where some of the pilots had gathered to trade the same old stories over dinner. A few drinks later, Durand and others decided that they were going to give Martin a hard time for skipping the gathering.
The conversation veered between genuine enticement and friendly trash talk. Durand told Martin that the weather was looking very good. He noted that his own sponsors had paid for his trip and wondered whether Martin's sponsors were being cheap. He mused that in Martin's absence, records might fall.
''I don't know if he really wanted me out there,'' Martin said, ''but he was definitely egging me on.''
Martin had attended three previous encampments, coming closer than any other pilot to breaking the distance record in 2008 with a flight of 410 miles. He intended to skip the 2012 gathering because he was broke and, as he frequently reminded anyone willing to listen to his trademark rant, he hated the place.
But the combination of Durand's needling and the prospect of missing a rare opportunity provoked Martin to make a few phone calls. He consulted with several other pilots in Zapata and confirmed that the sky seemed even more promising than usual. He connected with his main sponsor, the hang glider manufacturer Wills Wing, which said it would send a check for $2,500 overnight to pay the entrance fee and other costs.
Then he texted Durand that he was making the 1,100-mile drive. The response, he inferred, betrayed a mix of surprise and a little bit of nervousness.
''Really?'' Durand asked.
His own car had no air-conditioning, so Martin rented a small hatchback. He lashed his hang glider to the top, crunching the roof sufficiently that he would have to hammer out the dents before he returned the car.
One thought above all had changed his mind: ''I didn't want Jonny to fly 500 miles while I just sat here.''
'See You Up There'
On the morning of July 3, Martin and Durand woke to a text from Osoba: ''Today is excellent.''
Not everyone seemed so sure.
Most mornings in Zapata begin with a long, sometimes heated, debate about the weather. The pilots, conscious that margins matter when it comes to breaking records, agreed they must wait for just the right day. They differed about what that would look like.
On this day, the conditions were something short of perfect. The sky was a bit too clear; only a few white puffs clouded the blue expanse. The wind could have been stronger. The ground was still moist from heavy rain a few days earlier.
But Martin and Durand, hoping the conditions would improve once they were in the air, and eager to escape the monotony of another day of waiting, readied themselves for flight. So did Straub, Lehmann, Volk and Pinto.
''You can't always expect to have everything perfect,'' Durand said. ''You just have to try.''
Martin had arrived in Zapata two days before. Durand's displeasure was unmistakable. And he wasn't alone. Some of the pilots resented Martin's decision to join them only after the conditions had turned so promising. Some were irritated that he had arrived without a driver to make the sometimes daylong retrievals, leaving him dependent on rides from the others.
Martin felt ganged up on, and he let Durand know it, stoking the tension.
Despite his late arrival and some mild protest from Durand, Martin was allowed to launch first because he was the first to get his hang glider assembled and on the runway.
Like the other pilots, Martin carried enough technology to fill a carry-on suitcase: a global positioning device that helped him determine his route, a variometer that measured how quickly he was rising or falling, a flight data recorder that tracked his movements for record verification, a two-way radio to communicate with other pilots and support crew, a rescue beacon that could be tracked online in case he found himself stranded in remote country, and a strobe light in case he landed after sunset.
His clothing was more basic. He wore nylon tights covered with a streamlined jumper. He strapped on a helmet, covered his face with a ski mask and sunglasses, and pulled on a pair of gloves.
He stuffed eight Balance Bars into his sleeves for easy midair retrieval. On a whim, he decided to switch from his usual Clif Bars, a decision he would soon regret when the chocolate coating melted into an irritating mess. He filled a bladder with 70 ounces of water, which he could drink through a rubber straw that hung over his shoulder. As extra protection against dehydration, he chugged a large orange Gatorade.
Then he strapped into his harness, which suspends the pilot into a prone position below the wing -- the hang in hang gliding. On the ground he kept his feet free for launching, but once in the air, he would zip himself into the harness like a sleeping bag.
Finally he turned to Durand.
''See you up there.''
Dustin Martin
At 9:57 a.m., the tow bridle attached to Martin's hang glider snapped tight.
There are two ways that hang gliders typically get into the air. The traditional approach is to run off the top of a hill, mountain or cliff. But pilots also use a technique that has made the sport far less beholden to local topography: towing.
A line is attached from a plane to the pilot and then pulled forward until the hang glider is brought into the air -- a method familiar to anyone who has witnessed tourists parasailing behind boats in beach towns. In Zapata, the pilots used a slow-flying, experimental propeller plane designed for the task and called ''the dragonfly.''
And with the plane sputtering forward, Martin suddenly lifted into the air, riding its wake like a water skier.
The winds whistled and slapped around him. The next eight minutes, he knew, would be the most dangerous of the trip, with countless ways to make a mistake and little time to recover from one. But his ascent went smoothly.
Once he had reached 3,000 feet off the ground, he pulled a cord releasing him from the plane.
He was, at last, in the sky and on his own.
It is a speculative exercise to identify a pivot point in the course of any life, but Martin suspects just such a moment occurred when, as a teenager in Arizona, he picked up a book at his local library. It was a small volume, nearly three decades old, about sailplanes, a type of unpowered aircraft.
After reading the book, Martin noticed that a woman's name and home phone number had been written inside as contact information. He dialed the number, unchanged after years, and the surprised woman guided him to a local airport where he could learn to fly.
Martin headed there and got his first job, earning $2.50 an hour running alongside the sailplanes to make sure they did not tip over as they took off. But even when he was sitting in the cockpit himself, he longed for a purer form of flight, something that was, as he put it, ''more birdlike.''
He tried to replicate the sensation by building a homemade glider out of aluminum tubes and plastic tarps, which succeeded only in providing scrapes and bruises after each painful encounter with the ground. At 16, he took a six-day, $600 introductory course in hang gliding.
Soon he was flying every weekend around the dormant volcanoes around Flagstaff, Ariz. Then most weekdays. He was fired from the airport, the first of many lost jobs, accused of spending too much time looking at the sky.
Martin settled on an itinerant lifestyle: work a few months painting, fixing bikes or teaching hang gliding, and spend the rest of the year flying. He competed in Australia, Europe and South America, throughout the Rockies and then the Alps.
He was soon winning enough to get much of his equipment and travel costs paid by sponsors. Among the small circle of competitive pilots, he was known as shy, even reclusive, alternately funny and fussy, with a savantlike knowledge of the sport.
In 2000, Martin was one of the pilots present for the first record encampment in Zapata. The first day, he flew 202 miles. It was his personal best, but his celebration faded to disappointment when he learned that another pilot had set a world record with a 311-mile flight.
The world record continued to grow, but each time Martin traveled to Zapata, something would go wrong. One year, he was forced to sleep outside for a night while waiting for someone to pick him up after a flight. Another year, he hitchhiked and rode back to civilization inside a border patrol van that had been rounding up illegal immigrants. His 410-mile flight still ranked as the third longest ever, but somehow, the place felt cursed.
''You would never go here for any other reason,'' Martin said. ''You're either moving drugs across the border, you're making money with oil, or you're killing it with hang gliders.''
The Journey Begins
Once in the air, Martin assessed the landscape. The humid morning air, still cool on the skin, dulled the view, creating the illusion that the thicket of mesquite and prickly pear below extended forever.
Regardless of how far he hoped to go, he would have to make it past this perilous territory first.
Because a hang glider is constantly descending -- at roughly 200 feet a minute -- a pilot must find columns of warm rising air, called thermals, to gain the altitude needed to stay in the sky for more than just a sled ride, as short flights are disparagingly called.
Invisible to the eye, thermals are recognizable to most people as the source of turbulence on airplane flights or what allow a bird to circle skyward without flapping its wings. The billowing growth of a cloud on a warm day is perhaps the clearest sign of a thermal, with the cloud capping the rising air as foam does the rising bubbles of a beer, which is why pilots use clouds to help plot their paths.
Strong thermals, which are sought and feared, are capable of lifting a hang glider thousands of feet in minutes. Lighter thermals, the ones Martin was hunting, require precise flying to find and then ascend. In most other places, pilots would simply wait until the day had warmed sufficiently before starting their flights. But for this record chase, every extra minute of daylight mattered.
So Martin traveled cautiously, watching for soaring birds and developing clouds to detect areas with lift, while eyeing the ground to make sure he had a backup plan if he kept descending.
Pilots hated this early stretch of the trip. Air conditions often force them to fly so low that they have to be ready to land at any time. But there was nowhere to land, except the clearings around the occasional oil pump, that did not risk shredding them and tearing up their gliders with thorns up to three inches long.
''Not to be too dramatic,'' Lehmann said, ''but it's friggin' dangerous to land in some of these godforsaken places.''
Even safely on the ground, pilots might have to spend hours lugging more than 100 pounds of equipment in search of a road where they could be picked up. One pilot who could not find her way to a road was rescued by police officers. She was dehydrated and delusional.
Avoiding that nightmarish situation was the main thought in Martin's mind as he struggled to stay aloft that morning. About nine miles after he disconnected from the plane, he sank to just 1,073 feet above the ground.
Jonny Durand
Durand took off at 10:10 a.m., 13 minutes after Martin.
His first goal was to survive that difficult early stretch. His second was to chase down Martin.
Growing up in a forested outpost not far from the Gold Coast of Australia, Durand had also come to the sport at an early age. His father, a skilled hang glider pilot, had purchased some property with an unusual perk: a private mountain.
After school, his father would take him up on tandem flights, during which Durand would toss paper airplanes, watching as they gently sank thousands of feet to the ground.
As soon as he was old enough to carry his own glider, at 14, he started flying himself. Nearly two decades later, his father was still the eighth-ranked pilot in Australia; the No. 1 spot belonged to Durand.
By then, Durand had built something recognizable to anyone in sports marketing as a brand. He was not just winning competitions, he was doing so with a charismatic flair that stood out even among the rugged daredevils around him. He was supremely confident in his skills and almost pathologically energetic, spending nine months of the year on the road and developing a reputation for his practical jokes and partying.
The sponsors embraced him -- first industry stalwarts like Moyes Delta Gliders, an Australian manufacturer, and then mainstream brands like Red Bull, the energy drink maker with an eye on adrenaline seekers.
''Everyone likes Jonny unless you're a woman whose heart he broke,'' said Timothy Ettridge, who encouraged Durand to go to Zapata and volunteered as his driver.
In 2009, Durand flew 323 miles from the clearing atop his family's mountain, still the longest mountain flight in the history of the sport. For the purists, who believe that hang gliding should never require mechanical assistance like towing, it was perhaps the greatest prize.
But for Durand, the larger goal still loomed. He wanted the absolute distance record. And he knew where he had to go to get it.
After he spent a year bouncing among Brazil, Italy and Australia, his trip to Texas stood out not only for its lofty ambition but for its sheer unpleasantness. He had been to Zapata once, several years earlier, to endure three weeks of bad weather that allowed him to stage only a few disappointing flights, one of which ended with a terrifying landing, so he knew what to expect.
''Hot and dry, long days,'' Durand said. ''I knew it wasn't exactly going to be a holiday out there.
''But the margaritas are fantastic.''
Midair Meeting
Thirty miles from Zapata, Durand spotted Martin for the first time. The gray wing with blue and white stripes was just a speck in the sky, about three miles ahead.
The men were approaching Laredo, an old river crossing that had grown into a bustling hub of border country. It was also, because of the federally restricted airspace around the city's airport, the closest thing to an obstacle in the course the men were taking.
Among the more improbable dangers of the sport was the risk of being struck by an airplane. Martin had once come within a dozen feet of such an accident. But of greater concern was this: A hang gliding flight that crossed into restricted airspace was ineligible for the record book.
This was one of the few rules that the two men had to observe during their flight. They also could not be towed higher than 1,000 meters, travel too close to the clouds or fly for more than a half-hour after sunset. These rules were strictly enforced using the flight recording equipment they carried. The previous longest flight ever made -- 438 miles -- was not in the record book because of a technicality.
Durand kept clear of the Laredo airport, while Martin dared to get closer. But both skirted it safely.
''That was the first time I took a deep breath,'' Durand said.
The conditions had started to improve. The sky, which had been mostly clear when they took off, was filling with clouds. The air was warming, and the men were climbing higher with almost every thermal. The difficult morning flying was giving way to great afternoon conditions.
The fight for survival had now turned into a more straightforward test of endurance.
A key to a long-distance flight is to relax. When pilots are tense, flying can offer a Pilates-level workout as the core muscles strain rather than hang loosely in the harness. Maneuvering with the control bar -- pulling in to speed up, pushing out to slow down, shifting left or right to bank into turns -- should require about as much pressure as pushing a full grocery cart. But over the course of the day, the feat they were trying to pull off could be compared to pushing a full grocery cart across an entire state.
After coming close several times, Durand finally caught up to Martin near Carrizo Springs, 114 miles into the trip. It was 1 p.m. They had been communicating by radio, trading bearings and occasionally cracking jokes, and both men were anticipating flying together, with more a sense of relief than rivalry.
''I knew that if we could help each other out, life was going to be that much easier,'' Durand said.
After spending several hours hunting for thermals alone, each man could now watch the other as well, essentially doubling their chances of finding areas of lift. Martin compared the approach to professional bike racing, in which competitors cluster until breaking away.
And Durand and Martin flew together well. A few years earlier, the two men had jointly set the record for the longest flight on the East Coast, 283 miles, flying from Central Florida deep into Georgia, eventually landing side by side.
They had similar flying styles. Both made quick decisions in the air and remained steady through difficult moments. And, setting them apart from other competitive pilots, they flew unusually fast, which eats up altitude quicker, believing the increased risk of an early landing was offset by the extra gain in mileage.
''We both know what the plan is: stay up and try to go as fast as we can,'' Martin said.
After meeting up, the men took their first break: eating, stretching and taking pictures as they flew. And they shared a feeling they had until then been reluctant to voice: ''The day is getting really good.''
As if to prove the point, soon afterward, they hit their biggest thermal of the trip, circling each other as they rose 1,000 feet a minute. At that speed, the world retreats fast; entire landscapes dissolve into broad swaths of color.
They reached well over a mile above the ground, nearly high enough to scrape the underbellies of the clouds.
Endurance Test
At Uvalde, where the land brightens through a valley that nourishes herds of beef cattle, they forked west off U.S. Highway 83, which they had been following from above. They tracked State Highway 55, mimicking the curves of the Nueces River as it wound into the Texas Hill Country.
Though they were not tethered in any way to these roads, they used them like landmarks to help guide their flight, even as they occasionally diverted miles from them to pursue areas with better flying conditions.
The Hill Country was known as the most technically challenging segment of the trip. The ridges and folds in the earth stir up the wind, making the air more violent and unpredictable. The rising terrain eats at the altitude from below while providing few places to land. Many record attempts fell short there.
For the first time all day, nearly 240 miles into the journey, Durand seemed to have an edge, soaring comfortably at 7,000 feet while Martin descended to nearly 2,000 feet.
Durand, anticipating the difficult terrain, had decided to fly more cautiously, slowing to preserve altitude. He had once been forced to land in the area -- ''the scariest landing I've ever had,'' he said -- and was not eager to repeat the experience.
Martin, though, had maintained his aggressive approach, costing him the height he had worked so hard throughout the day to gain.
At one point, hours earlier, Martin had been forced to enter what looked from above like a mini-tornado. It was a dust devil, a thermal strong enough to suck up a column of dust and other debris and which any experienced pilot knew should generally be avoided. But if he had not gone higher, Martin faced a difficult landing -- and no record.
Experienced pilots are like risk calculators, rapidly weighing the dangers of any course of action. Martin carried two reserve parachutes, rather than the customary one, to provide the extra security he needed to push the odds.
Inside that dust devil, the air had churned violently around him. A roller coaster, which provides momentary loss of gravity during drops and the accelerating forces of it during fast turns, may be the most apt analogy. At the time, the gamble had paid off, giving him thousands of feet of extra altitude.
But now he was uncomfortably low again, searching for any promising thermal as he watched Durand all but disappear ahead of him.
The Race Is On
It took Martin almost an hour to catch back up. Both men had made it through the Hill Country, onto the spare, short grass savanna of the Edwards Plateau.
By 4:38, shortly before some of the workers of the world below finished the labors of an unremarkable Tuesday, the two men were flying side by side again. They had traveled 280 miles.
Durand was mugging for his video camera, describing his excitement and, occasionally, not forgetting how he financed his lifestyle, giving shout-outs to his sponsors.
''I think we're going to do it,'' he said. ''I'm a real happy man right now. Oh my God.''
By then, the other pilots who had launched that morning were already on the ground and heading back to Zapata. Volk had gone the farthest, about 230 miles, followed by Lehmann at about 215. Pinto, dealing with an equipment malfunction, had landed after just 40 miles. Straub had set down at 160 miles after a particularly violent thermal.
''Basically, I got scared,'' Straub said. ''Dustin and Jonny experienced the same thing, and they stayed in it.''
As the other pilots drove south, they marveled that Durand and Martin remained in the air and on pace for the record. The wind remained strong and steady, averaging 23 m.p.h. The sky was still thick with clouds. The sun was still high. And on nearly every climb, they were soaring to nearly touch the clouds.
''That is when we knew they had a chance,'' Lehmann said. ''Everything was on their side. Now it was just a matter of staying up.''
The contest between the two men had developed a leapfrog rhythm. A mistake by the pilot in front was seized upon by the pilot in back, and the lead changed. Then another battle to catch up. And then a repeat. They had by now traded the front spot more than a dozen times.
After two hours of flying close together, suddenly, Martin shot miles ahead.
They were above a lonely stretch, where the few signs of civilization included fields of enormous windmills. Durand strained his eyes to the horizon: ''He's really far in front.''
The day was getting late, and Durand was getting low enough that he was more concerned about landing than he was about catching up. He forced himself to switch his mind-set from winning the contest to staying in the air long enough to break the distance record.
''Before I knew it, he had 10 or 15 miles on me again,'' Durand said. ''I thought, that's it, he's got the world record.''
The Record Falls
Though the official record was 435 miles, the real number to beat was 438 -- the farthest anyone had ever flown in a hang glider.
As that moment approached, Martin, having built a seemingly insurmountable lead, watched his GPS to see when the number ticked over. It was like watching a clock on New Year's Eve, using technology to confirm a landmark that would otherwise be impossible to recognize.
''I was already celebrating my record,'' Martin said.
And then suddenly, there was Durand, flying in shouting distance.
The two men were shocked to see each other again after nearly two hours apart. Durand, who had also been fixated on his GPS to mark the moment, was so surprised that he initially suspected that this was simply a random encounter with another recreational hang glider.
''I couldn't believe my eyes,'' Durand said. ''I thought I'd never see him again.''
They circled each other as they exceeded the longest distance.
For Martin, though, the accomplishment was dulled by a growing dread. He thought he had traveled safely ahead of his competitor, but Durand had pushed hard to regain his altitude and flown fast enough to make up the lost ground. Now the two men were even.
The contest was falling into a pattern that he knew too well. He would build a lead, and at the last minute, Durand would seize it. In competitions, the two men often finished first and second, but as Durand noted, ''Usually it's me in first.''
Martin said: ''I had made the breakaway, and it didn't really work. Here's the guy I've got to beat, and now we're neck and neck and there is no energy left in the atmosphere and nothing really to separate us.''
Around the world, hang glider pilots were calling one another with the news that Durand and Martin were competing for the longest flight ever in the sport. Thousands of pilots gathered around computer screens to track their progress online.
In California, workers at the Wills Wing factory tracked the flight on computers and smartphones, rooting on Martin.
''There was a lot of excitement for sure,'' said Mike Meier, a co-owner. ''You're watching someone do something that's never been done before.''
In Australia, where Durand is popular, hang glider pilots roused themselves from sleep to watch the final hours unfold in an act of national solidarity.
Driving 70 m.p.h. to keep up with the hang gliders from below, Ettridge started receiving dozens of calls and text messages from pilots around the world, wanting to know if the reports could really be accurate. He eventually stopped picking up his phone.
The Final Push
The cooling air was calming after the restlessness of the long summer day.
It was 8:15. The thick cover of clouds had whittled to one tiny puff, under which Durand and Martin converged to make their final climb. The phrase pilots use for this moment, when the thermals disappear almost at once, is ''switched off.''
A modern competition hang glider has a ''glide ratio'' of 15 to 1, which means for every foot it descends vertically, it will travel 15 feet horizontally over the land. That descent is almost imperceptible, but the reality was that Durand and Martin were proving the old saying about what goes up.
As they fought gravity's grasp, tiny decisions would make a huge difference.
Martin, dogged by his past failures, was almost resigned to defeat. Over the course of the day, he had held the lead for more than six hours, while Durand had led for just an hour and a half. The rest of the time, like now, the two had flown side by side.
''I thought, there is a damn good chance he's going to outfly me at the end here,'' Martin said. ''It seemed inevitable.''
Durand was no more confident. He was elated but also worn out. The night before, when Martin had made an early retreat to bed, Durand had stayed out shooting pool and buying drinks. Now Martin could see him rocking in his harness, stretching his neck, looking ready for the long day to end.
''I knew he was wasted,'' Martin said. ''I took note of it because I was feeling strangely fresh.''
But it was more than just the physical toll. In races, there are finish lines, a clear moment when a goal is met, an event ended. But setting a record like this is an open-ended proposition.
After battling so hard just to catch up with Martin, Durand had filled with relief when they broke the old mark.
''I let my mind slip a little,'' Durand said. ''I wasn't really thinking about trying to fly as far as I could at that point. It's like running a marathon, and once you reach the finish line, you aren't really eager to keep running.''
The pilots flew cautiously as their margin for error continued to erode. They stayed close as they circled, blown along by the wind. Durand was restless, leaving tiny pockets of lift before they were tapped out. Martin, worried that his rival would catch something better, trailed just behind him defensively.
Then, at 8:34, Martin hit a small thermal. The pocket of lift was so light that earlier in the day he might not have even noticed it. So light, in fact, that he was not even going up at all; he was being lifted just enough to offset his descent, a phenomenon pilots call ''zero sink.'' Martin circled for six minutes, staying even to the ground but gaining 262 feet of height on his rival.
The realization hit Durand at once. In a journey that had lasted hundreds of miles, these 262 feet would be the difference.
Durand, speaking to his video camera, made a painful peace: ''He's going to get me by a little bit.''
The Journey Ends
As they glided toward the earth, details that had been lost for the better part of the day re-emerged one by one. Patches of green revealed individual trees, trees revealed leaves. They crossed over some cliffs and above an expanse of farmland, a welcome sight for pilots looking for a place to land.
Durand, no longer concerned about going as far as he could, lined up his landing along a road so he could be picked up easily. He skimmed low over a dry field, approaching a farmhouse shaded by a cluster of trees. He unzipped his harness, feeling a sense of relief as his feet dropped under him. He turned into the wind to come to a gentle stop.
He had flown more than 472 miles, or about the distance from New York to Detroit. So far, in fact, that the sun was setting as he landed, 26 minutes later than it had in Zapata. The flight would have taken about an hour in a commercial plane; by hang glider, it had taken nearly 11 hours.
As soon as his feet reunited with the ground, Durand sent a message from his flight tracker that was seen by people watching the final moments online around the world: ''I just landed and would like a margarita.''
Martin had taken his chances, putting the wind squarely at his back to gain as much extra mileage as possible. He no longer had any fears about where to land. He just wanted to keep flying.
Later, after he had landed three miles farther, near the small town of Lorenzo, the two men had an awkward reunion, full of celebration and freighted humor that continued during the 12-hour drive back to Zapata. Durand remained there for a couple of more weeks, cultivating a list of excuses for his second-place showing as he tried again and again to break the record. Martin left as soon as he had submitted the paperwork for the record book.
But in his final airborne moments, Martin was in no hurry for the ground to resume its claim on him. The sun was disappearing beneath the horizon, and the moon had already emerged. There was no euphoria, no exhaustion befitting the conclusion of an epic race. Just the quiet contentment of a man in his element, savoring the end of the longest flight of its kind ever made -- cheeks in the wind, like a bird.

THE WORLD UNTIL YESTERDAYWhat Can We Learn From Traditional Societies?
By Jared DiamondIllustrated. 499 pp. Viking. $36.
The custom among the Pirahד Indians of Brazil is that women give birth alone. The linguist Steve Sheldon once saw a Pirahד woman giving birth on a beach, while members of her tribe waited nearby. It was a breech birth, however, and the woman started crying in agony. ''Help me, please! The baby will not come.'' Sheldon went to help her, but the other Pirahד stopped him, saying that she didn't want his help. The woman kept up her screams. The next morning both mother and baby were found dead.
The Pirahד believe that people have to endure hardships on their own.
The anthropologist Allan Holmberg was with a group of Siriono Indians of Bolivia when a middle-aged woman grew gravely ill. She lay in her hammock, too unwell to walk or speak. Her husband told Holmberg that the tribe had to move on and would leave her there to die. They left her a fire and some water and walked away without saying goodbye. Even her husband had no parting words for her. 
Holmberg was also sick and went away to get treatment. When he returned three weeks later, he saw no trace of the woman. At the next camp, he found her remains picked clean by scavenging animals.
''She had tried her utmost to follow the fortunes of the band,'' Holmberg wrote, ''but had failed and had experienced the same fate that is accorded all Siriono whose days of utility are over.'' Tribes at this subsistence level just don't have the resources to care for people who can't keep up.
Jared Diamond tells these and other stories in ''The World Until Yesterday: What Can We Learn From Traditional Societies?'' Diamond is a geographer at U.C.L.A. whose earlier books ''Guns, Germs, and Steel'' and ''Collapse'' became best sellers, offering sweeping -- and brilliant -- descriptions of how geography and environment shape the destiny of nations.
In this book, he holds up tribal societies as a mirror for our own lives. Through the millenniums, different tribal groups have in effect conducted a series of experiments on how to solve essential human problems. What have they discovered and what might we learn from them?
The most obvious difference between us is that pre-state tribal societies are just a lot more violent. Especially in fertile areas where land is valuable, people often can't wander beyond closely prescribed borders. The cycle of raids and revenge-driven counterraids goes on and on.
Diamond describes a 1961 war between two tribal alliances in New Guinea. The individual battles don't seem ferocious. Groups of 400 or 500 warriors faced off at a distance of 65 feet. They threw spears and shot arrows at each other in uncoordinated fashion. Frequently there would be an ambush and, sometimes, a massacre of women and children.
The problem is that the warfare was constant, and over time the casualties added up. Between April and September 1961, 0.14 percent of the alliances' total population was killed in this war. Expressed as a percentage of the population killed per month, that rate, even though it represents a period of low-level hostilities in the war, rivals or exceeds the average war-related death rates suffered by China, Japan, the United States or the European countries over the century that included World Wars I and II.
Nation states occasionally engage in vast, hellacious wars, but these are rare. Most people in nation states feel qualms about killing another human being and have been taught to restrain their lust for revenge. People in many tribal societies, Diamond writes, do not share these attitudes. Without central governments, they have trouble bringing wars to an end. They live in peril. The highest war-related death rates for modern societies (Russia and Germany during the 20th century) are only a third of the average death rates of tribal societies. Modern societies average war-related death rates that are about one-tenth as high as tribal societies.
This is one way in which modern life is unequivocally better than traditional life. But in the arenas of child-rearing, the treatment of the elderly and dispute resolution, Diamond argues that traditional societies have much to teach us.
We live in codified, impersonal societies. They live in uncodified but more personal societies. When we have a dispute over a traffic accident, we settle it in court and the goal is to arrive at some ''just'' solution, based on the degree of fault and so on. When people in traditional societies have an accident there is a series of ritualistic face-to-face meetings. The goal is not so much to find fault, but to restore the relationship that has been marred by the accident.
We sit around subway cars lost in our thoughts and smartphones. But people in traditional societies converse constantly, learning from one another and sharing. Diamond writes that it was sometimes hard for him to sleep during his research trips because the New Guineans he was staying with would awake in the middle of the night and resume the conversation they had left off a few hours before.
Modern mothers tend to breast-feed children on a schedule. But mothers in traditional societies nurse on demand and spend almost all their time having skin-to-skin contact with their babies, often carrying them in a sling, with the child placed vertically and facing forward, which Diamond suggests might be why babies from certain tribal societies develop neuromotor skills faster than American infants.
''Loneliness is not a problem in traditional societies,'' Diamond observes. ''People spend their lives in or near the place where they were born, and they remain surrounded by relatives and childhood companions.'' Identity isn't a problem either. Neither is moral confusion. Or boredom. Diamond says life is more vivid in tribal societies. ''Being in New Guinea is like seeing the world briefly in vivid colors, when by comparison the world elsewhere is gray.''
Diamond's knowledge and insights are still awesome, but alas, that vividness rarely comes across on the page. There are many strange practices described in this book (in a discontinued practice of one tribe, widows insisted on being strangled just after their husbands passed away). But Diamond's writing is curiously impersonal. We rarely get to hear the people in traditional societies speak for themselves. We don't get to meet any in depth. We don't get to know what their stories are, what the contents of their religions are, how they conceive of individual selfhood or what they think of us. In this book, geographic and environmental features play a much more important role in shaping life than anything an individual person thinks or feels.
The people Diamond describes seem immersed in the collective. We generally don't see them exercising much individual agency. We generally don't see them trying to improve their own lives, alter their destinies or become a more admirable people. It's possible they do not conceive of life in this individualistic way. It's possible they don't see life as a journey, as we tend to, but as a cycle. It's possible they don't conceive of history as having direction, as we tend to, but just as an endless return.
Many books have been written comparing the hyper-individualism of today's society with the more communal patterns that have been left behind. It is hard to learn from this one because the traditional people, at least as described here, feel so different from us.
They don't seem like us, the day before yesterday. They seem like people separated from us by large chasms -- by all the events of our written history, all the ideas of our thinkers, all the teachings of our religions.
This book reminds you how important geography is, but it also unwittingly reminds you how important history and culture are, and how certain core conceptions -- our notions of individual agency, our assumptions about time and space, our moral intuitions about killing and individual dignity -- have been shaped by our civilizations.
Has our society become too impersonal? Undoubtedly. Do traditional people serve as models for how we might alter our lives? It's hard to know. They seem so distant.

ZOO TIMEBy Howard Jacobson
376 pp. Bloomsbury. $26.
Words are everything to Guy Ableman, a novelist for whom prose celebrates ''our lower instincts'' and is therefore greater than poetry. His subject is sex (a giddy reviewer praises one of his novels as ''a verbal spermfest''), and when he's not actually writing he's preparing to, by ''mouth-writing'' on solitary London walks. Despite being an accomplished and celebrated writer with a beautiful wife and an equally beautiful mother-in-law, he is deeply unhappy. Why? Because Guy Ableman has been born into a postliterate age. 
How postliterate is it? Bookstores are going under. Those remaining are not displaying Guy's books, which have been elbowed aside by child vampires. Agents are heading for high ground. Ableman's publisher has shot himself after one last liquid literary lunch. Ernest Hemingway, reincarnated as a homeless lunatic forever scribbling in notebooks, drops dead in the street. Everybody who's nobody is blogging. Things look bleak for serious writers. This is because, according to Ableman, there are no serious readers. The books that sell are vapid crowd-pleasers, and anyway, most people are off to the movies or worse. ''Comedians had taken over. . . . They saw as novelists saw, they enjoyed the rhythm of the language, they deployed exaggeration and bathos as we did. . . . They had a slavish following.''
Ableman, who grew up reading Henry Miller and Brendan Behan and whose early novels had titles like ''Who Gives a Monkey's?,'' saves his livelihood and loses his soul by going over to the dark side -- writing women's fiction with titles like ''The Good Woman'' and ''The Good Daughter.'' He claims to be able to do this because, unlike women writers, he can imagine himself into the perspective of the other sex. We have to take his word for it, since the evidence isn't on the page.
What Howard Jacobson has written isn't really a novel but an extended rant: outlandish, fueled by rage, very much like a brilliant comic stand-up routine, except that it goes on for almost 400 pages. Very little happens in ''Zoo Time,'' and much of that has already happened by Page 1. To Ableman and, apparently, Jacobson, ''only a moron could be interested in plot.'' Unfortunately, ''Zoo Time'' is also thin on characterization: while the narrator certainly qualifies as a full-blooded individual, his companions are cartoons or, in the case of the wife and mother-in-law, exotic, unknowable creatures -- ''herons,'' ''witches,'' ''goddesses.'' So ''Zoo Time'' must be intended as a comic novel of ideas.
One of the ideas is this: Bad novels start at the beginning and end at the end. They tell stories. Storytelling sucks the soul from a good writer. Another idea: If you want to write to sell, you must idealize your female characters, magnify their sorrows, give them Holocaust-size obstacles to sentimentalize and flatten. Basically, you must write ''the pornography of the sentimental'' and never, under any circumstances, be funny.
What will those few serious readers left on earth make of these ideas? Factoring in irony and hyperbole, will they agree with the answers? If not, no worries. ''Zoo Time'' has built-in defenses against criticism, certain to amuse fellow writers and sophisticated readers weary of being marketed to. There's a professional blurbist known as Eric the Endorser (''I laughed till I cried, then I cried till I laughed'') and a nice dig at Amazon reviewers. Jacobson moves to deflate feminist criticism by anticipating and lampooning it. A hostile book-clubber demands of Ableman, ''Why do you hate women so much?'' and cites as evidence his refusal to use ''he stroke she'' for the singular neuter pronoun.
''Zoo Time'' is a fortified castle. While its defenses are impressive, the space they surround is almost empty.

A Conversation with President Shimon Peres of Israel

BYLINE: By RONEN BERGMAN

SECTION: Section MM; Column 0; Magazine Desk; Pg. 18

LENGTH: 3773 words

''This part of the conversation is highly sensitive,'' said the spokeswoman for Israel's president. ''I want all cellphones taken out of the room.'' It was July 25, 2012, and I was interviewing Shimon Peres in a wood-paneled suite at the King David Hotel in Jerusalem. I handed my phone to one of the guards standing at the door, and Peres swiftly opened a scathing monologue against a potential Israeli attack on Iran's nuclear sites. ''Israel cannot solve the problem alone,'' he said. ''There is a limit to what we can do.''
Referring to the continuing tension between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Barack Obama, Peres said: ''I cannot tell you what Bibi's considerations are on the subject of Iran. I am not his spokesman and also not [Defense Minister Ehud] Barak's. That's not my job. I am not looking for confrontations with them. I do think that I can explain the American pattern. America knows how to throw a punch when it has to, in order to keep the world balanced. But the punches follow a set procedure. They don't begin by shooting. They try all the other means first -- economic sanctions, political pressure, negotiations, everything possible. 
''But in the end,'' he added, ''if none of this works, then President Obama will use military power against Iran. I am sure of it.''
I was surprised by Peres's stridency. He had long been perceived as a moderating force on Netanyahu, a mediator between the prime minister and the international community that was losing patience with him. A month earlier, Obama awarded Peres the Presidential Medal of Freedom -- America's highest civilian honor. But the ceremony served only to deepen the rift between Peres and Netanyahu, and three weeks later, as reports became more frequent that Netanyahu was planning to send bombers to Iran, Peres took advantage of his 89th-birthday celebrations to speak out publicly against an attack. The prime minister's office responded with ferocity, proclaiming, ''Peres has forgotten what the president's job is,'' and recalling that in 1981, Peres opposed Prime Minister Menachem Begin's decision to bomb Iraq's nuclear reactor, an act that many Israelis consider a great achievement.
There are those who see Peres's confrontation with Netanyahu as one of the principal reasons that an attack on Iran has not yet materialized. ''I will not attribute any such thing to myself,'' Peres told me. ''Let others say it. I expressed my opinion, and that was my duty. How influential was it? 'Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth,' '' he said, quoting the Book of Proverbs.
Peres's clash with Netanyahu over Iran is only one of many disagreements between the two men. On the one hand, Netanyahu is a conservative prime minister who relies on a hard-line, hawkish coalition and who is likely to win next week's Israeli elections by a landslide. On the other, Peres is Israel's elder statesman, who, very late in his life, has attained a degree of popularity that eluded him throughout his earlier career. In a survey conducted by the Israel Democracy Institute, 84 percent of Jewish respondents said Peres was trustworthy, while 62 percent thought Netanyahu was.
It is a pleasure to spend time with this man, whom David Ben-Gurion took under his wing and who became a top official of the Israeli defense establishment at age 24. Peres is a man of the world, full of insights and curiosity that have not worn down over the years. Though he is about to enter his 90s, he recalls in vivid detail his encounters with central figures in the post-World War II era: a Soviet joke competition started by President Ronald Reagan, marathon drinking sessions with the German defense minister Franz Josef Strauss and what he learned from the founder of modern Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew. But it is Ben-Gurion, and the many years he spent in his proximity, that Peres returns to time and again.
Although he says, ''I take no interest in history, it bores me,'' he devotes much effort to clarifying how significant his own imprint on modern history has been. This may be in part because, despite his enormous contribution to the power of the Israel Defense Forces, Peres never served in the military. Moreover, he was not a native-born Israeli ''Sabra,'' having immigrated to Palestine with his family at age 11.
Peres has been Israel's president since July 2007. He is a firm believer in the power of social networks. There is no move that he makes, no remark or observation that is not immediately reported by his staff (which is, with the exception of a military aide and a foreign-ministry representative, entirely female) on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram. There was a time when Peres made frequent mention of his conception of ''a new Middle East.'' Today, a new Middle East is indeed taking shape, but it is not the one he envisioned. Over the past five months, we sat down half a dozen times to talk about the current state of Israel-Palestine relations, his relationship with and opinion of Netanyahu, and what he now sees as the future of the Middle East and Israel's (and his) role in it. The following answers have been condensed from those talks.
''People usually tend to believe grim words, rather than positive ones,'' he told me in December. ''When you say, as I do, that you are a confirmed optimist, you are seen as unbalanced. But if you look at history, you will see that it is an ongoing failure for pessimism, not for optimism. It has befallen me to live for many years, and throughout them I have seen that faith triumphs more often than cynicism or skepticism. I think'' -- and here he expressed harsh criticism of Netanyahu without explicitly mentioning his name -- ''that if the people of Israel heard from the leadership that there is a chance for peace, they would take up the gauntlet and believe it.''
You don't believe, then, that for now nothing should be done, as Prime Minister Netanyahu proposes?He may do nothing, but that doesn't mean that things won't be done. This idea, that history is a horse that can be held by the tail, is a foolish idea. After all, the fire can be lit in an instant: another word, another shot, and in the end everyone will lose control. If there is no diplomatic decision, the Palestinians will go back to terror. Knives, mines, suicide attacks. The silence that Israel has been enjoying over the last few years will not continue, because even if the local inhabitants do not want to resume the violence, they will be under the pressure of the Arab world. Money will be transferred to them, and weapons will be smuggled to them, and there will be no one who will stop this flow. Most of the world will support the Palestinians, justify their actions, level the sharpest criticism at us, falsely label us a racist state. Our economy will suffer gravely if a boycott is declared against us. The world's Jews want an Israel they can be proud of and not an Israel that has no borders and that is considered an occupying state.
What effect does the bad relationship between Obama and Netanyahu have on the immediate future of Israel and the Middle East? The problem is not between individuals, but between those individuals' policies. It's not whether they can have coffee together or not. Neither one is going to kick the other.
Although perhaps they would like to.It makes no difference. The problem is that Obama would like to reach peace in the Middle East and has to be convinced that Israel agrees with this.
And he isn't convinced?Of course, he's not convinced. He demanded an end to settlements and got a negative response, and they [members of the Likud-led government] are to blame for the ongoing activity in the settlements. President Obama thinks that peace should be made with the Muslim world. We, the State of Israel, do not appear to be thinking along those lines. We must not lose the support of the United States. What gives Israel bargaining power in the international arena is the support of the United States. Even if the Americans do not take part in the negotiations, they are present at them. If Israel were to stand alone, its enemies would swallow it up. Without U.S. support, it would be very difficult for us. We would be like a lone tree in the desert.
What happened during the long period that you tried to mediate between Netanyahu and Mahmoud Abbas [also known as Abu Mazen, the president of the Palestinian Authority]?Abu Mazen and I met for long talks, with Netanyahu's knowledge, and even reached more than a few agreements. To my regret, in the end there was always some rupture, and I do not want to go into the reasons for that now. This is not a simple negotiation -- but I thought the conditions exist to set out on the path. Like the Oslo process, it has to be secret.
And when you say this to Netanyahu?He doesn't argue with me on this. It's not an issue of absolute agreement or absolute disagreement. After all, he accepted my proposal for economic peace to improve the standard of living of the Palestinians in a number of areas. He also made the Bar-Ilan speech [in which Netanyahu accepted the idea of a Palestinian state]. We do not agree in our evaluations of Abu Mazen. I do not accept the assertion that Abu Mazen is not a good negotiating partner. To my mind, he is an excellent partner. Our military people describe to me the extent to which the Palestinian forces are cooperating with us to combat terror.
Today, there are 550,000 settlers in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. There are those who believe that the settlers have eliminated any chance of establishing a Palestinian state, because no one would be able to evacuate these politically motivated people from their homes, which is a necessary condition for any agreement with the Palestinians. The settlers have not eliminated the chance for the establishment of a Palestinian state. The settlements today cover 2 percent of the entire area. The Palestinians have already accepted the Clinton parameters, which include leaving three blocs of Jewish settlements and exchanging other territory for them. In my opinion, many of the rest will leave of their own free will. The difficulty with us is similar to that of the man with a hammer who thinks every problem is a nail. Problems are not nails. If there is good will, they can all be overcome. This applies, for example, to the issue of water. Soon there will be a surplus of water in Israel, thanks to seawater desalination, and we will be able to make up the Palestinians' shortage of potable water. Look, the whole world is in turmoil. The Palestinian problem isn't the main problem in the Middle East. But there are a billion and a half Muslims. The Palestinian problem affects our entire relationship with them. If the Palestinian problem were to be solved, the Islamist extremists would be robbed of their pretext for their actions against us. Of course, this requires concessions. The problem in this case is not only the prime minister but also his coalition. I am not claiming that peace with the Palestinians will solve all the problems. People who think in sweeping terms are being superficial. There are two things that cannot be made without closing your eyes -- love and peace. If you try to make them with open eyes, you won't get anywhere. Peace is not an exciting thing, and it entails accepting many compromises and tedious details. A woman, too, can sometimes be exciting and sometimes less so. There's no perfection. Making peace is complicated.
But what kind of peace are we talking about? Look how President Mohamed Morsi of Egypt sent you a personal letter in July and then denied writing it.Why does that matter? President Morsi has to answer a great many questions inside his own party. I was surprised not by his denial but rather by the fact that he sent me the letter. The whole matter shows me that Morsi, like any leader taking office, faces tough dilemmas. It is very easy to play the role of the abiding Muslim when you are not in power, but things get complicated when you are. Take, for example, the Egyptian economy, which relies heavily on tourism. If they don't allow tourists to come and spend their vacations the way they like, they won't come. No bikini, no tourism.
What attitude should Israel adopt toward the Arab Spring?You ask foolish questions. Israel is an island in an ocean. And when I ask myself, ''What has a greater impact, the ocean on the island, or the island on the ocean?'' I have to maintain a certain degree of humility. The important thing isn't how we relate to it, but what is happening, why there is an Arab Spring. It isn't a soccer match that we are refereeing. The young generation of the Arab world is suppressed and unemployed. That is what brought about the revolution and uprooted the dictatorships, not me and not you. The storm that has hit the Middle East obliges each state to choose whether to enter the scientific age or not. If it does not, it will have no growth. The great and intriguing debate in Egypt today is about the constitution, in effect about whether to give women freedom or not. It is here that the Arab Spring will be judged. President Obama asked me who I think is preventing democracy in the Middle East. I told him, ''The husbands.'' The husband does not want his wife to have equal rights. Without equal rights, it will be impossible to save Egypt, because if women are not educated, the children are not educated. People who cannot read and write can't make a living. They are finished.
In Syria, the end of the Assad regime inches closer. Are you concerned about their arsenal of chemical weapons?Assad knows that using chemical weapons will immediately invite an attack by outside elements. The whole world would mobilize against him. It would be a suicidal act. On the other hand, it's obvious that his days are numbered. A situation in which, let's say, his palace comes under fire, could put him in an irrational state and lead him to act out of despair. If the Syrians dare to touch their chemical weapons and aim them at us or at innocent civilians, I have no doubt that the world as well as Israel will take decisive and immediate action. No less important, Assad is liable to transfer the chemical weapons to Hezbollah, which from our point of view will constitute crossing a red line. It is incumbent upon Israel to prevent such a thing from happening, and it will take firm military action to do so.
During the several monthsover which Peres and I spoke, the conflict between Israel and Hamas intensified. In response to rocket fire from Hamas forces in the Gaza Strip, Israel assassinated Hamas's military commander and launched a bombing campaign that resulted in widespread international censure and ended in a cease-fire engineered by the United States and Morsi. In some cases in the past, Peres expressed opposition to Israel's use of assassination as a weapon to achieve its goals. He opposed the killing of Khalil al-Wazir, the deputy of the P.L.O. leader Yasir Arafat, in Tunis in 1988, and the targeted elimination of the spiritual founder of Hamas, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, in Gaza in 2004. He also protected Arafat from plots to kill or deport him. This time, Peres expressed strong support for the Israeli operation. ''This wasn't a war or a military operation, but rather an educational lesson for Hamas,'' he told me. ''We acted in order to explain to Hamas that it has to decide on one or the other. You want to build houses? No problem. You want to build missile bases inside those houses? Then we'll relate to those houses as targets for our aircraft.
But during the campaign, civilians were killed on both sides, many more in Gaza.We made a supreme effort not to harm civilians in Gaza, although it was very difficult to distinguish between Hamas militiamen and innocent civilians. We have no desire to spill blood, not ours and not that of others. The operation was short, and the moment the lesson was conveyed and deterrence was established, it was stopped.
What lesson do you think Hamas learned?Hamas will now start taking care. Even there, the understanding must penetrate that there's no such thing as a cocktail of gunfire and peace.
The political leader of Hamas, Khaled Meshal, came to Gaza in December to celebrate the organization's 25th anniversary. He delivered a blunt speech, indicating that it's not at all clear that deterrence was achieved. Perhaps the time has come to conduct a dialogue with Hamas?If Hamas accepts international demands, forsakes terror, stops firing missiles at us and recognizes the existence of the State of Israel, it will be possible to open negotiations. Where did this Khaled Meshal suddenly pop out of, with his words that come straight from the Middle Ages? Precisely now, when the whole world is tired of wars and violence, he arises out of the dark of night with these sadistic desires to strike and to murder? Does he really think that they will be able to destroy the State of Israel, with the I.D.F. and our intelligence services? That we are a bunch of turkeys that will march in formation to a Thanksgiving feast?
You didn't think that Arafat should be assassinated. No. I thought it was possible to do business with him. Without him, it was much more complicated. With who else could we have closed the Oslo deal? With who else could we have reached the Hebron agreement? On the other hand, I tried to explain to him, for hours on end, a complete educational course: how to be a true leader. We sat together, with me eating from his hand. It took courage. I told him he must be like Lincoln, like Ben-Gurion: one nation, one gun, not innumerable armed forces with each firing in a different direction. At first, Arafat refused, he said, ''La, la, la'' [Peres does a fairly convincing imitation of Arafat saying ''no'' in Arabic], but later he said, ''O.K.'' He lied right to my face, without any problem [regarding promises to fight Palestinian militias and insurgencies].
You were asked by many important people to run against Netanyahu and reunite the center-left. Do you regret not doing it?They pressed me hard, but I concluded that I should not run, for reasons I do not wish to elaborate on. I was elected president for a seven-year term, and I will carry out this commitment. My record is the only way to judge me honestly. I do not think there are many people in the world who can say they managed to bring down a 600 percent inflation rate, create a nuclear option in a small country, oversee the Entebbe operation, set up an aerospace industry and an arms-development authority, form deep diplomatic relations with France, launch a Sinai campaign to open the Straits of Tiran and put an end to terror from Gaza. I do not, perish the thought, claim to have done all this alone. I just think that perhaps without me it would not have happened. Yitzhak Shamir was prime minister for seven years. So what? I don't think my record is inferior to his.
You have never spoken much about your wife, Sonia, and for decades she was absent from your public life. Why?Sonia always told me that she married a kibbutz cowman, not a politician. She didn't like appearing in public, and she didn't like titles. In family life, you need two things. Both love and compromise.
You didn't seem to compromise so much, but she did.She compromised, and so did I. I never, ever insisted, never asked her, if it wasn't necessary, for her to come. I never said, ''Come for appearance' sake.'' If I'd said it was for appearance' sake, she would never have come.
Still, I imagine that over all those years, you had arguments about when she would go with you and when not.There were arguments, but there was very deep love, both from my side and from hers. It was the only love in my life. She gave me the greatest gift a wife can give a husband -- she brought up our children exemplarily. She knew that sometimes I couldn't come to a child's party, and she forgave me. And if it served the state, she came with me. If it served my career: ''No, sir. A family's life is at home,'' she would tell me. ''Don't mix things up.'' She came to the Nobel Prize ceremony because she thought the prize was being awarded to the state and not only to me.
Five years ago, when you became president, she wanted you to not take office. What happened?Sonia told me: ''It's enough. You've done your share. Come, let's live these years together.'' I told her: ''First of all, I don't know what to do with free time. Second, I think that I can fulfill a duty here, too, serve the country, unite it.'' She said to me: ''Go your way. I'm staying here.'' There was nothing to do about it. Women get edgy about things men will never understand. I packed a bag, and I left home.
Peres moved into the president's official residence in Jerusalem. Sonia stayed on in their modest apartment in north Tel Aviv. In January 2011, one of their grandchildren found her dead in her home, apparently from cardiac arrest. Peres rushed to the apartment and kissed her on the forehead before she was taken away.
You have surrounded yourself with female aides. You told me once that you had many fine male assistants who later went on to betray you. Looking back, are you sorry that from the beginning it wasn't only women?I have always had women around me. Women have a clear-cut advantage in their ability to read people, and I trust their eye a lot more. Each woman is born a mother, and every man dies a baby. There's no woman who thinks a man is fully grown up.
Here, his spokeswoman says, ''Good, now give a nonchauvinistic reply.''
''I've been chauvinistic?'' Peres asked.
''It's even irritating me,'' she said. ''You are having such a good time with this man-talk. Excuse me, you didn't pick women because they treat you like a baby.''
''Ask anyone,'' he said. ''I had the best bureaus in the country. I never boycotted men, but I found women with remarkable managerial talent.''
''You've corrected yourself a little bit,'' she said.
You are nearly 90 years old. Does the idea of death bother you?No. It is only logical. Without death, there wouldn't be life. I was given my life, those two and a half billion seconds: Young man, decide what you want to do with it. I did some reckoning, and I decided to do something with those seconds, to make a difference, to affect the lives of millions of people. I think I decided correctly. I got my life as a gift. I'll give it up without an overdraft.
Will you live to see peace in the Middle East?I think and believe so. If I have another 10 years to live, I am sure that I will have the privilege of seeing peace come even to this dismal and wonderful and amazing part of the world.

The Mistfits

BYLINE: By STEPHEN RODRICK

SECTION: Section MM; Column 0; Magazine Desk; Pg. 22

LENGTH: 7185 words

Lindsay Lohan moves through the Chateau Marmont as if she owns the place, but in a debtor-prison kind of way. She'll soon owe the hotel $46,000. Heads turn subtly as she slinks toward a table to meet a young producer and an old director. The actress's mother, Dina Lohan, sits at the next table. Mom sweeps blond hair behind her ear and tries to eavesdrop. A few tables away, a distinguished-looking middle-aged man patiently waits for the actress. He has a stack of presents for her.
Lohan sits down, smiles and skips the small talk.
''Hi, how are you? I won't play Cynthia. I want to play Tara, the lead.'' Braxton Pope and Paul Schrader nod happily. They'd been tipped off by her agent that this was how it was going to go. They tell her that sounds like a great idea. 
Schrader thinks she's perfect for the role. Not everyone agrees. Schrader wrote ''Raging Bull'' and ''Taxi Driver'' and has directed 17 films. Still, some fear Lohan will end him. There have been house arrests, car crashes and ingested white powders. His own daughter begs him not to use her. A casting-director friend stops their conversation whenever he mentions her name. And then there's the film's explicit subject matter. Full nudity and lots of sex. Definitely NC-17. His wife, the actress Mary Beth Hurt, didn't even finish the script, dismissing it as pornography after 50 pages. She couldn't understand why he wanted it so badly.
But Schrader was running out of chances. His last major opportunity was about a decade ago, when he was picked to direct a reboot of ''The Exorcist.'' He told an interviewer, ''If I don't completely screw that up, it might be possible for me to end my career standing on my own feet rather than groveling for coins.'' A few months later, he was replaced by the blockbuster director Renny Harlin, who reshot the film. Renny Harlin! Schrader is now 65 and still begging for coins.
Pope, dressed in a checked shirt and skinny tie, looks like a producer. His fingers are constantly, frantically, scanning his iPhone. In the fall of 2011, he connected Schrader with Bret Easton Ellis, whose grisly satires brought him early notoriety and who had lately turned to screenwriting. The three were set to make ''Bait,'' a shark thriller, based on a screenplay Ellis wrote, but the Spanish financing vaporized. Schrader suggested they do something on the cheap that didn't look cheap. Pope worked his connections with Lohan's agent, and that's why she is sitting here on this spring day.
Ellis is noticeably absent, holed up less than a mile away waging one of his frequent Twitter wars. (He has mounted social-media jihads against David Foster Wallace, J. D. Salinger and Kathryn Bigelow.) He thinks Lohan is wrong for the part, especially if she's cast opposite the porn star he courted online. But he spent all his capital getting his man cast. Also, his condo is under water. Ellis will give in.
Schrader, Pope and Lohan talk details. The film, ''The Canyons,'' has a microbudget, maybe $250,000. Ellis, Pope and Schrader are putting up $30,000 apiece. The rest will be raised on Kickstarter with promises of cameos, script reviews and -- for the low, low price of $10,000 -- the money clip that Robert DeNiro gave Schrader on the set of ''Taxi Driver.'' There will be no studio looking over their shoulders offering idiot notes. The actress will get $100 a day and an equal share of the profits, but no vote in decision-making. This last clause is nonnegotiable.
Schrader goes over some ground rules; no trailers on set and one contractually obligated, four-way sex scene. Oh, another thing, Schrader adds: he will not try to sleep with her. This was probably a more relevant point in 1982, but no matter. Lohan stands up and says goodbye, telling everyone how excited she is to be working with them. She leaves the restaurant, followed by her mother and the mysterious man with the presents.
Back at the table, Pope straightens his tie and exhales. He turns to Schrader and asks a simple question.
''What do you think?''
Schrader knows he should be terrified, but he's as giddy as the son of dour Calvinists can be.
''I think this is going to work.''
If Schrader wasn't worried about Lohan's reputation, it might be because he is familiar with dysfunction. As a boy, his mother showed him what hell felt like by shoving a needle into his thumb. His father lobbied to prevent ''The Last Temptation of Christ,'' a film his son wrote, from playing in their hometown, Grand Rapids, Mich. After his father died, Schrader found that he owned VHS tapes of all of his films, but none of them had been opened. In his 20s, Schrader slept with a gun under his pillow because he could fall asleep only if he knew there was a way out. Now he never travels without thousands of dollars in the currency of half a dozen countries.
Schrader is convinced he can manage Lohan. He thinks he has seen it all. Thirty years ago, he directed an alcoholic George C. Scott in ''Hardcore.'' One day, Scott wouldn't come out of his trailer. He called Schrader into his booze-soaked sanctuary.
''You're a great screenwriter but the world's worst goddamned director,'' Scott said. ''Promise me you'll never direct another movie, and I'll come out.'' Schrader dropped to his knees and promised. A few weeks later, Scott read in the trades that Schrader was going to direct ''American Gigolo.'' Next time he saw Schrader, he bellowed, ''You're a liar.''
It was true, Schrader had broken his promise, but this was Hollywood. Manipulating someone like Scott -- or Lohan -- was his vocation. Still, it wouldn't be easy. At their second meeting, Lohan complained to Schrader about a biopic she was shooting for Lifetime, in which she played Elizabeth Taylor, one of her role models. She proclaimed the director a jerk, her co-star a nightmare and the crew unfriendly. On it went. Schrader listened for a while. He looked stricken. He softly tapped his balding head on the table. Lohan asked him what was the matter.
''That's going to be me in two months. You're going to turn on me.''
The actress touched his arm softly. ''C'mon, Paul. That won't happen.''
He chose to believe her. That summer, he developed a pet line to steel the less brave.
''We don't have to save her,'' Schrader said. ''We just have to get her through three weeks in July.''
A month later, Schrader would be standing naked in a Malibu bedroom, missing his dogs and trying to coax Lohan out of her robe.
Turns out three weeks can be a very long time.
I first met Schrader in 2009 while he was trying to get a combined Bollywood-Hollywood thriller starring Leonardo DiCaprio made. ''This is the future of filmmaking,'' Schrader told me over lunch in Manhattan. ''Global financing. The American market is tapped out.''
But the Indian money dried up, and DiCaprio lost interest. The film slipped away. By 2011, Schrader, who built his career on making movies about dark loners, was convinced that traditional financing for the films he liked to make was gone forever, along with the audience willing to drive five miles and pay $12 to watch them in a drafty art house. Well, the audience was still there, but they were at home. He thought his future lay in pictures that would not only play indie theaters but also be available on video-on-demand the same day. Recent movies like ''Bachelorette,'' with Kirsten Dunst, and ''Arbitrage,'' a Richard Gere thriller, made a comfortable profit that way. Schrader hoped to follow that model, but on a skimpier budget. He wrote his two partners a manifesto of sorts last January:
''The script has to be multicharactered, relationship-based, full of sharp dialogue, set in contemporary locations and have a certain outrי value. . . . Cinema for the posttheatrical era. . . . We could attract interesting actors and create a profile for the film via social media. It would be something that we own.''
Like Schrader, Ellis was at a crossroads. After his early successes, ''Less Than Zero'' and ''American Psycho,'' Ellis's books hadn't sold as well, and tired of the novel as an art form, he moved to L.A., looking to break into movies. But nothing had gone into production recently, and he was itching to get something made. He went to work on the script while Pope strategized.
Schrader could talk a good game, but it was Pope who would have to implement the plan. Pope suggested making ''The Canyons'' the most open film ever. There would be daily Facebook updates, and the cast would be made up entirely of actors selected from audition tapes sent to the movie's Web site. Pope argued that this populist approach could be applied to financing as well. He explained Kickstarter to Schrader: all they had to do was come up with some good prizes, and kids of all ages would pledge money online to be associated with artist outlaws like Schrader and Ellis. Soon, the film was offering donors a Schrader script-critique for $5,001 and a week working out with Ellis and his trainer for $3,000. In a month, they raised more than $150,000.
Ellis cranked out a first draft in six weeks. He had recently become fascinated with James Deen, a 26-year-old known as the Porn Star Next Door. Deen, whose real name is Bryan Matthew Sevilla, is the Jewish son of Pasadena rocket scientists -- really. His 4,000 films have gained him a cult of female fans because he is well endowed and sensitive. But Ellis didn't see Deen as harmless. He wrote the script with Deen in his head for the role of Christian, a classic Ellis sociopathic trust-funder, convinced there ''was a devil behind the Jewish boy-next-door cute guy.''
Ellis's Christian liked to bring men and women to his Malibu mansion for sex with Tara, his emotionally and economically dependent girlfriend. Christian and Tara would be caught in a sordid triangle with Ryan, a not-bright but cunning pretty-boy actor. There would be sex and a murder and more sex.
Ellis and Deen exchanged flirty tweets as he wrote and the two met for dinner at Soho House in Los Angeles. Afterward, Ellis was even more convinced that Deen was perfect for Christian. Schrader had his doubts, concerned about trying to break bad habits learned over thousands of porn movies. Ellis countered that the other actors read the part with a certain campiness; only Deen read it with the correct malevolence. Eventually, Schrader showed tapes of the three finalists to his wife at their upstate New York home. Hurt told her husband that Deen was the one.
Around the same time, Pope reached out to Lohan. Ellis was skeptical, afraid of the melodrama Lohan would bring to the project. But Pope and Schrader reminded Ellis of what he said in an essay for The Daily Beast the previous year: ''Do [Americans] really want manners? Civility? Empire courtesy? No. They want reality, no matter how crazy the celeb who brings it on has become.''
Ellis was riffing on Charlie Sheen, but it could have been Lohan. The first child of a drug-abusing, felonious stock trader and a failed dancer, Lohan survived her Long Island childhood, moved to Hollywood and became America's newest sweetheart with winning turns in ''The Parent Trap'' and ''Mean Girls.'' She cut an album that went platinum. In 2006, she was the best thing in Robert Altman's ''Prairie Home Companion.'' The future was hers to write.
Then -- as the voice-over in an ''E! True Hollywood Story'' would put it -- it all fell apart. Big-budget films need insurance in case an actress dies or becomes incapacitated and can't go on with a role. Lohan's misadventures made her uninsurable, her work dried up and she settled in as a generation's snarky punch line.
But Pope thought the talent was still there. (She would make it through ''Liz and Dick,'' a Lifetime movie, with the paramedics having to be called only once during the shoot. This was progress.) Besides, ''The Canyons'' was so low-budget that they didn't need insurance. If she disappeared, Pope, Ellis and Schrader would simply lose their stake.
Lohan helped her cause by agreeing to a screen test. You could see playing Tara wouldn't be a stretch for her. The large green eyes that read cute a decade ago now conveyed cornered desperation. Of course, casting two known quantities blew up the anyone-can-win, D.I.Y. ethos of the project, but nobody asked for his money back.
A few months after the Chateau Marmont meeting, the cast gathered at Prettybird studios in Culver City for the first read-through of the script. At the head of the table was Schrader, with Ellis to his left. Pope sat at the far end. The actors filtered in and took their seats. There was just one missing: Lohan.
Schrader welcomed everyone and then opened with: ''Lindsay said she couldn't make it today, and I told her that was fine, but I have an actress in Paris waiting by the phone.'' He paused, and the room tittered. ''She's on her way.''
Killing time, Deen kept looking at his phone. Meanwhile, Nolan Funk -- a pompadoured Canadian cast to play the weak link in the film's love triangle -- scrunched his brow and read the script quietly to himself. About 20 minutes later, Lohan arrived with a tiny assistant in tow. She smiled nervously and took her seat, adjusting her floral peasant shirt, rattling her bangles.
''Hi, everybody.''
Schrader gave her an impatient paternal look and then started talking about the film. But Ellis and Funk were distracted. Across the table, Funk could see that his name had been crossed out in Lohan's script and underneath were the names of three or four actors as possible replacements. Ellis saw that Deen's name also had a line through it.
Lohan's private doubts did not diminish her public enthusiasm. She had a thousand thoughts on Tara. Schrader mentioned the character was a failed actress.
''Rejection for an actress is formative.''
Lohan snorted a laugh.
''Well, it's nothing like going to jail, I can tell you that.''
The usually poker-faced Ellis cracked a wry smile.
''Well, that's also formative.''
Schrader mentioned that he was still trying to cast a psychiatrist, a small but pivotal role.
''I called Jeff Goldblum and Willem Dafoe. They're not available. So, any ideas?''
Lohan squealed and said, ''How about Jared?''
Schrader nodded approvingly.
''Jared Harris?''
''No, Jared Leto.''
Pope grimaced. (Schrader eventually cast Gus Van Sant.)
Around 3, Schrader said that was enough for the day. Lohan bolted out of her chair and headed outside for a smoke. She was quite pale, her skin not on speaking terms with daylight. But she was excited to be working.
''I've missed this so much,'' she said between puffs. Her voice was a nicotine-soaked rasp. ''I'm in a good place now. I mean it's Bret Easton Ellis and Paul Schrader! It's a dream. When it's done, I want to go somewhere far away, maybe Africa. Uganda? But right now all I want to do is work, work.''
Lohan oozed adrenaline and chattered on with a self-lacerating sense of humor. (She owns coasters that say, ''I used to worry, but now I have a pill for that.'') She talked of a recent photo shoot where she was asked to wear stripes. She shifted into her best Joan Rivers imitation.
''I said, 'Hello, stripes after jail, so not a good idea!' ''
A few minutes later, she said goodbye and hobbled in heels toward her rented Porsche.
Then she disappeared for a few days.
Filming was scheduled to start in less than a week, so Schrader arranged for Deen and Lohan to meet him at Prettybird to map out the movie's sex scenes. Lohan canceled the first day but promised she'd be there the next morning, a Sunday. She never showed. Schrader and Pope texted and left messages on her phone. There was no answer. Schrader thought about what he should do. Right now, he had the upper hand; there really was an actress waiting in Paris. But once they started shooting, he'd lose the power. Lohan could hold the entire production hostage. So he fired her.
He went back to his room at the Orlando Hotel in Beverly Hills and left it to Pope to deliver the bad news. Pope finally reached Lohan, telling her she was done. Lohan began to cry and begged for another chance. Pope told her that Schrader had made up his mind.
Lohan headed for the Orlando. She pounded on doors until she found Schrader's room. As she banged on his door, she texted him manically. Schrader could hear her crying but wouldn't let her in. He texted her instead.
''Lindsay, go home.''
The hotel manager rang up to ask if he should call the cops. Schrader told him no and sat down on his bed. Lohan stayed out in the hall sobbing for another 90 minutes before she finally left.
Eventually, the director called Pope and asked him to gather everyone at Prettybird to watch Lohan's and the French actress's screen tests again. Everyone agreed that Lohan was exponentially better. Schrader decided he'd give her one more chance.
Some in the production thought this was Schrader's endgame all along: a strategy to get her back in line. That night, Pope, Lohan and Schrader met at the Churchill, a bar at the Orlando. A waiter brought them drinks -- coffee for Lohan, a Manhattan for Schrader, a vodka soda for Pope. A pall settled over the table. Finally, Schrader picked up his glass.
''I need a drink!''
Lohan laughed and wiped tears from her eyes. She explained that she missed the meeting at Prettybird because she had been discussing the script with Nolan Funk until 3 a.m. and then took a sleeping pill. Schrader laid down the law: one more meltdown, and she was gone. If she thought she was unhirable now, wait until he threw her off a microbudget.
Schrader thought Lohan's weakness wasn't drugs -- although he counseled her on the math of when to take sleep aids -- but fear of being alone. She needed people and chaos around her 24/7. The idea of being by herself scared the hell out of her.
The next day, Lohan arrived relatively on time for a makeup test. She sat behind a table with a can of Sprite, looked into the camera and flashed a wholesome smile that would not have been out of place in the world's best soda commercial. Schrader grabbed my arm and pointed at Lohan's image.
''See? That's why we put up with all the crap. You can shoot bad movies with actresses who are always on time. But look! The rest is just noise.''
But there was always noise. A few days later, filming started at 3 a.m. at the plush bar attached to the Chateau Marmont, which Pope had scored free. It wasn't an easy first day. The scene was the opening six minutes of the movie, and there was too much exposition and not enough action. But Pope had another concern.
''Her makeup looks like it's from a different movie.''
It was true; Lohan's visage had a Kabuki quality to it. She had chosen to wear layers of mascara and catlike eye makeup with black lines pointing out toward her ears. Before the shoot, Pope showed Lohan Polaroids of her looking beautiful with minimal makeup.
''Look, our interest is in making you look great,'' Pope told her. ''You look beautiful with just a little makeup.''
But Lohan was trying to put her pixieish Disney days behind her and thought the Courtney Love approach made her look hip.
Pope let it go. There were only so many battles you could fight.
The trick of ''The Canyons'' was to make a $250,000 movie look like a $10 million movie. Fortunately, Schrader's reputation inspired the kinds of donations someone straight out of film school was unlikely to get. One Kickstarter donor gave $10,000 to the production and another $10,000 to a designer so that Schrader could use his beautiful house in the Malibu hills for filming. It was a significant break; the house was a stately pleasure dome with giant picture windows, a stairway leading to a pool and a sweeping view to the sea.
It quickly became the most dependable player in the film after James Deen. On the first day of shooting in Malibu, Deen aw-shucked his way around the predominantly male crew. He wasn't a big man; maybe 5-8 and 150 pounds, but they regarded him with wonder. At lunch, a crew member asked the question on everyone's mind.
''Man, how many women have you had sex with?''
Deen just laughed and sheepishly scratched his head.
''Dude, I have no idea. Seriously.''
Deen has worked in all aspects of porn: producing, directing and acting. As a teenager, he learned to be comfortable performing for a crowd by ''getting freaky'' with a girl in front of his friends before moving into another room, as a way of getting comfortable with having sex in public. Once he began working, he took pride in being professional: he was never late, and his behavior was always fastidious. (He could be seen on set making sure the garbage bags were correctly hugging the trash-can lids.) But there was a certain loneliness about him. He told me that his lawyer, a bearded Gandalfian figure, was one of his best friends. On the ''Canyons'' set, he was the sole cast member who never had pals stop by.
Only Lohan had a visitor on that first Malibu day. It was Steve Honig, her publicist, a stubby, bald man in a denim shirt. He told Schrader having a reporter on set was unacceptable. Schrader told Honig that he understood and that if he wanted to pull Lohan from the movie, he should do so. Honig backed down. Honig and I talked for a few minutes while the crew waited for the marine layer to lift.
''I don't want this to be all about Lindsay being late,'' Honig said. ''Actresses are always late. Julia Roberts is late.''
A few hours later, the production broke for lunch. Lohan announced she wanted to grab a bite somewhere on the Pacific Coast Highway. This concerned Pope and Schrader -- they could monitor her only as long as they could see her -- so they dispatched the co-producer, Ricky Horne Jr., to chauffeur Honig, Lohan and her assistants to wherever they wanted to go.
Horne drove them down the hill, pausing at a security gate. That's when his passengers did a jailbreak, jumping out of his car. Honig frantically pushed buttons until the gate opened and the four of them dashed for Lohan's assistant's car. Horne sat, baffled for a moment, before heading back up the hill and briefing Schrader. The director was furious.
''O.K., she's lost the privilege of leaving for lunch. She stays here.''
Lohan returned, only 15 minutes late, emerging from makeup to an angry Schrader. They spent much of the afternoon arguing about continuity.
''Lindsay, you held the cigarette up in the last take, now you have it down. Let's do it again.''
Lohan sighed. Now that shooting had begun, she had the power.
''Sorry, Paul, I guess you'll have to fire me again.''
By midweek, Schrader and Lohan were locked in battle. One afternoon, he shot some of the lead-up to the movie's pivotal sex scene. Lohan wasn't happy.
''I hope you got my triple chin on that one,'' Lohan said to no one directly. ''That shot was hideous.''
Later that afternoon, it was time to rehearse a fight scene in which Christian physically confronts Tara over infidelity. Schrader tried to describe to Deen how he wanted him to throw Lohan to the ground. Deen nodded and went through the scene at half-speed. (It was a constant friction point between the two actors, Deen conserving his energy and Lohan demanding full effort in rehearsals.) After a while, Schrader cut in to show Deen what he wanted, lightly moving Lohan and turning her toward the floor.
''James, you see that?''
Deen nodded, but Schrader wasn't convinced. So he grabbed Lohan, tripped her over his left leg and body-slammed her to the floor. Lohan screamed, and the crew gasped. But she bounced up with a smile.
''That was great! Want to do it again?''
Schrader said it wouldn't be necessary. The next morning they filmed the scene for real. Deen came to life; throwing the negligיe-wearing Lohan hard to the ground and pounding his fist into a wall with such fury I wondered if he had broken his hand. Lohan lay slumped on the floor, her hands guarding her face, shoulders shaking, tears pouring down her cheeks. Between takes, she listened to Ryan Adams's cover of ''Wonderwall.'' After three shots, Schrader said he was satisfied, and Lohan fumbled for a cigarette. She headed downstairs, and someone complimented her work.
''Well, I've got a lot of experience with that from my dad.''
She didn't elaborate, and no one asked.
The next night, the ''Canyons'' crew was cut to a minimum. It was time to film the four-way. The scene comes at a crucial moment in the movie, when the usually passive Tara turns the tables on Christian and forces him out of his sexual comfort zone. Filmed incorrectly, the scene might win a Razzie. Get it right, and the rest of the film would click into place.
Pope found two porn actors to play the other participants. The woman walked through rehearsal completely naked, bragging that she refused to conform to porn's norms and shave her pubic hair. Lohan freaked out.
''God, I so don't need to hear about that.''
She retreated to a walk-in closet a few feet from the bed where the scene would be shot. Lohan had just fired her assistant and was now holed up with an old friend named Gavin. Schrader waited a half-hour and then went to see if Lohan was ready to shoot. Gavin explained that Lohan was uneasy working with porn stars and actually, truth be told, was uneasy working with Deen.
Schrader lost it.
''The thing that's going to explode from this film is James Deen!''
Lohan screamed from the back of the closet.
''That's what I'm afraid of!''
Schrader stalked away. He waited another hour. He went back to talk to Lohan again, this time as bad cop. Gavin wouldn't let him all the way in, so he yelled through the door.
''You signed the contract. You knew this was coming!''
Another hour passed, and Lohan eventually moved to the bed but wouldn't remove her robe. Schrader worried that the early-morning sunlight would begin streaming through the house. He thought of sending everyone home. But then he realized that there was one thing he hadn't yet tried. He stripped off all of his clothes. Naked, he walked toward Lohan.
''Lins, I want you to be comfortable. C'mon, let's do this.''
Lohan shrieked.
''Paul!''
Pope heard the scream and ran up from downstairs. He turned a corner, and there was a naked Schrader. Pope let out a ''whoa'' and slowly backed out of the room.
But then a funny thing happened. Lohan dropped her robe. Schrader shouted action, and they filmed the scene in one 14-minute take. About halfway through, Lohan looked directly into the camera and flashed a dirty, demented smile at Schrader. He smiled back.
A few minutes later, Schrader yelled cut. The crew packed up. Pope went to check on Lohan. He noticed that she and Gavin had been drinking, which was understandable for a young woman shooting a sex scene with three porn stars. Quietly, Pope told Lohan that he could get her a driver to take her home. But she refused, jumped into her Porsche and headed down the dark, narrow road toward the P.C.H. They all hoped they would still have a lead actress in the morning.
The next evening, around 6 p.m., Lohan barreled back up the hill. It was the last day the production had the Malibu house, and there were still two essential scenes left. The first one was the movie's emotional payoff: Tara leaving Christian and Christian letting her go in exchange for a lethal favor.
The scene was to be shot at ''magic hour,'' the hour before sunset, and as usual, Lohan was running late. It had been an endless week of switching day for night, and everyone was on edge, including Deen. He had reached his limit with Lohan. During rehearsal, Deen and Schrader argued loudly over how Deen was playing the scene. After Deen remarked for the fourth time that he disagreed with how the scene unfolded, Schrader screamed at him. ''James [expletive ]Deen, play the scene as I goddamn tell you.''
The two stepped outside and talked for a minute and came back in with sheepish grins. (Later Deen told me, ''We yelled at each other because we couldn't yell at the person we both wanted to yell at.'') Lohan shook her head disapprovingly at Deen.
''That's unprofessional to treat your director like that. Just very disrespectful.''
The light faded while Lohan gave a running commentary on how the scene should be played, which happened to be the exact opposite of what Schrader wanted. She finally stopped talking and turned to the director.
''Paul, how do you want to play this?''
Schrader sighed.
''I was hoping to direct the scene, but it's apparent that you're not going to let me. Let's skip it. It's too late, the light is lost.''
Pope rushed in and put his arm on Schrader's shoulder.
''Let's give it a shot.''
Miraculously, the cameras rolled, and all the tension, all the ego, all the incoherence exploded into the film's most riveting scene: Deen, cold and evil; Lohan, vulnerable and afraid.
All that remained was to get a close-up of Deen touching Lohan's face with a blood-streaked finger. Only half of Lohan's face would be in the shot. Most actresses would pop in some Visine to well their eyes with tears and be done with it. Instead, Lohan went back to her room, and everyone waited.
I was standing by her door, and soon I could hear her crying. It began quietly, almost a whimper, but rose to a guttural howl. It was the sobbing of a child lost in the woods.
She came out of her room, and I watched the shot on a monitor. Now, without the garish makeup, Lohan looked sadly beautiful, and it was easy to see why men like Schrader were willing to put their lives in her hands. The camera rolled, and Deen moved in slowly to touch her face. Then Schrader cursed.
''That blood looks completely fake. It's supposed to look hours old, and it looks fresh. We'll have to fix it in post. We're done.''
After dinner, Lohan emerged changed -- wobbly and happy, a playful smile on her face. Schrader tried to talk her through the next scene -- a confrontation with Christian over his possibly criminal behavior -- but she kept stumbling and giggling, missing her mark by a wide margin. Schrader told everyone to take 15 minutes. He turned to me and shrugged. ''If she wants to treat this like 'The Real Housewives' of Beverly Hills, I'll shoot it like 'The Real Housewives.' ''
Schrader told the crew they'd shoot the rest of the scene with hand-held cameras. That way, wherever Lohan was standing would be her mark. As equipment was reset, Lohan retreated to the patio for a smoke. She still had her mike on, so anyone wearing headphones could hear her.
''I've got one assistant passed out at my house and the other one in the Palisades saying he wants to hang himself. Life's great.''
She exhaled, stubbed out her cigarette and came back inside. Schrader shot the scene for another hour, cursing under his breath as Lohan eye-rolled him from the staircase.
Lohan asked for a quick makeup break and retreated to her room. Schrader popped in for a word and then came out with a mischievous look on his face.
''Do you know that iPhone app that makes explosions?''
He held up the phone and showed me some footage he'd just shot of Lohan having her makeup redone. Then he pushed a button, and a Bruckheimer-quality explosion blew his star into a million tiny pieces.
Schrader smiled for the first time all night. He started talking about ''The Misfits,'' a 1961 film written by Arthur Miller and directed by John Huston. The film featured the final performances of both Clark Gable and Marilyn Monroe. The shoot was torturous, 50 days morphing into 90, with Monroe spending a week in the hospital during filming.
''We're making 'The Misfits' on a microbudget,'' Schrader joked. He scratched his head and arched his eyebrows. ''But here's the thing: 'The Misfits' is actually a great film.''
Schrader was getting cocky. For all his disputes with Lohan, filming was on schedule; Lohan hadn't missed any days.
''We're getting close to the point where if she disappeared, we still have a movie,'' Schrader told me one weekend midshoot. ''Just one more full day, and we're good.''
That's when things started to get really weird. Lady Gaga was now staying at the Chateau, and that wasn't great news for ''The Canyons.'' Lohan missed her morning call, and then she left the shoot for lunch with friends, running up a $600 tab on sushi, sake and vodka.
''I don't think she gets it,'' Pope said. ''Six hundred dollars is huge on this movie. That's six guys' pay for the day.''
The next morning, Lohan was scheduled to shoot at Cafי Med, a West Hollywood restaurant. But when I arrived, Pope was on the verge of panic.
''Lindsay was out with Lady Gaga till 5:30 a.m. Her call was 6 a.m.''
By 9 a.m., Lohan was lying down in a Cafי Med booth with her hands over her eyes shading them from imaginary sunlight. The production had the restaurant only until 11. Schrader paced, breathing heavily.
A doctor arrived and took Lohan's blood pressure. He walked over to Pope and Schrader. His diagnosis: An inner-ear infection. She was done for the day. Schrader didn't buy it.
''That's her doctor, he'll say whatever she wants. I shot one day from a stretcher. She could do it, but she doesn't want to.''
Pope and Schrader huddled with the production crew and thought of scenes they could shoot that day as a substitute. ''What do we have left for James?'' Schrader asked
There was awkward silence before a producer chimed in.
''Uh, I was driving by Burbank airport yesterday and I saw James pulling into the airport.''
A call was placed. Deen admitted he was not in Los Angeles.
''Goddamn it,'' Schrader said. ''He agreed not to shoot porn during the shoot. Now he's out of town making porn. I told him things could change; he had to stay in town. Now a whole day is wasted.''
The crew moved on to other scenes while Lohan recuperated from the Lady Gaga flu. The stress of the shoot was wearing on everyone; the crew hadn't been paid in a week. Pope, hoping to buck up morale, suggested raffling off two Samsung tablets used in the film. Schrader -- whom the crew nicknamed the dyspeptic Lorax -- wasn't onboard.
''I don't have a tablet. I'd like one of them.''
The next morning, everyone reconvened at Cafי Med. Lohan was almost on time. A TMZ tour bus drove by, the passengers waving and snapping pictures. During a camera change, I talked to Lohan as she smoked a cigarette in the parking lot. It was just dawning on her that the film was almost over. She seemed genuinely heartbroken.
''I needed time to figure out all the crap in my life that I'd created for myself, essentially, and I kind of realized, What am I doing? I like doing this. I like being here. This makes me happy. There was a line in the 'Elizabeth' movie where she says, 'I'm so bored, I've never been taught what to do when I'm not working,' and I'm kind of figuring that out now.''
Lohan wore a floppy hat to protect her skin from the sun and halfheartedly waved to two photographers snapping from a hill 20 yards away. I reminded her that she said she wanted to go to Africa after the shoot was over. Was she still going? She shook her head; she'd changed her mind.
''I don't want to take a while off, I want to keep working. There's some other scripts, and I eventually want to direct, so maybe when I'm not filming, I can be directing something because I learned so much from the people that I worked with.''
I mentioned the scene at the house where she dissolved into tears. I may have said that she still had a gift and that it shouldn't be squandered. Lohan's eyes filled.
''I know. I'm trying. I'm really trying.''
But then she shook her head.
''I can't cry. I've got makeup on.''
There was just one last shot. The film's producers negotiated a deal with the Loews Hotel in Santa Monica for the use of a suite where they could get ready for the scene. It was going to be a tricky one; the script called for Lohan to be followed by a stalker as she shopped at the Santa Monica Promenade. The only problem was that the mall wanted $10,000 for permission to shoot, and ''The Canyons'' didn't have it. So they went with a risky move: filming one of America's most recognizable faces walking through a crowded mall with hand-held cameras.
Schrader was already scouting the location by the time Lohan arrived at the suite with her entourage. She smiled and waved to everyone and then noticed a magazine with Oliver Stone on the cover. She picked it up and ripped it into pieces, cursing. (Lohan had been considered for a role in Stone's ''Savages,'' but the director eventually passed.) She then went into the bedroom, calling out, ''Does anyone want a beer?'' Then she popped back out.
''The minibar is empty. Now that's interesting!''
Over at the mall, Schrader paced nervously. ''We need to get three shots, and we're not going to get a second chance.'' He was worried about attracting the attention of mall security. An hour later, Lohan arrived in her black Porsche trailed by four or five paparazzi. Schrader threw up his hands and said, ''That's it.''
Lohan told him, politely, to shut up.
''Paul, we can do this.''
She climbed out of her car and turned to the photographers.
''I'll make a deal with you. I'll give you a good shot, but then you have to go.'' Lohan turned to her good side and hiked her floor-length skirt up to show a little leg.
''O.K., five, four, three, two, one. Now you have to go.''
The photographers backed away. Lohan walked into the mall, and Schrader started shooting. But they were quickly apprehended by the matronly head of mall security.
''You have to stop.''
Lohan flashed an innocent smile.
''He's just taking stills. I promise.''
The matron snorted.
''You were wearing the same outfit when you were filming upstairs at Sonoma Wine Garden last week. You have to stop.''
It was over. Defeated, Schrader headed back to the hotel. Lohan walked to her Porsche. Gavin was behind the wheel. She told me to get in the back. Just before we hit the security gate, a photographer jumped out of the dark. Lohan screamed at him.
''You're a liar!''
The photographer shrugged.
''My camera jammed before.''
Lohan gave him the finger, and we pulled onto the freeway.
''I lost a bunch in traffic on the way over to Loews. Then when I got to the Loews, there were more, and it was completely different cars, it was X17 and Splash,'' Lohan said, speaking rapidly. The paparazzi chase had animated her in a way I hadn't seen before. ''They were already waiting at the hotel, they were already there.''
I asked why she didn't try a less conspicuous vehicle.
''I've tried everything, I would wear wigs . . . we've had Wranglers, old Cadillacs -- I've tried everything.''
Lohan yelled at Gavin to make a turn, but he missed it. She sighed dramatically but didn't seem really bothered.
''It's just creepy. I've gotten people ask to pay me 25 to 30 for a shot or sometimes 50 thousand for a bathing-suit shot. I'm afraid they'd put trackers on my car, which God only knows. . . . ''
Back at the Loews, Schrader and Pope were debating what to do next. Lohan suggested shooting the scene at the Grove, a tony West Hollywood shopping center.
''Look, we can shoot at the Grove, and we can get it for free.''
Pope looked at her with confusion.
''We'll have 'Access Hollywood' pay for it. They'll film it, I'll answer three questions about the movie and then they'll pay for it. It's really easy.''
Pope and Schrader were unconvinced. But Lohan was insistent as she left the room. ''They'll do it. You just have to know how to work it.''
A few days later, Schrader and Pope, having decided on a more conventional approach, filmed Lohan at the Century City Mall, paying $3,000 for the privilege.
And just like that, the film was done. Schrader told me it would take six weeks to edit, but after three weeks I got an e-mail saying it was nearly finished. I met him in a small editing room on the top floor of the Brill Building in New York, where a half-dozen of Schrader's friends from the indie film industry had gathered. He popped in a DVD.
The opening scene dragged endlessly. Some tricky camerawork that Schrader threw in to break up the monotony only emphasized the deadness of the scene. As Pope feared, Lohan's makeup made her look as if she'd walked onto the set from an entirely different film.
But about 15 minutes in, something clicked. Deen had a quiet malevolence. Ellis was right: he was born to play a Bret Easton Ellis character. Lohan was equal parts vulnerable and dissolute.
Afterward, Schrader's friends were noncommittal, but Schrader was ecstatic. We adjourned to a nearby bar. He was certain the film would get into the Sundance Film Festival. Maybe they'd recoup their investment tenfold.
''We thought this was going to be 'My Dinner With Andre,' but it's a real film. We [expletive] did it.''
But this was ''The Canyons,'' so the ending couldn't be that smooth. I flew back to Los Angeles and watched the film a few days later with Ellis and Pope. Ellis was the least impressed.
''The film is so languorous. It's an hour 30, and it seems like it's three hours long. I saw this as a pranky noirish thriller, but Schrader turned it into, well, a Schrader film.''
Pope and Ellis agreed that the opening scene wasn't working. Pope called Schrader about reshooting it, and he was angrily dismissed.
''We could shoot it again for $15,000 in a day,'' Pope said. Then he corrected himself. ''Well, with Lindsay, we'd have to budget two days, but it's doable. But he won't do it.''
He was right. Schrader wouldn't hear of it. And for good reason. It took two months and the quasi intervention of Lohan's father to get Lohan to finish two hours of looping for the outdoor scenes. In the interim, Lohan punched a psychic, was accused of hitting a pedestrian in New York, was under investigation by the I.R.S. and watched her parents melt down on a very special episode of ''Dr. Phil.''
Meanwhile, Ellis, Pope and Schrader battled over the film's final cut. Pope screened a rough cut of ''The Canyons'' for Steven Soderbergh. Intrigued, Soderbergh offered to do an edit of the movie if he was given the footage for 72 hours.
Schrader said no.
I met him one last time in Toronto, where he was working on the film's soundtrack with the Canadian musician Brendan Canning. He had just learned that the film had not been accepted by Sundance -- the film is scheduled to be put up for sale by William Morris Endeavor later this month -- and was in a fouler-than-usual mood.
''The idea of 72 hours is a joke,'' Schrader said. ''It would take him 72 hours to look at all the footage. And you know what Soderbergh would do if another director offered to cut his film?''
I said I didn't. Schrader leaned back in his chair and gave me two middle fingers.
''That's what Soderbergh would do.''
Inevitably, our conversation turned back to Lohan. He showed the film to Lindsay and her mother, Dina, in October at his New York City apartment. They were both so furious about how the camera lingered on Deen that Schrader had to move Dina to another room to get through the screening.
I asked Schrader if he regretted casting Lohan. He shook his head.
''No, she's great in the film.''
Schrader then told me a secret. Until the screening disaster, Schrader had been in talks with Lohan to star in a remake of John Cassavetes's ''Gloria,'' about a woman on the run from the mob. The director lighted up, childlike; hope triumphing over memories of being stripped naked.
''It doesn't involve a co-star. She would be perfect for it.''

Afghans Killed After Allies Target Taliban

BYLINE: By ALISSA J. RUBIN and SHARIFULLAH SAHAK

LENGTH: 542 words

KABUL, Afghanistan -- An explosion in a mountain village in eastern Afghanistan on Sunday killed at least seven civilians after a joint American-Afghan military raid killed four Taliban fighters there, Afghan officials said. But villagers said 16 civilians had been killed. 
A spokesman for the international coalition's forces said that an investigation was under way and that the explosion occurred after the Taliban fighters were killed. It was unclear what caused the explosion, but the villagers blamed the international forces.
The raid took place in the Tangi Valley, a remote area of Wardak Province, a Taliban-held region that has been dangerous for Americans. In 2011 it was the site of an insurgent attack that brought down a Chinook helicopter, killing all 30 Americans on board, including 22 members of the Navy SEALs. It was the largest single loss of American troops in the 11-year war. Eight Afghans on the helicopter also died.
In recent months, insurgent attacks have taken a toll on Afghan forces in the area. Thirty Afghan National Army soldiers have been killed in ambushes and explosions in the last 11 months, and another 70 have been wounded, said Maj. Saifuddin Zaffari, the Afghan Army's operational commander for the Fourth Brigade's Third Battalion, which has responsibility for the Tangi region.
In Sunday's raid, which occurred before dawn, a team of American and Afghan Special Operations forces detained a Taliban leader and then came under fire from Taliban gunmen who were hiding in a mosque. At least some of the Taliban were wearing suicide vests, which exploded during the fight, destroying the mosque, Afghan officials said.
''It was a joint ground operation in Hasan Khel village of Saidabad that killed four armed Taliban inside the mosque,'' Major Zaffari said. ''Some civilians were trying to collect the bodies or to get their weapons and other ammunition when suddenly a huge explosion took place and resulted in civilian casualties, but we don't know the exact numbers.''
A spokesman for the international forces, Lt. Col. Hagen Messer, said that early reports from villagers that there had been an airstrike were incorrect and that it was a ground operation that killed the Taliban.
''We also found a weapons and explosives cache and destroyed it before withdrawing,'' Colonel Messer said. He added, ''We are aware of reports that there may have been civilians killed.''
''If there were civilians killed,'' he said, ''it was after the operation.''
There were several theories about the cause of the explosion that killed the civilians. Shaheedullah Shaheed, a spokesman for the governor of Wardak Province, said that some explosives might have remained in the mosque after the raid and that they could have detonated when the civilians rushed in. Major Zaffari said the explosion might have occurred in a house next to the mosque.
An elder in the area, Juma Khan, who has Taliban ties and was in the village on Sunday morning, said that 16 villagers were killed and that their bodies were being prepared for burial. Of those, eight were older women and two were boys from the same family.
Zabiullah Mujahid, the Taliban spokesman for the north and east of Afghanistan, said that two Taliban had been killed in the raid.

Both Sides in Gun Debate Agree: Punish Background-Check Liars

BYLINE: By MICHAEL S. SCHMIDT; Michael D. Shear contributed reporting.

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 1290 words

WASHINGTON -- Nearly 80,000 Americans were denied guns in 2010, according to Justice Department data, because they lied or provided inaccurate information about their criminal histories on background-check forms. Yet only 44 of those people were charged with a crime.
The staggeringly low number of prosecutions for people who ''lie and try,'' as it is called by law enforcement officials, is being studied by the Obama administration as it considers measures to curb gun violence after the Connecticut elementary school shootings in December.
A task force headed by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is expected to offer proposals to President Obama as early as Tuesday. It is looking at a wide range of issues linked to gun crimes, including violence in video games and movies, and gaps in mental health treatment and background checks.
The most contentious initiatives, like reviving a ban on assault weapons, would require Congressional approval and have drawn fierce opposition from gun rights groups and Republican lawmakers, making passage a long shot. 
''I would say that the likelihood is that they are not going to be able to get an assault weapons ban through this Congress,'' David Keene, the president of the National Rifle Association, said Sunday on the CNN program ''State of the Union.''
In the face of those difficulties, the White House has said it is looking for actions it can take without Congressional approval. Increasing the number of prosecutions for lying on background-check forms is an effort that the administration can undertake largely on its own, in part by pressing federal prosecutors to pursue such cases. It is also one measure that both sides of the gun-control debate have agreed upon.
It is a felony to deliberately provide false information in an effort to buy a gun, and studies financed by the Justice Department show that people who do so are more likely than the average person to commit violent crimes after they are denied a firearm purchase.
At a meeting Mr. Biden held with gun control advocates on Wednesday, the group Mayors Against Illegal Guns recommended to the administration that it should instruct the Justice Department to investigate those who are denied guns and who have a history that suggests they might commit violence.
In a memorandum provided to the administration, the group suggested that ''armed career criminals who have at least three prior violent felonies and/or serious drug offenses and would qualify for a mandatory sentence of 7 to 15 years'' should be prosecuted if they lie on background-check forms. The group said that it provided a similar recommendation to the Obama administration in 2009.
The memorandum said that more than 800 mayors in the United States ''support more aggressive prosecution of those who fail background checks.''
''This is not like looking for a needle in a haystack -- these are people you know are too violent to buy a gun,'' John Feinblatt, an official with the mayors' group who met with Mr. Biden on Wednesday, said in a telephone interview. ''Once they have been rejected, they go online or to a private seller or a gun show and get a gun.''
The low number of prosecutions in 2010, the most recent year for which data are available, is consistent with other years. Prosecuting these cases has proved challenging because to get a conviction ''you have to prove that the person knew they were lying when they tried to purchase the firearm,'' said a senior Justice Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss matters related to gun control before Mr. Biden's proposals are announced.
A conviction usually carries a maximum sentence of just six months, the official said, adding that with a limited number of federal prosecutors the government has to prioritize its use of resources.
Although gun control advocates have been more vocal about the issue, the N.R.A. also supports similar action, arguing that the administration should enforce the gun laws that already exist before making new ones.
''It has been a longstanding frustration of the National Rifle Association that there's no follow-through or follow-up on these cases and criminals, and those who shouldn't be trying to buy guns have been getting away scot-free,'' said Andrew Arulanandam, an N.R.A. spokesman.
Mr. Arulanandam said that the N.R.A. has ''for decades been trying to get prior administrations -- Republicans and Democrats -- to take action on the matter but there seems to be no will by the Justice Department to enforce existing gun laws.''
Current and former law enforcement officials have said in interviews that few of these cases are brought because they get far less attention than cases involving white-collar fraud or terrorism.
Law enforcement experts note that more prosecutions for background-check failures probably would not have prevented the Connecticut school massacre, because the gunman in that case used firearms purchased legally by his mother.
Of those denied a gun because of a failed background check in 2010, 47 percent had been previously convicted of a felony or faced a felony charge, and 19 percent were fugitives, according to a recent study financed by the Justice Department.
Another study backed by the Justice Department found that people who are denied the right to buy a firearm are much more likely than the average person to commit a violent crime even after being denied. The study, released in 2008, revealed that people who are denied a gun are 28 percent more likely to be arrested in the five years after they failed their background check compared with the previous five years.
While the federal government has oversight over purchases from registered firearm dealers, it does not require background checks for the millions of firearms sold each year at gun shows and by individuals -- loopholes that gun control advocates hope the administration will work to close.
In 2012, a Pittsburgh man who had been denied a weapon because he had been committed to a psychiatric hospital shot seven people, killing one, with handguns he had purchased from a private seller.
Two years earlier, a man who had been denied a gun opened fire on two police officers at a checkpoint outside the Pentagon with a weapon that had been purchased at a gun show. The officers, who were wounded, returned fire, killing the man.
Under federal law, anyone who tries to purchase a firearm from a licensed dealer must fill out a form about his criminal history. If a person checks yes to any of the questions -- including whether he has been convicted of a felony or is the subject of a restraining order -- the gun dealer cannot legally sell the person a weapon.
But if the person checks no to all the questions, the dealer is required to call a screener who has the name checked against federal databases run by the F.B.I. Typically, the F.B.I. can determine someone's status within minutes, and the dealer can inform the buyer whether he can purchase the firearm.
When people are denied, they are free to leave the store. The local police, however, are not informed that a prohibited buyer has tried to purchase a weapon. The F.B.I. has a process that allows people ''who have been wrongfully denied a firearm transfer'' to appeal through its Web site. According to the Web site, those who are denied are encouraged to provide copies of their fingerprints.
With such a low number of prosecutions, Mr. Arulanandam of the N.R.A. said there is no deterrent for criminals who take their chances by trying to buy a weapon from a gun dealer.
''If the Justice Department started prosecuting these people, it will send a message that if you are disqualified we are sending you to jail,'' he said. ''It's a pretty good message to send to criminals.''

Guns, Maps And Data That Disturb

BYLINE: By DAVID CARR.

Should data have a conscience?
As a journalist, I am trained as an absolutist in matters of open data. Public records should be just that, public, and as agents of transparency, news media outlets should help cast sunlight on those records. In that context, data is not good or bad, right or wrong; it is information that should be there for the asking, taking or publishing.
That was my initial reflex after The Journal News in Westchester County, N.Y., decided, in the aftermath of the Newtown, Conn., shootings, to publish a map with the names and addresses of people who had applied for handgun permits in two suburban counties. I followed a simple logic: the records were open, the public interest was high and journalism that blends both those things makes sense.
But on reflection, was it really journalism? Not so much. The accompanying article was about whether gun permits should be public, but the newspaper seemed to have all but decided that debate by publishing the map. More problematic was the closeness in time to the Newtown massacre, which served to cast suspicion and guilt in tendentious ways. By dropping the records into the maelstrom of a mass shooting, was The Journal News merely putting data-driven link bait out there? 
Publishing is a discrete act, separate from whether something is public or not. Our job as journalists is to draw attention, to point at things, and what we choose to highlight is defined as news. And then it is our job to create context, talk to sources who bring insight and provide analysis. Given that, simply pointing out that something is public as the sole reason for republishing it is not a sufficient justification.
It is one thing to have a public database available that lets me look up whether the neighbor I am feuding with might have a gun permit. It is quite another to publish the names and addresses of all my neighbors who own guns. The decision lacked a rationale. It was what we in the business call ''b matter'' in search of a lead.
''My first reaction was, why are they doing this? What is the purpose?'' asked Leonard Downie Jr., the former executive editor of The Washington Post who now teaches at Arizona State University's Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication. ''You have to have a very high standard when you publish the addresses of people to begin with, even though those are public.''
(The editor of The Journal News declined any further comment, but the paper's publisher and president told my colleague Christine Haughney that she supported the publishing of the data.)
But if a public need is not being met, a public appetite certainly is. Newspapers and various Web sites are full of real estate records, crime reports and marriage applications, all of them public, and all of them published with an understanding that we are nosy looky-loos.
Entire print and Web businesses are built on the publication of mug shots, which may be unseemly, but is perfectly legitimate and, speaking from personal experience, very compelling content.
In fact, in trendy journalistic circles, data is all the rage. The last presidential election seemed to be all about the data, with battles breaking out over polls and projections as much as the policy issues. Much of it is exciting and creates transparency, but data needs to be looked after and shaped in the same way that news articles are.
HomicideWatch.org, an independent database of murders in our nation's capital, has just announced a partnership with The Chicago Sun-Times. This fall, the Knight Foundation, a source of financing for journalistic innovation, put its money behind big data, supporting applications that use data to enhance maps, open up elections and make census results more accessible.
Developers from The Washington Post and The New York Times are working on a crowd-sourced database called Open Elections, intended to create a standardized, linked set of data about elections.
Meanwhile, news organizations are using data to report, to decide which stories to pursue and to discern which areas of coverage are attracting readers. We write stories about Big Brother infiltrating our lives, but sometimes we serve as his wingman.
''Even big, open-sourced data companies like Google make it harder to find your address or your phone number to protect your privacy, to some extent,'' said Nate Silver, who runs the FiveThirtyEight blog at The Times. ''If something is public in theory, like this database was, it will become public in practice eventually. But I still think that you have to think about the implications and social costs of publication.''
Another thing about data is that it doesn't necessarily lie, but it doesn't always tell the truth either. The data on gun permit holders was extracted from various historical records. It was a list of people who had applied for permits at a certain point in time who might or might not have followed up and obtained a gun.
''The United States Census is out of date on April 2, the day after it comes out,'' said Matt Waite, a media professor who specializes in data at the University of Nebraska. ''People die, people are born, people go to prison, but we still treat it as truth when actually it's only as true as humans can make it.''
Like a lot of journalism professionals who make a practice of mining data, Mr. Waite said he was concerned that the criticism against The Journal News -- there have been threats against people who work there -- could actually hurt the cause of free speech, if it prompted officials to close off public records.
It will surprise no one to learn that the response to data disclosure depends a great deal on whose information is being made public. Since its founding more than three years ago, The Texas Tribune, a Web site in Austin, has made a mission of gathering the salary information of every public employee in Texas. That database has been wildly popular.
''From the very first day we started, we have believed in acquiring, cleaning up and presenting public information people need or want to know,'' said Evan Smith, chief executive and editor of the site.
He says he gets livid calls from public employees or their spouses several times a week, but that he always reminds them that the benefits of being a public employee come with the knowledge that their salary is a matter of public record. (Mr. Smith's salary of $315,000 a year is public because ''we believe that sunlight and transparency is a great disinfectant.'')
This week, the site -- which, speaking of disclosure, has a content partnership with The Times -- will use a combination of public statements and its own reporting to publish a data application that will let visitors examine the personal financial interests of the 181 members of the Texas Legislature.
Plenty of people will be peeking in, partly out of prurience, but also because they want to know whose interests are being voted up or down in the coming session.
That exercise sounds very different from plopping a list of possible gun owners on a Web site. We live at a time when data of all kinds can be unleashed with very little friction; part of the value of the news business comes from making sense of it all. When we push the button on something, we expect people to pay attention. We should make sure we are pushing that button for the right reason.

U.S. Debate On Gun Laws Is Put to a Test In Colorado

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY and DAN FROSCH

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 9

LENGTH: 1173 words

DENVER -- With politicians in Washington deeply divided over new gun regulations, an urgent national debate ignited by the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School is storming into state legislatures across the country. And nowhere is that debate more emotionally charged or politically consequential than here in Colorado, a reluctant crucible for the battle over guns.
This state, one of hunters and sport shooters, has endured two of the most horrific mass shootings in American history, and this year for the first time in more than a decade it could pass major gun-control legislation.
Gun-control advocates say it is a moment forged in part by the massacre inside a suburban Denver movie theater in July that left 12 people dead and dozens wounded. But it is also one created by demographics, of population shifts that have nudged the political center left while transforming traditionally rural, conservative swaths of the West. 
''We've had it with mass shootings,'' said Beth McCann, a Democratic state representative. ''People just don't want to hear about another massacre. This is enough.''
To lawmakers and advocates on both sides of the debate, Colorado is becoming a national test case for what kind of gun regulations -- if any -- can gather support from lawmakers, law enforcement officials and a public whose relationship with guns has been forged by tradition as much as tragedy.
This is a place where even the horrors of the 1999 attack at Columbine High School in suburban Denver only temporarily shifted the debate on guns. In 2000, Colorado voters passed new restrictions on purchases made at gun shows, but a few years later, the General Assembly relaxed gun laws by making it easier for people to carry concealed weapons and limited the ability of towns and cities to pass strict gun laws.
Gun ownership here crosses generations and political divisions. Liberal Denver lawyers own handguns, and the Democratic governor takes his son to hunting safety classes. A popular family shooting range sits in the center of Cherry Creek State Park, drawing some sport shooters who voted for President Obama, others who insist he is a communist.
As legislators across the country reconvene, heavily Democratic states like New York, New Jersey and California are considering proposals to restrict assault weapons and ammunition that are far more aggressive than anything likely to pass in Colorado, even with Democrats in control of the Statehouse.
Gov. John W. Hickenlooper, a first-term Democrat, has called for universal background checks of private, individual gun sales, in addition to the checks now required at gun shows and at retail establishments. But in an interview, he said he was unsure about proposals from Democratic lawmakers to ban high-capacity ammunition magazines.
''Even saying that puts some people into a frenzy,'' Mr. Hickenlooper said. ''People in the West have a very strong, deeply anchored belief in people's right to bear arms.''
That division came into sharp relief when Mr. Hickenlooper called for universal background checks in his State of the State address on Thursday. Democrats in one half of the chamber leapt to their feet and applauded while members of the Republican minority sat in stony silence.
Democratic lawmakers have not formally introduced their gun-control measures, but have said they are writing bills that would create background checks for private, person-to-person sales and restrict high-capacity magazines like those used by the gunman in the movie theater, in Aurora.
Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a national gun-control organization, has hired a Denver lobbying firm to support new gun-control laws here.
State Senator Greg Brophy, a Republican, said the attention from outside groups would make Colorado ''ground zero for gun control in the United States.''
Republican supporters of gun rights have bristled at the push for tighter gun laws. One of the first bills introduced in the legislature would allow teachers with concealed-weapons permits to carry guns inside their classrooms (with a school district's permission). Mr. Brophy was one who recoiled at the universal background checks, saying the only way to enforce such a system would be to require all gun owners to register their firearms.
''That is the most onerous regulation ever conceived of in this country outside the outright confiscation of firearms,'' he said. ''Even if I want to loan a shotgun to my nephew to take out pheasant hunting, I can't do that. I don't think they realize here in Colorado just how dangerous that proposal is to liberty.''
The prospect of stricter gun laws has sent gun sales soaring, and unleashed a torrent of new applications for background checks and concealed-carry permits. The Colorado Bureau of Investigation, which runs the checks, has a backlog of nearly 11,000 applications, and wait times have reached unprecedented levels.
Across the country, the battle over guns is pulling states in sharply different directions. While Democratic-controlled states are pushing for greater restrictions on ammunition, assault weapons and tougher background checks, lawmakers in Mississippi are considering changes to the state's concealed weapons bill that are backed by the National Rifle Association.
And Wyoming's Republican-dominated Legislature is considering a bill to block any new federal restrictions on semiautomatic guns or ammunition magazines.
''These weapons they're trying to eliminate are something we hold dear in the Western United States,'' said State Representative Mark Baker of Sweetwater County, in southern Wyoming. ''We're trying to let the federal government know ahead of time we're not going to allow you to enforce your laws and regulations on our state land.''
Colorado still embraces its history of rugged individualism and the range, but it has never been as conservative as some of its neighbors.
''I do think it is important for people to understand that even though we are a Western state and there is a libertarian strain here, I think sometimes people think the gun lobby is maybe more powerful here than it really is,'' said Bill Ritter Jr., a Democratic former governor and a hunter who pointed out that he had been elected despite an F rating from the N.R.A.
And as the gun debate moves ahead, some of the most influential voices may not belong to lobbyists or lawmakers but to relatives who lost their sons and daughters, husbands and wives in the library of Columbine and in Theater 9 in Aurora. For months, several of these families have been huddling with lawmakers and making public appearances to call for tighter background checks and measures to keep guns away from people with mental illnesses.
''It's different now because children are being butchered in schools,'' said Dave Hoover, a police officer in Lakewood, Colo., whose nephew A. J. Boik was one of the 12 people killed in Aurora. ''Because kids were killed at a movie. Because families went to church and were gunned down.''
He added: ''I don't understand why we are even arguing about this.''

Greece Sees Gold Boom, But at a Price

BYLINE: By SUZANNE DALEY; Dimitris Bounias contributed reporting.

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 4

LENGTH: 1439 words

IERISSOS, Greece -- In the forest near here, bulldozers have already begun flattening hundreds of acres for an open pit gold mine and a processing plant, which Canada's Eldorado Gold Corporation hopes to open within two years. Eldorado has reopened other mining operations around here, too, digging for gold, copper, zinc and lead from nearby hills.
For some residents, all this activity, which promises perhaps 1,500 jobs by 2015, is a blessing that could pump some life into the dismal economy of the surrounding villages in this rural northeast region of Greece.
But for hundreds of others, who have mounted repeated protests, the new mining operation is nothing more than a symbol of Greece's willingness these days to accept any development, no matter the environmental cost. Only 10 years ago, they like to point out, Greece's highest court ruled that the amount of environmental damage that mining would do here was not worth the economic gain. 
''This will be a business for 10, maybe 15 years, and then this company will just disappear, leaving all the pollution behind like all the others did,'' said Christos Adamidis, a hotel owner here who fears that the new mining operations will end up destroying other local businesses, including tourism. ''If the price of gold drops, it might not even last that long. And in the meantime, the dust this will create will be killing off the leaves. There will be no goats or olives or bees here.''
Tensions over new development schemes are being felt elsewhere in Greece, too, as the country stumbles into its sixth year of recession, eager to bring in moneymaking operations and forced by its creditors to streamline approval processes. Environmentalists are objecting to plans that would sell off thousands of acres for solar fields and allow oil exploration near delicate ecosystems.
''We see laws changing, policies changing,'' said Theodota Nantsou, the policy coordinator in Athens for the World Wide Fund for Nature. ''We see things getting rolled back under the guise of eliminating impediments to investment. But over the long run, all these things will have a heavy cost.''
The fund says standards are widely being ignored or lowered, affecting air, water and land use, from the reduction of mandatory environmental impact reviews to plans for increasing coal use and the likelihood that 95 percent of Greece's environmental fund -- more than $1 billion collected for projects like improving energy efficiency and sustaining nature conservancies -- will be absorbed into the general government budget.
In June, the fund issued a report saying it was witnessing an ''avalanche of serious environmental losses.'' It said some rollbacks were an attempt to fulfill the demands of the trio of creditors, the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the European Commission, that have been sustaining Greece in recent years. But it said that, to an equal extent, the losses were because of initiatives put forward by various ministries.
No project, however, appears to have elicited more of a public outcry than the resumption of mining operations in the mineral-rich hills here, where legend has it that Alexander the Great also mined for gold. Past mining operations here have been boom-and-bust enterprises, their fortunes swinging with the price of metals, leaving behind ugly piles of sandy gray tailings. Virtually everybody in the area has stories about the runoff from old mining operations, which turned the sea yellow at times.
But perhaps as much as anything, the anger over the mines is a reflection of the fundamental distrust many Greeks feel toward their government: a firm belief that most officials are busy enriching themselves, their friends and their families at the country's expense. Nick Malkoutzis, a columnist for the conservative daily newspaper Kathimerini, wrote that it was hard to blame villagers for their distrust, when so often companies had been allowed to ignore regulations. ''Perhaps in another country, locals would feel more comfortable with the project because the process for awarding public contracts or environmental certificates is transparent and trustworthy,'' he wrote, adding that in Greece, that was not the case.
Opponents complain, for instance, that while making the deal with Eldorado, the government failed to make sure that Greece received a percentage of the earnings, a common practice in mining contracts.
And they believe the 50 million euro letter of credit the government got as a guarantee against any problems is not nearly enough.
A spokesman for Eldorado, Kostas Georgantzis, said the Canadian mining company had actually offered more, but that was all the government wanted.
Until recently, environmentalists were beginning to feel optimistic about Greece. Environmental issues dominated the political agenda after George Papandreou was elected prime minister in 2009. He established an Environment, Energy and Climate Change Ministry and appointed a noted environmentalist to head it. He talked with enthusiasm of eco-tourism and renewable energy.
But as Greece's financial problems snowballed, the head of the ministry was replaced by the former finance minister, George Papaconstantinou, who is now embroiled in a scandal over whether he removed family members from a list of Greeks with Swiss bank accounts. Shortly after his appointment, the permit for Eldorado's mining plans was issued, though it is still under review in the courts.
Officials of Greece's environment ministry, responding in writing to questions, acknowledged that they were overhauling regulations with a view to making ''modern environmental policies'' go hand in hand with much needed investments. But they said the WWF report was ''excessively negative'' in its conclusions.
They also defended the decision to reintroduce mining in the Chalkidiki area, saying that northern Greece constituted a ''wealth reservoir'' of metals worth more than 20 billion euros based on current prices. The officials said the permit was issued after an eight-year period of preparations, evaluations and public consultations that ensured that the mining activity would not damage the environment.
In fact, the officials said, the new activity would ensure that the acidic runoff from abandoned mine operations would be averted and modern practices of waste management implemented.
The ministry officials said they were unable to explain the 50 million euro letter of credit because the official in charge of that was on vacation.
Eldorado has big plans for the region. It intends to invest one billion euros in various mining operations there, and its executives expect mining activities to last 15 years or more.
But some opponents question that too, noting that right now the price of gold hovers around $1,700 an ounce, making even the tailings left behind by past mining efforts valuable. Eldorado is already at work reprocessing those tailings, which still contain about 3.4 grams of gold per ton. But the new open pit mine is expected to produce only 0.81 grams per ton. What will happen if the price of gold drops?
Eldorado officials say the villagers need not worry because the open pit mine will also yield copper. But the villagers are not so sure.
The new mining operations have divided the region, in some cases setting brothers against each other. Most often it is those that live close to the sea, where tourists arrive in the summer, who oppose the project. Those that live in the hills where there is little work generally support it.
''These jobs mean that the barber and the doctor will have work too,'' said Kostas Karagiannis, who has been working clearing the forest. ''It is not just the miners who benefit.''
But opponents worry about dust and ground water pollution. In the last year, opponents of the projects, many of them retirees, have staged more than a half-dozen demonstrations, some of which have been broken up by police shooting tear gas and rubber bullets. Both sides point fingers. Mining officials say the villagers surrounded city hall and kept the mayor imprisoned for eight hours at one point.
But the villagers say that at one particularly large demonstration at the end of October, when 21 villagers were arrested, the police used brutal tactics.
Rania Ververidis, 62, said that she had been ordered out of her car and told to kneel. At that point, she said, a police officer had stomped on her ankle. She was still limping three weeks later, she said.
But she said she intended to protest more. She fears that Greece is in the process ''of selling everything.''
''We can't let that happen without doing anything,'' she said.

Invasion of the Data Snatchers

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; OP-ED COLUMNIST; Pg. 23

LENGTH: 1385 words

YOU are the editor of a local newspaper. A reporter on your staff comes to you having obtained (by legal means) one of the following:
Police records of arrests for drunken driving;
The personal details of all the employees of local clinics that perform abortions;
The subscriber list of a survivalist magazine with pronounced racist overtones;
The names and addresses of food stamp recipients in your community;
The donors to a group that promotes L.G.B.T. rights; 
The names of husbands accused of infidelity in divorce suits, along with the identities of the alleged lovers;
Addresses of homes where pit bulls are kept.
The reporter proposes to publish the names and home addresses and map them on a large graphic, all part of an article on ''The [drunks/abortionists/racists/poor/gays/cheats/scary dogs] next door.''
Some of these lists might strike you as fair game. (Many community newspapers publish D.U.I. arrests, presumably to shame the accused into driving sober.) Others probably make you uncomfortable or indignant. You might find that the tricky part is articulating why: what is the boundary between a public service and an invasion of privacy?
My hypothetical editor's choice is inspired, of course, by an unhypothetical event: the decision by The Journal News in White Plains to map the names and addresses of 33,614 handgun permit holders in two surrounding counties, for a project called ''The gun owner next door.'' I'll return to that decision, but the striking thing was the volume and venom of the reader backlash: thousands of comments -- and not only from gun owners -- overwhelmingly outraged, some of them suggesting that Journal News journalists deserved to have their identities stolen, their homes burgled, their children taunted or, predictably, to be shot.
When it comes to privacy, we are all hypocrites. We howl when a newspaper publishes public records about personal behavior. At the same time, we are acquiescing in a much more sweeping erosion of our privacy -- government surveillance, corporate data-mining, political microtargeting, hacker invasions -- with no comparable outpouring of protest. As a society we have no coherent view of what information is worth defending and how to defend it.
When our privacy is invaded in the name of national security, we -- and our elected representatives, afraid to be thought soft -- generally go along quietly. Our complacency is reinforced by a popular culture that has forsaken Orwell's nightmares for a benign view of authority. In many of my own guilty-pleasure television favorites -- ''The Wire,'' the British thriller series ''MI-5,'' the Danish original of ''The Killing,'' the addictive ''Homeland'' -- surveillance is what the good guys do, and it saves the day.
Meanwhile, as Al Qaeda wanes, our surveillance state continues to grow more intrusive, with woefully little oversight or accountability.
Last month Julia Angwin of The Wall Street Journal disclosed that Attorney General Eric Holder had authorized the National Counterterrorism Center to copy and examine pretty much any information the government has collected about you. In the past, the agency couldn't store information about ordinary Americans unless they were suspects in or party to a specific investigation. Under the new orders, flight records, lists of Americans hosting foreign-exchange students, financial records of people seeking federally backed mortgages, health records of patients at veterans' hospitals -- pick a database, and this obscure agency has permission to study it for patterns that ostensibly predict terrorist behavior, and to share it with foreign governments, whether or not you are suspected of any wrongdoing. The new rules were subjected to robust official debate -- all behind closed doors.
Likewise, while we were all distracted by the dance on the fiscal cliff, the 112th Congress in its final days whisked through a renewal of the law that governs eavesdropping by American intelligence agencies on Americans' phone calls and e-mail traffic. A couple of senators made modest attempts to hold the eavesdroppers more accountable by, for example, disclosing the number of law-abiding citizens whose communications have been intercepted. Their efforts were voted down.
''The Obama administration's position on privacy is basically 'Trust us, we're good guys,' '' said Daniel Solove of George Washington University, whose book ''Nothing to Hide'' challenges the myth that law-abiding citizens have nothing to fear from government snooping. ''That's exactly what Bush said. And it's also the same thing that any despot says. We shouldn't have to trust.''
Rigorous, independent oversight, he added, not only protects against abuses but also helps assure that what we do in the name of security actually works. But it doesn't happen if we don't demand it.
The government, of course, is not the only -- not even the most aggressive -- invader. You can take your pick of the ways Facebook and Google are monetizing you by serving up your personal profile and browsing habits to advertisers for profit. Some of this feels harmless, or even useful -- why shouldn't my mobile device serve me ads tailored to my interests? But some of it is flat-out creepy. One of the more obnoxious trends is the custom-targeting of that irresistibly vulnerable market, our children.
When our personal information is exploited this way, we may grumble, or we may seek the largely false comfort of tweaking our privacy settings, but we feel helpless before the mystifying rush of technology.
You would think the one sort of invasion just about everyone deplores was hacking. But even there we are ambivalent. When Rupert Murdoch's tabloids were caught pillaging the voice mail of celebrities, the public response was muted; when it turned out that they had hacked the phone of a 13-year-old murder victim, the pitchforks and torches came out.
Or take the Steubenville case. In Steubenville, Ohio, authorities charged two members of the high school football team with the repeated rape of a passed-out-drunk 16-year-old, but did not charge the many others who allegedly cheered them on and made videos. So the online activists of Anonymous took it upon themselves to hack into private accounts, recover deleted and incriminating videos, and make them public. Amanda Marcotte wrestled with the moral dilemma on Slate: ''By stepping in and holding people accountable, Anonymous stands a very good chance of taking action that actually does something to stop rape. But: This type of online vigilante justice is potentially invading the privacy of or defaming innocent Steubenville residents, and even if everything published is true, there are very serious legal limits to the Anonymous strategy.''
As a journalist, I'm more often on the side of the invaders than the invaded. I cherish the freedom to publish. But the freedom to publish includes the freedom not to publish when the cost outweighs the benefit.
Which brings me back to The Journal News and its gun project. I sympathize with the paper's effort to dramatize the commonplace reality of gun ownership at a time when the subject is so sadly on our minds. I don't buy the gun owners' assertion that the disclosure is an invitation to burglars in search of firearms; on the contrary, the publicity sends criminals the same message as those front-door notices of your home alarm system: Try next door. It's also conceivable that the attention will prompt some owners to lock up unsecured weapons.
But when you are going to make a sizable population of law-abiding citizens feel violated, you have to ask yourself, what is the offsetting gain? In this case, I think, not much. The information The Journal News provided its readers is so far from complete as to be misleading. The public records identify only legal handguns. They tell you nothing about the neighbor who has an equally legal and equally lethal rifle or shotgun, let alone an illegal weapon. The publication has not spurred a healthy debate; it has merely escalated a shouting match, and given the N.R.A. a new rallying cry. The outcry may even provoke state legislatures to withdraw gun databases from public records, so they will not be available when they might really be useful. It's a close call, but I'd have found a different way to make the point.

Newtown Debates Building's Fate After Shooting

BYLINE: By RAY RIVERA

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 17

LENGTH: 760 words

NEWTOWN, Conn. -- Many people here still remember the huge green footprints that once led up to the front entrance of Sandy Hook Elementary School. Children were told that they had been left by the Jolly Green Giant.
That was one of the many fond memories of the school, memories that connect families and generations. Now, as this community of 27,000 struggles to recover from a mass shooting that killed 20 first graders and six staff members at the school, public officials and residents have begun preparing for the painful decision over what to do with the building.
Residents packed into the auditorium of Newtown High School on Sunday afternoon for the first of what might be several meetings to discuss the school's future. Opinions varied sharply about whether to reopen the school, renovate it, turn it into a shrine or a park, or raze it. 
Stephanie Carson, who has a son who was at the school on Dec. 14, the day of the shooting, said it should be knocked down.
''I cannot ask my son or any of the people at the school to ever walk back into that building, and he has asked to never go back,'' she said. ''I know that there are children who were there who have said they would like to go back to Sandy Hook. However, the reality is we have to be so careful. Even walking down the halls, the children become so scared at any unusual sound. I don't see how it would be possible.''
A month after the shooting, Sandy Hook Elementary remains a crime scene. Few have been allowed past the police cars and barricades still guarding the roadway and into the building where Adam Lanza, for reasons still unknown, went on a horrifying killing spree before fatally shooting himself.
Earlier this month, the school's 400 students began attending a school that had been shuttered in nearby Monroe, Conn. That building was reopened after the hallways and classrooms were remade to resemble the ones they had left behind.
Audra Barth, the mother of a third grader and a first grader at Sandy Hook, was among the parents who said closing the school would further rob children who had already lost so much.
''My children have had everything taken away from them,'' she said. Referring to the numerous gifts, including candy, that had been donated since the shooting, she added, ''Chocolate is great, but they need their school.''
If there was a unifying theme among parents and others in Sunday's comments, it was that the children should be kept together, at least for the next several years, and not split apart into separate schools. The concerns, raised by many of the parents who spoke, stemmed from discussions last year -- before the shooting -- in which school officials proposed closing down an elementary school and shuffling the district. E. Patricia Llodra, Newtown's first selectwoman, said that proposal was no longer being considered.
Discussions over the school building's fate seemed to be the latest step in the community's slow path to recovery, coming after the Public Works Department began picking up the bounty of flowers, teddy bears, paper angels and other tributes that had accumulated on the roadsides around the school.
More meetings will come when the town begins looking at how to honor the victims with a permanent memorial.
Ideas on Sunday included turning the school into a planetarium where children could gaze at the stars and converting it into a center for peace education.
Newtown is the latest in a growing list of communities that have been thrust into making such a choice.
After two students killed 12 other students and a teacher at Columbine High School in Colorado in April 1999, that community ultimately decided to keep that school open. Some $2.6 million, much of it donated, was spent on renovations that included turning the library, where the gunmen ended their rampage, into a glass atrium with a canopy of evergreens and aspens painted on the ceilings.
At Virginia Tech, where 32 people were gunned down by a student in April 2007, the building where 30 of the killings occurred was turned into the Center for Peace Studies and Violence Prevention.
Mergim Bajraliu, 17, a senior at Newtown High School who attended Sandy Hook Elementary and whose sister, a fourth grader, was there the day of the shooting, urged the town to follow the examples of Columbine and Virginia Tech.
''Despite everything that happened to my sister, both her and I have amazing memories of that school,'' he said on Sunday, recalling sack races and visits to the nearby firehouse. ''I think children in the future deserve the same youthful memories I have.''

Upstate Gun Owners Cast A Cold Eye on Cuomo Effort

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

TONAWANDA, N.Y. -- Harold W. Schroeder's first gun was his late father's prized Winchester 12-gauge shotgun, bequeathed to him when he turned 16. In college, Mr. Schroeder and his classmates kept guns in their fraternity house so they could hunt pheasant.
On Friday night, Mr. Schroeder, now 77, gathered with friends at the Mohawk Rifle and Pistol Club, slipping .22-caliber rounds, one after another, into the magazine for his Smith & Wesson Model 41 pistol. He fixed his eyes on a quarter-sized bull's-eye hanging 50 feet away and pulled the trigger.
Mr. Schroeder, known to all as Budd, is an accomplished shooter; for decades he has been a regular at pistol competitions in western New York. And for just as long, he has devoted himself to protecting gun rights in New York State, joining a grass-roots organization in 1966 to fight measures proposed in the wake of President John F. Kennedy's assassination, and fighting gun control laws ever since. 
Now, in the aftermath of last month's massacre of first graders in Newtown, Conn., Mr. Schroeder is pleading with lawmakers, in what he acknowledges is an uphill battle, to block what his group has deemed the biggest threat to New York gun owners since the 1960s. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, propelled into action by recent mass shootings, has proposed what he says would be the nation's toughest package of gun laws, including an expanded ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. The Legislature appears prepared to go along, perhaps as soon as this week. Aides to Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, and state lawmakers continued to negotiate on Sunday.
Mr. Schroeder's efforts are emblematic of those by gun rights advocates around the country, who are desperately trying to head off what they view as ill-advised restrictions that they do not believe would solve the problem of gun violence. Mr. Schroeder, a retired park superintendent who teaches gun-safety instruction and is a former board member of the National Rifle Association, said that gun owners felt demonized in the wake of the shooting and that they looked upon what happened in Newtown in the same way as those who had never fired a gun.
''I'm every bit as angry as they are,'' he said. ''It's an atrocity that these things happen -- I mean, a real atrocity. But somewhere along the way the system broke down. Now, this kid obviously had mental problems, but it wasn't brought to the attention of people who could help him or put him away.''
Mr. Schroeder is more than 250 miles and a world away from the State Capitol, but he has been meeting with lawmakers from western New York, many of whom he has known for years, in an effort to persuade them to stand firm against Mr. Cuomo's proposals. He writes a weekly political column for two local newspapers that emphasizes the Second Amendment.
He is chairman of the board of directors of the Shooters Committee on Political Education, or SCOPE, which has about 3,000 members and 200 affiliated gun clubs across the state. The group is one element of the loose coalition of groups and individuals that make up the gun lobby in Albany -- there are also the professional lobbyists who represent gun manufacturers; the N.R.A. and its state affiliate, the New York State Rifle and Pistol Association; and bloggers, talk show hosts and local groups all trying to influence the debate. And there are sympathetic lawmakers, many of them from rural parts of the state.
''Downstate, we're a bunch of criminals,'' Mr. Schroeder said. ''Upstate, it's a different story.''
Mr. Schroeder traces the movement back to the fight over the federal Gun Control Act of 1968, enacted after the assassinations of Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.
''Ever since that bill passed, which was supposed to be the be-and-end-all of gun control, that was just the tip of the iceberg,'' Mr. Schroeder said. ''And from there on we've been doing the fight ever since.''
Every legislative session brings a new fight: he has battled year after year with the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, whose chamber has passed numerous new gun controls, and clashed bitterly with Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican, who won a package of gun laws in 2000 (and, Mr. Schroeder said, ''sold out the gun owners for a 15-minute press conference.'')
''I don't think we've ever had a pro-gun governor in our lifetimes,'' he said. Mr. Schroeder used his first Winchester shotgun for bird hunting. An uncle gave him a .22-caliber rifle, perfect for shooting rats at a nearby railroad dump. In college, he joined the Army Reserve as a bandsman, playing the alto saxophone, and was later called into active duty and sent to Fort Bragg, N.C., where he made the pistol team. (''It saved me from digging foxholes,'' he said.) Some of Mr. Schroeder's concerns are practical: he says New York already has enough restrictions on guns, and pulls out a plastic binder containing Article 265 of the State Penal Law, on firearms and dangerous weapons, to demonstrate how voluminous the existing laws already are. Some concerns are more philosophical: he argues that an expanded ban on assault weapons is simply a wrongheaded approach to reducing violence.
He said Mr. Cuomo and others were using the Newtown violence to push measures that would take them toward a goal they held long before any recent mass shootings -- banning guns altogether. He also said upstanding, taxpaying, legal gun owners were being punished for the actions of a few madmen. ''It's like saying you shouldn't have any politicians because we got a couple of crooks we caught,'' he said.
He also argued on constitutional grounds, recalling the American colonists who resisted the British at the Battles of Lexington and Concord. He says of the Second Amendment, ''The sole purpose of that was to prevent a dystopic government from taking over the population.'' He added, ''Sometimes you get accused of being paranoid, but if you watch history, no republic or democracy has ever gone to a totalitarian form of government without first disarming the populace.''
Mr. Schroeder's fellow gun enthusiasts at the pistol club, located near Buffalo, shared his outrage over the proposals, but were pessimistic about stopping them.
They said politicians needed to focus on keeping guns out of the hands of the mentally ill; making sure that people who have illegal guns and use them to commit crimes are properly punished; and improving security in schools. They said Mr. Cuomo's proposal to ban more guns would not address the problem.
''It would outlaw most of the guns we shoot,'' said Frank Bialy, a retired chemist who used to coach a high school rifle team. ''What's so frustrating is the people who are here obeying the law are the ones who pay all the prices when these crazy things happen.''

Real-World Killings Pressure TV Fiction

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER

SECTION: Section C; Column 0; The Arts/Cultural Desk; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 1183 words

LOS ANGELES -- When Kevin Reilly, the chairman for entertainment at the Fox network, commissioned an ambitious thriller series called ''The Following,'' about a Hannibal Lecter-like serial killer who inspires a legion of deranged followers, his intention was to challenge the cable business, not the culture.
Now, in the wake of the horrific shooting of schoolchildren in Newtown, Conn., Mr. Reilly knows he cannot avoid questions about the propriety of putting that kind of content on television in an atmosphere of heightened sensitivity about violence.
''The timing is not great,'' Mr. Reilly said in an interview here during the semiannual press tour where networks discuss new programs. ''The show does not deserve to be the poster child for our society.'' 
But if the persistent questioning of Mr. Reilly and other executives by reporters who cover the television business is any indication, the issue of extreme violence on screen and its potential impact has become a thicket programmers cannot avoid.
''I don't think there's anyone on this planet whose life hasn't been changed and/or affected by the recent course of events,'' said Nina Tassler, the president of CBS Entertainment. But, she argued, ''nothing that is on the air is inappropriate.''
CBS has more programming involving murders than any other network, but, Ms. Tassler said, the network justifies the level of carnage by assuring that ''the bad guys are brought to justice.'' In response to criticism of a specific CBS show, ''Criminal Minds,'' which features a serial killer every week, she said she would not allow her 14-year-old child to watch that show because ''it's an adult show.''
Bob Greenblatt, the chairman of NBC Entertainment (which has a show about a young Hannibal Lecter coming up), said, ''There are a lot of parameters in broadcast television that we think about, not only as a company that has responsibilities to the F.C.C., but as people who have families.''
Debates about television violence have waxed and waned for more than 50 years, sometimes surrounding shows, like ''The Rifleman'' and ''Kojak,'' that now seem tame. The increasing appeal of cable series, however, has changed the stakes. In 2001 Bob Wright, chairman of NBC at the time, wrote a memo pointing out an especially violent episode of ''The Sopranos'' on HBO and questioning whether ''there was a lesson'' for network shows in the popularity and acceptance of that level of violence.
Cable series have become more violent and more popular in the years since. The six highest-rated dramas on cable in the past year were ''The Walking Dead,'' ''Hatfields & McCoys,'' ''True Blood,'' ''Sons of Anarchy,'' ''American Horror Story,'' and ''Game of Thrones.'' All contain high levels of violence.
In an interview Mr. Reilly cited those shows and others, saying: ''You look at the top scripted shows on cable, and they are all pretty heavy duty. These are not some small cultural little things that people like. The top drama on television now is a show where people get their heads blown off at point-blank range.''
The show Mr. Reilly referred to, AMC's ''The Walking Dead,'' is not the most-watched drama on television, but it does rank first among viewers between the ages of 18 and 49 -- the audience that executives want to reach most because advertisers pay the most for them. (Over all the most popular drama is CBS's ''NCIS,'' which, like virtually every CBS drama, features at least one murder every week.)
On ''The Walking Dead'' a group of survivors from a dystopian upheaval are compelled to kill hosts of zombies in every episode. Sometimes those zombies are children.
Mr. Reilly said the challenge for a network programmer is to compete with that kind of show on cable, which has never been held to the same strictures over content, while trying to maintain sensitivity to cultural standards, something still expected more of companies with broadcast licenses. The outcry over the shootings in Connecticut and elsewhere is clearly complicating that effort.
''Had the incident in Connecticut not occurred, I think everybody would be saying 'The Following' is a great show, and you're taking on cable at their own game,'' Mr. Reilly said. He noted that AMC's ''Breaking Bad'' is now among the most praised shows on television, but it is unquestionably dark and violent.
''If you are going to be in this genre,'' he said, ''the bar is set at the level of shows like 'Breaking Bad.' You can't come in lower and succeed.''
The violence in ''The Following'' is occasionally graphic and disturbing: A woman stabs herself in the eye; a man goes through a street setting strangers on fire. Kevin Williamson, the show's creator, said in one of the press sessions that he was disturbed by the Newtown incident and the earlier mass shooting at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo.
''We sit in the writers' room after that happened, and we just, sort of, we're all traumatized by it,'' Mr. Williamson said. ''It reaches a moment where that just gets too real, and it's very disturbing.'' But he added: ''I'm writing fiction. I'm just a storyteller.''
John Landgraf, the president of FX, which programs hit dramas based on some level of violence like ''America Horror Story'' and ''Justified,'' stressed a distinction between what he called ''third-person entertainment'' and ''first-person entertainment.'' The former describes the passive viewing of scripted dramas; the latter describes participatory entertainment, like video games, where shooting and mayhem are personally inflicted on characters.
He explicitly tied the prevalence of violence in the United States to the availability of guns, noting that television viewers in Britain watch the same shows as Americans and play the same video games, but that the country has drastically lower murder rates.
''We should be looking at ourselves, but I think we have to look at what is most substantially responsible for this kind of violence,'' Mr. Landgraf said. ''One way to look at that is by looking at the rate at which it takes place in our country and other countries that don't have access to those kinds of 100-round, 30-round assault-weapon guns.''
He did not apologize, however, for the emphasis on life-or-death drama in FX's shows.
''We're mammals,'' he said. ''Our greatest fear is death, and if you want to rivet people, you're going to tend to hover around questions of life and death because that's the thing that rivets our attention most naturally.''
The Fox network has no intention of backing away from ''The Following,'' which stands as its most important show of a dismal season. Mr. Reilly plans to build his prime-time schedule partly around the show, perhaps using it exactly as AMC has been using ''The Walking Dead,'' in a pair of eight-episode bursts twice a season.
''Most viewers compartmentalize,'' Mr. Reilly said. ''It's apples and oranges in their lives. It's entertainment vs. real life, fact and fiction. If you're not crazy, you have a very easy time to separate the two, if you're not a delusional human being -- which is, thankfully, the vast majority of people in the world.''

LENGTH: 766 words

8 P.M. (TCM) AFI'S MASTER CLASS: THE ART OF COLLABORATION In this latest installment the series focuses on the artistic relationship between the director Robert Zemeckis and the cinematographer Don Burgess, who together have made ''Forrest Gump'' (1994), ''Contact'' (1997), ''Cast Away'' (2000) and ''Flight'' (2012). The interview is followed at 9 by ''What Lies Beneath,'' their 2000 thriller about a doctor (Harrison Ford) who, unknown to his beautiful wife (Michelle Pfeiffer, above with Mr. Ford), has betrayed her by having an affair. But when she starts seeing the face of a young woman (Amber Valletta) in their home, he dismisses her terror as delusion -- until it becomes clear that the apparition is out for revenge. The men also discuss some movies that have inspired them, including Mike Nichols's ''Carnal Knowledge'' (1971), about two college friends (Jack Nicholson and Arthur Garfunkel) coping with the sexual revolution, to be shown at 12:45 a.m. 
3 P.M. (Fox Movie) GHOST TOWN (2008) Ricky Gervais stars as Bertram Pincus, a misanthropic Manhattan dentist who sees spirits after having a near-death experience during a routine colonoscopy. Greg Kinnear (above left, with Mr. Gervais) plays Frank Herlihy, a two-timing yuppie who was hit by a bus while trying to avoid a falling air conditioner. And Tיa Leoni is Frank's widow, Gwen, whom he wants Bertram to befriend and prevent from remarrying. She hates Bertram at first, and then she doesn't. ''It would be easy to make too much of this froth, directed by David Koepp (screenwriter of Spielberg blockbusters) from a script he wrote with John Kamps,'' Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times. ''A latter-day hybrid of 'Topper' and 'Blithe Spirit' and a visual ode to autumn in New York, 'Ghost Town' is a screwball comedy with no big surprises or hidden metaphors.'' But instead of getting ''mired in sentimentality like flies in molasses,'' the film ''tiptoes to the edge of that sticky mess, but it doesn't get caught there.''
8 P.M. (Fox) BONES In this two-hour episode Brennan (Emily Deschanel) and Booth (David Boreanaz) go undercover to investigate the case of a professional ballroom dancer who was found dead shortly before her audition for a popular competition show. Then the Jeffersonian team delves into the murder of a controversial archaeologist who had just made the discovery of his career.
8 P.M. (Discovery) EXTREME SMUGGLING Filmed in part from the perspective of the smugglers, this new series examines the ways criminals try to feed the demand within the United States for guns, exotic animals and, in this premiere episode, drugs. ''Shipwreck Men,'' at 9, follows salvage companies who patrol the coast of southern Florida for boats in distress.
8 P.M. (CBS) HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER Robin (Cobie Smulders) insists that Barney (Neil Patrick Harris) ask her father for permission to marry her before she announces their engagement. In ''2 Broke Girls,'' at 9, three's a crowd when Max (Kat Dennings), Caroline (Beth Behrs) and Andy (Ryan Hansen) spend a weekend in a luxurious cabin in the woods. And in ''Mike & Molly,'' at 9:30, Molly (Melissa McCarthy) encourages Mike (Bill Gardell) to join her in giving up caffeine and eating healthier to improve her chances of getting pregnant -- causing them both to go through withdrawal.
8 P.M. (Syfy) CONTINUUM Rachel Nichols plays Kiera Cameron, a City Protective Services officer from 2077 who is swept into the past when terrorists escape execution by time-traveling to 2012 in this new series. Erik Knudsen is Alec Sadler, the teenage technology wizard who helps Kiera infiltrate a police department where, with the help of her new partner, Detective Carlos Fonnegra (Victor Webster), she tries to foil the terrorists' plot before they change the course of history and prevent her from returning to her husband and son. The season premiere of ''Being Human,'' at 9, picks up 15 months after Aidan (Sam Witwer) was buried alive as punishment from the vampire leader, the ghost Sally (Meaghan Rath) was lost in a state of limbo and the plan of Josh (Sam Huntington) to kill his werewolf maker endangered his girlfriend, Nora (Kristen Hager), instead. And in a new season of ''Lost Girl,'' at 10, a Fae sideshow comes to town to take advantage of the chaos resulting from the bombing of the Light Fae headquarters and the declining condition of the Ash.
10 P.M. (NBC) DECEPTION Detective Joanna Padget Locasto (Meagan Good) continues to search within the wealthy Bowers family for the answers behind the drug overdose of her estranged best friend. KATHRYN SHATTUCK

To Get Movies Into China, Hollywood Gives Censors a Preview

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CIEPLY and BROOKS BARNES

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 1908 words

LOS ANGELES -- When ''Kung Fu Panda 3'' kicks its way into China's theaters in 2016, the country's vigilant film censors will find no nasty surprises.
After all, they have already dropped in to monitor the movie at the DreamWorks Animation campus here. And the story line, production art and other creative elements have met their approval.
The lure of access to China's fast-growing film market -- now the world's second largest, behind that of the United States -- is entangling studios and moviemakers with the state censors of a country in which American notions of free expression simply do not apply.
Whether studios are seeking to distribute a completed film in China or join with a Chinese company for a co-production shot partly in that country, they have discovered that navigating the murky, often shifting terrain of censorship is part of the process. 
Billions of dollars ride on whether they get it right. International box-office revenue is the driving force behind many of Hollywood's biggest films, and often plays a deciding role in whether a movie is made. Studios rely on consultants and past experience -- and increasingly on informal advance nods from foreign officials -- to help gauge whether a film will pass censorship; if there are problems they can sometimes be addressed through appeal and subsequent negotiations.
But Paramount Pictures just learned the hard way that some things won't pass muster -- like American fighter pilots in dogfights with MIGs. The studio months ago submitted a new 3-D version of ''Top Gun'' to Chinese censors. The ensuing silence was finally recognized as rejection.
Problems more often affect films that touch the Chinese directly. ''Any movie about China made by outsiders is going to be very sensitive,'' said Rob Cohen, who directed ''The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor,'' among the first in a wave of co-productions between American studios -- in this case, Universal Pictures -- and Chinese companies.
One production currently facing scrutiny is Disney and Marvel's ''Iron Man 3,'' parts of which were filmed in Beijing in the last month. It proceeded under the watchful eye of Chinese bureaucrats, who were invited to the set and asked to advise on creative decisions, according to people briefed on the production who asked for anonymity to avoid conflict with government or company officials. Marvel and Disney had no comment.
Another prominent film, Ang Lee's ''Life of Pi,'' which was nominated last week for 11 Academy Awards, made it through the process mostly unscathed, but got some pushback over a line in which a character declared that ''religion is darkness.''
''They modified the translation a little, for fear of provoking religious people,'' Mr. Lee said.
Hollywood as a whole is shifting toward China-friendly fantasies that will fit comfortably within a revised quota system, which allows more international films to be distributed in China, where 3-D and large-format Imax pictures are particularly favored.
At the same time, it is avoiding subject matter and situations that are likely to cause conflict with the roughly three dozen members of a censorship board run by China's powerful State Administration of Radio, Film and Television, or S.A.R.F.T.
In addition, some studios are quietly asking Chinese officials for assurance that planned films, even when they do not have a Chinese theme, will have no major censorship problems.
The censorship bureau did not respond to a list of questions submitted by The New York Times seeking information about its process and guidelines.
Studios are quickly discovering that a key to access in China is the inclusion of Chinese actors, story lines and locations. But the more closely a film examines China, the more likely it is to collide with shifting standards, unwritten rules and unfamiliar political powers who hold sway over what can be seen on the country's roughly 12,000 movie screens.
Mr. Cohen's ''Mummy'' film, which was shot throughout China in 2007, was a historical fantasy about an evil emperor who is magically resurrected by foreign adventurers in 1946. The script was preapproved by China's censorship board with only token changes -- the emperor's name had to be fictionalized, for instance. The censors also cautioned that the ancient ruler should not resemble Mao Zedong.
On reviewing the finished film, however, they found a deeper problem that ''we didn't have any way of seeing, or any way of fixing,'' Mr. Cohen said: ''White Westerners were saving China.'' The picture was approved, he said, but its release was delayed until it had played elsewhere in the world, and pirated versions took a bite out of the Chinese box-office receipts.
For Americans, dealings with the Chinese censors are mostly a distant and secondhand business. Films are normally submitted by their Chinese partners, while various consultants in China handle the bureaucratic communications that lead to approval or rejection.
But those who shoot in China often assume that censorship officials have eyes and ears on the set. ''There were points where we were shooting with a crew of 500 people,'' said Mr. Cohen of his movie. ''I'm not sure who was who or what, but knowing the way the system works, it's completely clear that had we deviated from the script, it would not have gone unnoticed.''
In a 2011 Web post, Robert Cain, a producer and consultant who guides filmmakers through China's system, described having worked in Shanghai on a romantic comedy that went off script; the director included a take in which an extra, holding a camcorder, pretended to be a theater patron taping a movie on a screen.
The next day, Mr. Cain and others involved with the film were summoned to the office of a Communist Party member who told them the film was being shut down for its ''naןve'' and ''untruthful'' portrayal of film piracy. Assuming they had been reported by a spy on their crew, the producers apologized and managed to keep the film on track.
Studios are seeking out official co-productions, in which a Chinese company works with an American studio in financing and creating a film, because they can bypass the Chinese quota system and bring their distributors a 43 percent share of ticket sales, rather than the 25 percent allotted to foreign-made films.
Co-productions like ''Kung Fu Panda 3'' draw close monitoring by the censors at every step. Scripts are submitted in advance. Representatives of S.A.R.F.T., according to Mr. Cohen and others, may be present on the set to guard against any deviation. And there is an unofficial expectation that the government's approved version of the film will be seen both in China and elsewhere, though in practice it is not unusual for co-productions to slip through the system with differing versions, one for China, one for elsewhere in the world.
Questions about how Chinese forces are shaping American movies are now playing out in the making of ''Iron Man 3,'' which is set for release on May 3.
Disney and its Marvel unit want ''Iron Man 3'' to gain co-production status, partly because the previous two ''Iron Man'' movies performed well in China. To work toward that distinction, Disney and Marvel made a deal last year for Beijing-based DMG Entertainment to join in producing and financing the film.
But they have taken a middle-of-the-road approach that appears intended to limit Chinese meddling in the creative process. A finished script was not submitted for approval and the companies have not yet made an application for official designation as a co-production. Rather, they are trying to show a heightened sense of cooperation in hopes the government will approve the status once that application is formally made in the spring.
The producers made a presentation to censors early in the process, describing broad strokes of the story, the history of other Marvel and Disney movies, and plans to integrate Chinese characters into the movie.
That won a conceptual sign-off for the film, which is being directed by Shane Black. Next, bureaucrats were invited to the set and were able to meet the star, Robert Downey Jr.
Hollywood executives are only now becoming familiar with the censorship board and its workings. A recent count by one of their advisers found that the board has 37 members, including representatives from government agencies and interest groups, like the Communist Youth League and the Women's Federation, along with filmmakers, academics and professional bureaucrats.
At the top of S.A.R.F.T. is Cai Fuchao, a recent member of the Communist Party Central Committee. In a previous municipal post in Beijing, he was widely reported to have policed Web sites for banned material with the help of 10,000 volunteers, and to have joined in a roundup of a million illegally published books in 2004.
In 2008, after an uproar over the release of Ang Lee's ''Lust, Caution,'' whose story of wartime love and collaboration caused unease even after sex scenes were deleted, written censorship guidelines were circulated in China, in what filmmakers there took to be a crackdown.
Some of the prohibitions were broad, barring violations of the fundamental principles of the Constitution and the harming of social morality. Others were more pointed. Disparagement of the People's Liberation Army and the police were banned, as were ''murder, violence, horrors, ghosts, demons and supernaturalism.''
In all, the standards would appear to clash with almost any American film, other than, perhaps, the PG-rated animated fare of a DreamWorks Animation. (Even ''Kung Fu Panda'' provoked objections by some Chinese, who saw the lead character as profaning a nationally revered animal.)
But some who have dealt with S.A.R.F.T. say the censors are often pragmatic, and appear to walk a line between the demands of viewers, who want more global fare, and those of politicians, who are out to protect the status quo.
For example, 20th Century Fox managed to get ''Life of Pi'' through with only the modification of the ''religion is darkness'' line, despite the movie's spiritual themes -- which tread close to a prohibition against the preaching of cult beliefs and superstitions -- and the earlier trouble over ''Lust, Caution.''
For Americans, the hard part is knowing what might suddenly cause trouble -- initial approvals notwithstanding. In 2009, Sony Pictures and its partner, the China Film Group, submitted their script for ''The Karate Kid'' to China's censors, and dutifully changed parts of the story to suit them. But the finished film was rejected, according to people who were briefed on the process, essentially because film bureaucrats were unhappy that its villain was Chinese.
After negotiation, 12 minutes of the film were cut, and it was released in China, though later than intended.
Some filmmakers here suggest that impositions by the China censors are similar to the restrictions imposed by a ratings system administered by the Motion Picture Association of America. But Joan Graves, the chairwoman of Hollywood's ratings board, insists otherwise. ''We're the only major country with a ratings system that does it on a voluntary basis,'' she said.
Steven Soderbergh, whose film ''Contagion'' was shot partly in Hong Kong, said the participation of China's censors simply added to the chorus of input that surrounds every big-budget filmmaker.
''I'm not morally offended or outraged,'' Mr. Soderbergh said. ''It's fascinating to listen to people's interpretations of your story.''

Doctor Returns to Congo And Is Hailed as a Hero

BYLINE: By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 8

LENGTH: 766 words

BUKAVU, Democratic Republic of Congo -- It was as if someone extraordinarily famous had come to town. Thousands of people craned their necks as the motorcade roared by, cellphones out to grab a snap, an air of expectation and excitement eclipsing all the street noise of clanging Coke bottles and beeping motorcycles.
''There he is!'' someone yelled. ''Le docteur!'' 
In the back of a white truck -- zooming past so fast it spewed clouds of dust -- sat a kind-faced man staring out at the crowds: Denis Mukwege, a gynecological surgeon renowned for repairing the insides of thousands of brutally raped women. He returned home triumphantly on Monday after more than two months in exile after nearly being assassinated, possibly for speaking out on behalf of the countless women who have been gang-raped by armed groups that stalk the hills of eastern Congo.
Congo, torn by war for years and traumatized by dictators for decades, is desperate for heroes. So perhaps it is no surprise that Dr. Mukwege carries such an enormous amount of pride -- and hope -- on his rounded shoulders, which are most often covered by a white lab coat. For around 15 years now, he has kept a major hospital running in one of the most turbulent parts of the country, sometimes performing as many as 10 operations a day, on women who have been raped so viciously that they stumble in with death trudging just a few steps behind.
Susannah Sirkin, deputy director of Physicians for Human Rights, which provides help to Dr. Mukwege's Panzi Hospital, said it ''stands out as a center of excellence for others to emulate and replicate across his country and beyond.''
For his work, Dr. Mukwege has won many human rights awards and is often mentioned as a contender for the Nobel Peace Prize. The American playwright Eve Ensler, who works closely with Dr. Mukwege, called him a ''spiritual force.''
Banners with messages like ''We are behind you'' flew all across Bukavu on Monday. One man wore a shirt that said, ''Welcome our Superman.''
The obvious love and support for Dr. Mukwege among the people here make it all the more difficult to discern who was behind the assassination attempt on a night last October, when four armed men slipped into his house in Bukavu and waylaid him as he drove in. When his trusted guard jumped out to confront the attackers, the gunmen shot him in the head. With bullets flying, Dr. Mukwege, 57, threw himself to the ground, and the attackers fled. Less than a week later, he escaped to Belgium with his wife and two daughters.
The local authorities say they do not know who tried to kill him. But many of his supporters have their suspicions. A month earlier, Dr. Mukwege had delivered a powerful speech at the United Nations in which he denounced mass rape in Congo and railed against his own government -- which has a record of silencing critics -- for allowing it to occur with impunity, to the point that the United Nations has called Congo ''the rape capital of the world.''
He has also criticized Rwanda for fomenting chaos in Congo. Bukavu, though, is relatively safe. A sprawling, disheveled city hunched over Lake Kivu, one of the most beautiful bodies of water in Africa, it has a thin blue haze from thousands of cooking fires. But around the city, in just about every direction, lurk men with guns.
As Dr. Mukwege's truck pulled into Panzi Hospital on Monday, a crowd of women -- many of them rape victims -- burst into song. People yelled ''Hallelujah!'' One delegation of women from an island in Lake Kivu presented Dr. Mukwege with all he needed to survive for a few days -- a bucket of charcoal, several cabbages, pineapples, onions and a gigantic pumpkin.
''We don't need the military or Monusco,'' said one woman, referring to the United Nations mission in Congo. ''We women will protect you.''
Some people who had stood for hours under the sun were now huddled in the rain, waiting to hear him speak.
Overwhelmed by the outpouring of emotion, Dr. Mukwege mopped his face with his sleeve and stepped to the podium.
''The power of darkness will be defeated,'' he called out to wild cheers. But he also asked people to forgive, saying, ''We must respond to violence with love.''
The doctor's friends say United Nations officials and the Congolese authorities have reassured Dr. Mukwege that he is now safe in Bukavu, which is why he returned to continue his work.
The authorities in Bukavu said there is nothing to worry about. ''Our methods are invisible, but we will protect him,'' said Etienne Babunga, a local security official. ''Anyway, who would want to kill him? He's just a doctor.''

As the article correctly noted, he is with Mayors Against Illegal Guns, not Mayors Against Gun Violence. (His group is pushing the Obama administration to strengthen the enforcement of background checks.)

Shots Fired Into Offices Of Greek Governing Party

BYLINE: By LIZ ALDERMAN; Niki Kitsantonis contributed reporting.

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 4

LENGTH: 610 words

ATHENS -- Unidentified gunmen sprayed bullets into the headquarters of Greece's governing New Democracy party in central Athens before dawn on Monday, adding to a wave of politically motivated violence in recent days as Greece struggles with its worst economic crisis in a decade.
No one was injured in the attack, in which one bullet entered the office of Prime Minister Antonis Samaras. 
Though there was no public claim of responsibility for the shooting, the episode followed a spate of attacks on other symbols of the Greek establishment that are believed to have been carried out by far-left militant groups. Those attacks over the last week involved canister bombs detonated at several government offices, banks and the homes of five prominent journalists in Athens.
A government spokesman warned on Monday of a ''dangerous escalation of spreading terror.''
Taken together, the episodes pointed to a rise in activism by far-left militant groups, after a similar rise over the past year on the far right, where the neofascist group Golden Dawn has carried out a series of attacks against immigrants.
Mr. Samaras's fragile coalition government has been rocked recently by accusations that it has failed to pursue rampant tax evasion by the wealthy and well-connected. The publication of a list of more than 2,000 Greeks with bank accounts in Switzerland, which the government was given but did little to investigate, has touched off a scandal and galvanized public opinion in recent weeks.
The opposition Syriza party, which until recently was ahead of Mr. Samaras's bloc in opinion polls, has sought to capitalize on public anger by pressing a series of parliamentary investigations into the matter. The party's lead shrank when Mr. Samaras secured a payment of almost $47 billion from Greece's international lenders last month, part of a bailout plan that Syriza has said it would try to scuttle if it wins power.
Mr. Samaras, for his part, has pointed to outbreaks of violence as warnings of what could happen to the country if he were not in charge. ''Democracy will not be terrorized,'' he said on Monday.
All of Greece's opposition parties, including Syriza, Independent Greeks, Golden Dawn and the Communist Party, condemned the shooting attack on Monday.
Urban political violence has tended to flare in Greece at moments of political chaos and economic deterioration. A group called November 17 mounted terrorist attacks against politicians and businessmen for decades after the fall of the country's military junta in 1974; the police finally crushed that group in 2002, but others have sprung up since then, including anarchist groups that have sown chaos by attacking the police and throwing firebombs during anti-austerity demonstrations.
The latest wave of violence began after dozens of suspected anarchists were arrested last week in a raid at the Villa Amalia, a longtime gathering point in central Athens for far-left groups and students. Firebombs were confiscated in the raid.
Security guards at Mr. Samaras's party offices saw two men emerge from a car shortly before 3 a.m. Monday and open fire, the police said. The offices were empty.
State television reported on Monday that antiterrorism officers had joined the investigation, but the police did not publicly speculate about who might have been responsible for the shooting.
A string of attacks involving homemade gas canister bombs on Friday that targeted five journalists was claimed by an anarchist group called Militant Minority-Lovers of Lawlessness. It cited Greek news media coverage that it saw as sympathetic to the austerity drive imposed by the government and its international creditors.

New York Has Gun Deal, With Focus on Mental Ills; Obama's Plan to Be Broad: Willingness to Use Executive Orders to Take Action

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR and JENNIFER STEINHAUER

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 1

WASHINGTON -- President Obama this week will embrace a comprehensive plan to reduce gun violence that will call for major legislation to expand background checks for gun purchases and lay out 19 separate actions the president could take by invoking the power of his office, lawmakers who were briefed on the plan said Monday.
Lawmakers and other officials said that the president could use a public event as soon as Wednesday to signal his intention to engage in the biggest Congressional fight over guns in nearly two decades, focusing on the heightened background checks and including efforts to ban assault weapons and their high-capacity clips. But given the difficulty of pushing new rules through a bitterly divided Congress, Mr. Obama will also promise to act on his own to reduce gun violence wherever possible. 
Actions the president could take on his own are likely to include imposing new limits on guns imported from overseas, compelling federal agencies to improve sharing of mental health records and directing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct research on gun violence, according to those briefed on the effort.
White House aides believe Mr. Obama can also ratchet up enforcement of existing laws, including tougher prosecution of people who lie on their background checks.
At a news conference on Monday, exactly one month after the school massacre in Newtown, Conn., Mr. Obama said a task force led by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. had ''presented me now with a list of sensible, common-sense steps that can be taken to make sure that the kinds of violence we saw at Newtown doesn't happen again. He added: ''My starting point is not to worry about the politics. My starting point is to focus on what makes sense, what works.''
The administration's strategy reflects the uncertainty of gun politics in America and the desire by White House officials to address the Connecticut shooting while also confronting the broader deficiencies in the country's criminal justice and mental health systems.
By proposing to use the independent power of his office, Mr. Obama is inviting political attacks by gun owners who have already expressed fear that he will abuse that authority to restrict their rights. Representative Steve Stockman, Republican of Texas, threatened Monday to file articles of impeachment if the president seeks to regulate guns with executive orders. ''I will seek to thwart this action by any means necessary,'' Mr. Stockman said in a statement.
White House officials and Democratic lawmakers said that there are clear limits to what the president can and cannot do, and that Mr. Obama has no plans to push beyond what he would need Congressional authority to accomplish.
On Capitol Hill, Mr. Obama's legislative effort will face intense opposition from gun rights groups, including the National Rifle Association, and the lawmakers they support with millions of dollars at election time and who see gun rights as a defining issue in their districts. But Mr. Obama's allies see a rare opening for tighter gun rules after Congress has shied away from the politically charged issue for years.
''He's putting together a pretty comprehensive list of what could be done to make a difference in this area,'' said Representative Mike Thompson of California, who is heading a Democratic task force in the House. ''There's some huge, huge holes in the process that are set up to keep communities safe. We need to close those holes.''
Representative Jackie Speier, Democrat of California, said Vice President Biden had informed lawmakers during a two-hour briefing on Monday that there are ''19 independent steps that the president can take by executive order.'' Ms. Speier said the executive action is part of the ''most comprehensive gun safety effort in a generation.''
Rahm Emanuel, the mayor of Chicago and Mr. Obama's former chief of staff, joined the debate on Monday and said that the president should ''clear the table'' by doing whatever he can administratively so small issues do not get in the way of the bigger legislative fights over access to guns.
''Don't allow a side issue to derail these things,'' Mr. Emanuel said during a discussion about gun policy. While many gun control advocates are eager to harness what they believe is a ripe moment in American life for new and robust restrictions on the kinds of guns that were used in Newtown, there is an emerging consensus on Capitol Hill and among gun education groups that improving the system of background check legislation that currently exempts private gun sales and gun shows is the most viable legislative route to pursue.
''The assault-weapons ban is a low priority relative to the other measures the Biden task force is considering,'' Matt Bennett, a spokesman for Third Way, a left-leaning research group, said after hearing from Mr. Biden last week. ''Political capital in the gun debate only goes so far. We think it should be spent on things that would have the greatest impact on gun violence, like universal background checks and cracking down on gun trafficking.''
Any efforts to get gun legislation through Congress will require an enormous and ceaseless pressure campaign by the administration. Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden are likely to keep up the pressure on lawmakers with public events in the weeks and months ahead, according to those familiar with the White House strategy.
Scores of senators, including many Democrats, will be wary of voting on any effort to curb access to guns or ammunition. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, is a longtime supporter of gun rights. Still, gun legislation is likely to begin in the Senate because the House is controlled by Republicans, many of whom oppose new restrictions on guns.
With fiscal issues continuing to dominate the political calendar for the next several weeks, White House officials and lawmakers say the gun safety effort is likely to be debated in separate pieces of legislation that could be introduced over time. In coming weeks, Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, will reintroduce a measure that would require every gun buyer, with limited exceptions, to undergo a background check and would force states to feed all relevant data into the background check system so those with criminal convictions and the mentally ill could be flagged.

Families of Newtown Victims Organize Violence Prevention Effort

BYLINE: By RAY RIVERA

NEWTOWN, Conn. -- Nelba Marquez-Greene put her two children on the school bus on the morning of Dec. 14. Only one came home.
Nicole Hockley still finds herself reaching for her son's hand in parking lots, or expects ''him to crawl into my bed for early-morning cuddles before school.''
''It's so hard to believe he's gone,'' she said. 
The grieving mothers and other parents and relatives of victims killed in the Dec. 14 elementary school massacre gathered here at a news conference on Monday to help begin a campaign intended to prevent the kind of bloodshed that has turned this quiet New England community into a national symbol of grief.
In some of their first public statements since the shooting, which killed 20 children and 6 staff members at Sandy Hook Elementary School, the families of 11 of the victims called for a national dialogue on issues of mental health, school safety and what their nonprofit group, called Sandy Hook Promise, described as ''gun responsibility.''
The gathering came as President Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. prepared to unveil gun-control proposals as soon as Tuesday that are expected to call for a ban on the kind of assault weapon and high-capacity ammunition magazines used by Adam Lanza in the Newtown shooting.
But perhaps foreshadowing the difficult and contentious debates to come in Washington, group members declined to offer support for any specific measures, saying they needed time to educate themselves on the issues, and emphasizing that the debate must be broader than gun control.
''It's only been 30 days, and for the past 30 days we've really been looking inward and supporting our community,'' said Tim Makris, a founder of the group who had a fourth-grade son at the school, who was not hurt.
''We love the focus of the president,'' he added, ''and we love that the vice president reached out recently to talk directly to the families that chose to meet with him. But we don't have an immediate response right now.''
Tom Bittman, another founder, who has children who previously attended the school, said that many of the group members were gun owners.
''We hunt, we target shoot,'' he said. ''We protect our homes. We're collectors. We teach our sons and daughters how to use guns safely. We're not afraid of a national conversation in our community and in Congress about responsibility and accountability. We know there are millions of people in this nation who agree with us.''
The news conference, which included other members of the Newtown community, was the first time a group of Sandy Hook families spoke publicly about the tragedy.
The families filed onstage, inside the Edmond Town Hall, holding hands and wearing green and white ribbons, the school's colors. Some held photographs of their children. As they sat onstage, some wiped away tears.
''I hope that no parent, grandparent or caregiver of children ever has to go through that pain,'' said Ms. Marquez-Greene, whose 6-year-old daughter, Ana, died that day. Ana's father, Jimmy Greene, sat clutching a large photograph of his smiling, curly-haired daughter as his wife spoke.
Jeremy Richman and Jennifer Hensel, the parents of Avielle Richman, 6, who was killed, said they had started a foundation in her name to focus on research to identify ''risk factors and measure success of mental health interventions.''
''Like everyone here, we want to bring about changes that will stop a tragedy such as this from happening to any community again,'' Mr. Richman said, as he choked back tears.
David and Francine Wheeler, whose son Benjamin, 6, was killed, explained why they joined the campaign.
''I am not done being the best parent I can be for Ben,'' Mr. Wheeler said. ''Not by a very long measure. If there is something in our society that clearly needs to be fixed or healed or resolved, that resolution needs a point of origin. It needs parents.''
While it was clear the parents and family members were still grasping for answers themselves, they have now joined a sad fraternity of people who have lost loved ones in such tragedies.
Ms. Hockley's son Dylan, 6, was found dead cradled in the arms of his favorite school aide, Anne Marie Murphy, who died apparently trying to shield him. Ms. Hockley said that she had felt ''honored'' to meet with the families of victims of past mass shootings like those at Columbine and Virginia Tech.
But, she added, she did not want to be someone ''sharing her experience and consoling parents'' the next time such a shooting occurred.
''I do not want there to be a next time,'' she said.

New York Has Gun Deal, With Focus on Mental Ills; Obama's Plan to Be Broad: State Lawmakers Approve Bill by 43 to 18

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN and DANNY HAKIM

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 1

ALBANY -- Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and lawmakers agreed on Monday to a broad package of changes to gun laws that would expand the state's ban on assault weapons and would include new measures to keep guns away from the mentally ill.
The state Senate, controlled by a coalition of Republicans and a handful of Democrats, approved the legislative package just after 11 p.m. by a lopsided vote of 43 to 18. The Assembly, where Democrats who have been strongly supportive of gun control have an overwhelming majority, planned to vote on the measure Tuesday.
Approval of the legislation would make New York the first state to act in response to the mass shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., last month.
Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, had pressed lawmakers to move quickly in response to Newtown, saying, ''the people of this state are crying out for help.'' And the Legislature proceeded with unusual haste: Monday was the first full day of this year's legislative session. 
''We don't need another tragedy to point out the problems in the system,'' Mr. Cuomo said at a news conference.
''Enough people have lost their lives,'' he added. ''Let's act.''
The expanded ban on assault weapons would broaden the definition of such weapons, banning semiautomatic pistols and rifles with detachable magazines and one military-style feature, as well as semiautomatic shotguns with one military-style feature. New Yorkers who already own such guns could keep them but would be required to register them with the state.
''The message out there is so clear after Newtown,'' said the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Democrat from Manhattan. ''To basically eradicate assault weapons from our streets in New York as quickly as possible is something the people of this state want.''
In an acknowledgment that many people have suggested that part of the solution to gun violence is a better government response to mental illness, the legislation includes not only new restrictions on gun ownership, but also efforts to limit access to guns by the mentally ill.
The most significant new proposal would require mental health professionals to report to local mental health officials when they believe that patients are likely to harm themselves or others. Law enforcement would then be authorized to confiscate any firearm owned by a dangerous patient; therapists would not be sanctioned for a failure to report such patients if they acted ''in good faith.''
''People who have mental health issues should not have guns,'' Mr. Cuomo told reporters. ''They could hurt themselves, they could hurt other people.''
But such a requirement ''represents a major change in the presumption of confidentiality that has been inherent in mental health treatment,'' said Dr. Paul S. Appelbaum, the director of the Division of Law, Ethics, and Psychiatry at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, who said the Legislature should hold hearings on possible consequences of the proposal.
''The prospect of being reported to the local authorities, even if they do not have weapons, may be enough to discourage patients with suicidal or homicidal thoughts from seeking treatment or from being honest about their impulses,'' he said.
The legislation would extend and expand Kendra's Law, which empowers judges to order mentally ill patients to receive outpatient treatment.
And it would require gun owners to keep weapons inaccessible in homes where a resident has been involuntarily committed, convicted of a crime or is the subject of an order of protection.
The legislative package, which Mr. Cuomo said he believed would be ''the most comprehensive package in the nation,'' would ban any gun magazine that can hold over 7 rounds of ammunition -- the current limit is 10 rounds. It would also require background checks of ammunition buyers and automated alerts to law enforcement of high-volume purchases.
The legislation would increase penalties for multiple crimes committed with guns, would require background checks for most private gun sales, and create a statewide gun-registration database.
Senator Jeffrey D. Klein of the Bronx, the leader of an independent faction of Democrats who have allied with the Republicans to control the Senate, said the measure met the goals of many lawmakers.
''Republicans, it's very clear, wanted harsher criminal penalties for illegal guns, which is something I agree with,'' Mr. Klein added, ''but on the other hand we're also going to ban assault weapons and limit the number of rounds in a magazine. So I think putting those two things together makes it a better bill.''
Among the other elements of the proposed legislation were a so-called Webster provision, named for the shooting deaths of two firefighters in Webster, near Rochester, just before Christmas. The provision would mandate a life sentence without parole for anyone who murders a first responder.
And, in response to a controversy that erupted after The Journal News, a daily newspaper, published the names and addresses of handgun permit holders in Westchester and Rockland Counties, the legislation would prohibit disclosure of the names in the new statewide gun-registration database, and would allow individuals to exempt their own names and addresses from being disclosed by counties that have such databases.
The guns package was negotiated privately by the governor and legislative leaders over the last several weeks, but was only completed late Monday; rank-and-file Senators had only a few minutes to read the legislation before voting on it. Mr. Cuomo, saying, ''If there is an issue that fits the definition of necessity, I believe it's gun violence,'' waived the normal three-day waiting period between introduction of new legislation and a vote.
The minority leader in the Assembly, Brian M. Kolb, a Republican from Canandaigua, objected to the move to expedite the process, saying, ''I don't think we should be rushing things just for the sake of headlines.''
By the time the Senate began to discuss the bill late Monday night, the galleries that overlook the chamber were mostly empty of spectators. A parade of Democrats, who have long pressed for new gun laws, rose to praise the bill as they explained their votes.
Senator Malcolm A. Smith, an independent Democrat from Queens, said provisions of the measure could be dedicated to the family members of New Yorkers who had been victims of gun violence.
''I think today we are setting the mark for the rest of the country,'' he said.
Most of the senators who voted against the bill did not speak. One who did, Senator Kathleen A. Marchione, a Republican from Saratoga County, praised some parts of the measure, like the expansion of Kendra's Law. But she said the new restrictions on guns would not get at the problem of gun violence.
''I truly believe that the Second Amendment constitutional freedoms of every New Yorker tonight has been weakened,'' she said, adding, ''Law-abiding citizens who own guns are not our problem. Law-abiding citizens understand and know how to take care of their guns, not to be a danger to others.''

As Shostakovich Found Out, Mother Russia Can Be Tough

Memory is an active muse, as demanding as an Olympics gymnastics coach, in ''Opus No. 7,'' a suitably unforgettable work from the Dmitry Krymov Lab and the Moscow Theater of Dramatic Arts. In this thrillingly inventive production, which runs at St. Ann's Warehouse in Brooklyn through Sunday, performers in search of lost time find themselves faced with a herculean array of obstacles and chimera.
They are beckoned by (and sometimes obliged to wrestle with) bodiless phantom arms that slide into the sleeves of empty jackets. They are blasted by a gale-force, stage-blanketing storm of confetti, bearing the names and images of nearly forgotten ancestors. 
Most dauntingly, in the show's second half, they are forced to do the bidding of steely, capricious Mother Russia, a figure who looms large, very large, in the form of a 12-foot puppet with a bosom as big as the Urals. And that's not to mention the poor guy who has to function as a human chandelier. Or that little composer chap -- What's his name? Oh yeah, Shostakovich -- who is lanced, roasted, shot at and turned into a taxidermy specimen.
Sentimentality takes many forms, but they're rarely as invigorating as those delivered by ''Opus No. 7,'' a genre-blending performance piece in two, hourlong parts. Mr. Krymov, who conceived and directed the show, began his career as a set designer. And he brings both an artist's and an artisan's skills to this show, in which the actors use paint, postures, voices, saws, hammers and nails to reconfigure an elusive past.
''Genealogy,'' the first section, is a spirited, lyrical sיance of sorts, in which the ghosts of long-disappeared Russian Jews are summoned into being. The blank, begrimed white space that has been made of the St. Ann's stage doesn't at first look like an auspicious site for such explorations. But then you don't know what's in those grungy buckets at center stage, or what's lurking behind the paneled wall, or just how convertible the black concert clothes worn by the performers are.
These actor-singer-musicians use black paint, knives, staplers, hard candy and shredded paper to ascend creative DIY heights that Martha Stewart never dreamed of. (Vera Martynova is the stage designer.) Aided by projected images that seem to hover between dimensions -- and the witty mystical music of Alexander Bakshi (love the name-checking scat number) -- the performers suggest bewildered, tenacious pioneers trying to hack their way into a tangled collective past.
''Genealogy'' tingles with the sensation we sometimes experience going through boxes of old family memorabilia, when we try to will ourselves into feeling what the people in faded photographs felt when the pictures were taken. If we all had the enterprise and resourcefulness of Mr. Krymov and company, we might come a little closer to achieving that communion.
The second part, designed by Maria Tregubova, is a relatively straightforward allegory, though none the less ingenious in its execution. The subject is the great composer and pianist Dmitri Shostakovich (1906-75). Played by the impish and indefatigable Anna Sinyakina, Shostakovich is presented as an eternally beleaguered little man, struggling to create -- and to stay alive -- in a Soviet culture that did not take kindly to independent-minded artists.
Mr. Krymov has said that his vision of Shostakovich was partly inspired by Charlie Chaplin's beleaguered Little Tramp. There is certainly a Chaplin-esque verve in the way Ms. Sinyakina does physical battle with pianos, which take on a multitude of incarnations (a giant sawhorse piano, a fire-breathing piano, an army of battered metal pianos).
Overseeing little Shostakovich's trials and tribulations is the immense female puppet, who is at least twice his size, and whose attitudes toward her protיgי range from that of a fond, protective mother to a gun-wielding military assassin.
While the recorded voice of the real Shostakovich is heard, spouting Soviet propaganda, this work is no head-shaking satire of an artist who buckled under to the state. Or not only that. Deploying comic devices, Mr. Krymov makes us feel the human tragedy of one gifted man's life. He reminds us that in trying to recapture the past, empathy may be the most essential tool of all.

Concession After Days Of Protest In Pakistan

BYLINE: By DECLAN WALSH; Salman Masood contributed reporting.

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 11

LENGTH: 949 words

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- For years, residents of the impoverished and violence-riven province of Baluchistan have complained about their chief minister, angry that he was enjoying a lavish lifestyle in Pakistan's capital even while their province slid deeper into a quagmire of militant attacks, state repression and sectarian bloodshed.
That anger boiled over last week after suicide bombers killed almost 100 people from the ethnic Hazara minority in Quetta, the province's main city. Yet the chief minister, Mohammed Aslam Raisani, failed to return home from a visit in Britain. Hazara mourners protested in the streets for days, refusing to bury the victims until Mr. Raisani and his administration were removed. For three nights grieving relatives slept in the street alongside rows of coffins, braving bitterly cold weather and inspiring other protests across Pakistan. 
Finally, in the early hours of Monday, the Pakistani government relented. During a visit to the bomb site, a destroyed snooker hall, Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf announced that Mr. Raisani had been dismissed, the provincial Parliament had been dissolved and control of the province was being handed to its governor, Nawab Zulfiqar Ali Magsi.
Hours later, Hazara families started to bury their dead.
Mr. Raisani's ouster was a significant concession by President Asif Ali Zardari, who had previously resisted pressure from senior judges to fire Mr. Raisani and whose government, even more troublingly, has failed to stem an intensifying campaign of militant violence against the Hazara and other Shiites, who are estimated to make up 20 percent of Pakistan's 180 million people.
The crisis in Baluchistan and the sudden political moves added to a sense that events in Pakistan, volatile at the best of times, were suddenly coming to a head in the months before planned national elections this spring.
Violence has recently surged: on the day of the attack on Hazaras last week, Baluch nationalists killed 12 soldiers in a bombing in Quetta, while people suspected of being part of the Taliban killed 22 in the northwestern Swat Valley. In the coastal megalopolis of Karachi, tensions between political parties have led to daily tit-for-tat shootings. And in the mountains of Kashmir, unexpected clashes between Pakistani and Indian soldiers have strained diplomatic relations that were just starting to look up.
Adding to the sense of siege for Mr. Zardari's government, a firebrand Islamic preacher, Muhammad Tahir-ul Qadri, led tens of thousands of supporters into the heart of Islamabad in the early hours of Tuesday for a rally that he promised would ''revolutionize'' Pakistani politics.
The cavalcade had spent 38 hours traveling across Punjab, the country's most populous province; upon reaching central Islamabad, Mr. Qadri, speaking from behind a bulletproof glass screen, issued an ultimatum to Mr. Zardari's government: dissolve the Parliament by morning and make way for a caretaker administration, or face a ''people's democratic revolution.''
''There will be justice tomorrow,'' he told the crowd in a thundering voice, before ordering the government to allow his supporters to camp outside the gates of Parliament. There was no immediate government reaction.
Later Tuesday, security forces used tear gas and fired shots in the air as supporters of Mr. Qadri hurled stones at them, Reuters reported. His spokesman told Reuters that the crowd had prevented government forces from arresting the preacher.
Mr. Qadri is something of a mystery figure, little known in Pakistan until his return from Canada -- he is a citizen of both countries -- one month ago. He has elicited loud suspicions that he is a proxy for Pakistan's powerful generals, who disdain both Mr. Zardari and his main political rival, Nawaz Sharif, yet are considered too weak at present to take over power themselves.
''The establishment is playing its cards in an attempt to become stakeholders in the election process,'' said Najam Sethi, a veteran political analyst. ''They do not want to give Zardari and Nawaz a clear run.''
Yet there is little doubt that Mr. Qadri and his sponsors, whoever they may be, are tapping into a rich vein of popular discontent, amid soaring inflation and a crumbling economy.
Among those who traveled with Mr. Qadri to Islamabad was Shahid Ali, 35, from Gujrat. ''Poverty has killed us, and politicians have abandoned people like me,'' he said, pausing along the journey. ''But Qadri understands Islam. He feels for the poor.''
The intense domestic news media focus on Mr. Qadri contrasted sharply with the relatively light coverage accorded to Shiites in Baluchistan, who say they have felt ignored, at best, by Pakistan's political mainstream despite the horrific violence they have suffered.
Since the Quetta bombing, the Pakistani government has promised greater military muscle to hunt down the Sunni death squads, led by extremist groups like Lashkar-e-Jhangvi. But in reality, the military already controls security policy in Baluchistan, where its main focus is quelling a Baluch nationalist revolt, which has gone on for years. To this end, human rights groups say, the military has abducted and killed many Baluch nationalists, but has also used jihadi militants to work on its behalf.
The army denies such accusations. Still, few sectarian killers have been arrested, much less convicted, in recent years. And the leader of Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, Malik Ishaq, roams the country freely, giving interviews and addressing supporters.
''I am not good at giving speeches,'' he was reported to have told a crowd in Karachi last week, the day after the snooker hall killing in Quetta. ''But you know what I am good at.''

A Poorer San Bernardino, and a More Dangerous One, Too

BYLINE: By IAN LOVETT

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 12

LENGTH: 1040 words

SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. -- The gunshots ripped through a house party here, an hour before midnight on New Year's Eve, wounding three and killing one. It was a brutal, if fitting, cap to a year that left this city bloody and broke.
Five months after San Bernardino filed for bankruptcy -- the third California city to seek Chapter 9 protections in 2012 -- residents here are confronting a transformed and more perilous city. 
After violent crime had dropped steadily for years, the homicide rate shot up more than 50 percent in 2012 as a shrinking police force struggled to keep order in a city long troubled by street gangs that have migrated from Los Angeles, 60 miles to the west.
''Lock your doors and load your guns,'' the city attorney, James F. Penman, said he routinely told worried residents asking how they can protect themselves.
This is one of the prices that cities often pay for falling into bankruptcy: the police force is cut, crime skyrockets and residents are left trying to ensure their own safety.
A little over a year ago, this city's falling crime rate was a success story. An aggressive gang intervention effort helped cut the homicide rate by nearly half since the 2005 peak, and in 2011 the program was held up by the National League of Cities as a model for other cities to follow.
But nearly all that progress was erased last year as San Bernardino collapsed under the weight of the same forces that have hit cities all over California and threaten to plunge still more of them into insolvency: high foreclosure rates that eroded the city's tax revenue, stubborn unemployment, and pension obligations that the city could no longer afford.
Stockton, Calif., which filed for bankruptcy in June, has followed a similarly grim path into insolvency, logging more homicides last year than ever before. In Vallejo, Calif., which filed for bankruptcy in 2008, cuts left the police force a third smaller, and the city became a hub for prostitution.
In San Bernardino, dozens of officers have been laid off since the bankruptcy filing, leaving the police force with 264 officers, down from 350 in 2009. Those who remain call in sick more often, said the police chief, Robert Handy. Emergency response times are up. Nonemergency calls often get no response.
At the same time, as part of a plan to reduce the state prison population, nearly 4,000 criminals who would once have been sent to state prison have been put in the custody of San Bernardino County law enforcement authorities. Some have been released, putting more low-level criminals back on the streets of San Bernardino, Chief Hardy said, and adding to the challenges already faced by the police.
''All of our crime is up, and the city has a very high crime rate per capita anyway,'' Chief Handy said. ''I can't police the city with much less than this. We're dangerously close as it is.''
As lawyers wrangle in court over San Bernardino's plan to cut $26 million from its budget and defer some of its pension payments, city officials say there is little more they can do to turn back the rising tide of violence.
Mayor Patrick J. Morris said he was even looking into eliminating the Police Department entirely, and relying on the county Sheriff's Department for law enforcement, which could save money. Many other city services, he said, have already been cut ''almost into nonexistence.''
''The parks department is shredded, the libraries similarly,'' Mr. Morris said. ''My office is down to nobody. I've got literally no one left.'' (Mr. Morris's son now serves as a volunteer chief of staff for the mayor's office.)
With the city unable to provide, residents have begun to take more responsibility. Volunteers help with park maintenance, work at the city animal shelter and, in some cases, even replace broken streetlights.
Neighborhood watch groups have also grown in number in the last year, as they did in Vallejo and Stockton after those cities filed for bankruptcy. There are now more than 100 groups and counting, up from 76 last year. Chief Handy said the groups would play a ''huge part'' in fighting crime, especially given the cut to the police.
In less affluent parts of the city, though, community groups have had less influence. On the West Side, traditionally a gang-controlled area, one resident, Elisa Cortez, said that almost all the neighbors on her block had recently moved in, and that she did not know them.
On a recent Saturday, Ms. Cortez repeatedly called the city about a stray dog that lay dead on the sidewalk just outside her house. No one came. ''We can't get ahold of anybody to get rid of it,'' she said.
The city is still doing regular trash collection -- at least for now -- if not dead animal removal. But after 15 years driving a garbage truck here, Carlos Teran does not know if the city will have enough money to pay him next month. His payroll is now month-to-month, he said.
Mr. Teran owes more than $200,000 on a house in Bloods gang territory that is now worth closer to $50,000, he said.
Up the street, a tree-lined avenue with views of the nearby foothills, four candles marked the spot where a gang member was killed in a drive-by shooting. Across the street, metal thieves have gutted one of the foreclosed homes that dot the neighborhood, ripping air conditioners and electrical boxes off the walls long before the police responded.
''It's scary,'' said Mr. Teran's wife, Elizabeth. ''You hear gunshots. You have to watch your surroundings.''
Some of Mr. Teran's co-workers, even the ones who have not been laid off, have left San Bernardino. The Terans, who both grew up here, have considered doing the same, walking away from their underwater mortgage and moving their five children to a place where they can leave the house wearing their blue soccer shirts without fear.
But they have decided to stay. Mr. Teran is the block captain for a neighborhood watch group that also cleans up a park every month. Like other residents in the rougher parts of San Bernardino, he said he knew the area well enough to feel safe here.
''I know people say this is a shameful city, one of the worst places to live, one of the worst cities to raise your kids,'' Mr. Teran said. ''But down deep in my heart, I love this city. And one day it will turn around.''

Judge Finds California Boy Responsible in the Killing of His Neo-Nazi Father

BYLINE: By IAN LOVETT

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 14

LENGTH: 662 words

RIVERSIDE, Calif. -- The young son of a neo-Nazi knew right from wrong when he shot and killed his father, and he is therefore responsible for second-degree murder, a judge ruled on Monday.
Joseph Hall was 10 years old when he shot his sleeping father in the head in 2011. Now 12, he could be held in state custody until age 23.
Because Joseph was so young at the time of the murder, the case hinged on whether he understood that shooting his father, Jeffrey Hall, 32, was wrong. 
The judge, Jean P. Leonard of Riverside County Superior Court, said that after the shooting, Joseph put the gun under his bed; he did not cry when the police arrived, even as other family members were sobbing; and testimony indicated that he might have told his younger sister days before that he planned to shoot their father.
''These actions show the court that he knew his actions were wrong and did not want to get caught,'' Judge Leonard said in court Monday.
The trial, which began in October but was delayed for months and resumed last week, offered a rare glance into the life of a young boy whose family hosted monthly neo-Nazi meetings at their home.
Joseph had been violent since he was a young child, according to testimony, beginning before his father joined the National Socialist Movement. Joseph hit his sisters and his stepmother, stabbed classmates at school with pencils and once tried to strangle a teacher with a telephone cord.
After he had been kicked out of half a dozen schools for violent behavior, his stepmother, Krista McCary, and Mr. Hall home-schooled him, Ms. McCary testified at the trial.
''He was very impulsive and very violent towards the other children and teachers,'' Ms. McCary said. ''Hitting, kicking, biting, scratching, stabbing with sharp objects, hitting with objects.''
Mr. Hall also beat Joseph regularly for years before the murder, the judge said on Monday.
Michael Soccio, the chief deputy district attorney, said he hoped the court would get Joseph help. ''Joseph is a little boy, and his life has been very, very sad,'' Mr. Soccio said after the ruling. But he added: ''I also would have been concerned had Joseph been released. I think he's a very dangerous boy.''
Sitting quietly in court, slight and blond and wearing glasses and a button-down shirt, Joseph showed no visible reaction when the judge found the allegations against him -- the murder charge and one count of using a firearm -- to be true. He is scheduled to return to court next month, when Judge Leonard will most likely determine where he will be sent.
If he ends up in state custody, Joseph would be the youngest person in the State Division of Juvenile Justice, which houses minors who have committed serious crimes, a state official said.
Matthew J. Hardy, the public defender representing Joseph, said it would be ''a complete tragedy'' if the boy were sent to state custody. Mr. Hardy said he planned to appeal the ruling.
Mr. Hardy had argued that the environment in the Hall home glorified violence and that, given his young age, left Joseph unable to understand right from wrong. During the trial, Mr. Hardy showed a photograph of Joseph holding a toy gun, giving a Nazi salute and smiling beside a hooded Klansman.
The day before the murder, a reporter attended a neo-Nazi gathering at the Hall home. During the meeting, Joseph sat quietly on the stairs. He said he was having fun, even showing off a new belt bearing a Nazi insignia.
Around 4 a.m. the next day, Joseph pulled his father's .357 handgun -- which he called ''the bad gun,'' the judge said -- down from the shelf in his parents' bedroom. He walked downstairs, where his father lay sleeping on the couch, and shot Mr. Hall in the head.
After the police arrived, Joseph was escorted to a squad car, where he talked with Officer Michael Foster. He asked questions like ''Do people get more than one life?'' Officer Foster said.
''He was sad about it,'' Officer Foster said in testimony. ''He wished he hadn't done it.''

An autopsy showed that Kansas City Chiefs linebacker Jovan Belcher was drunk when he shot his girlfriend, Kasandra Perkins, and then killed himself last month in Missouri. Belcher's blood-alcohol level was 0.17, and was probably higher at the time of the shooting. The legal limit in the state is 0.08 percent.

The Moment for Action on Guns

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; EDITORIAL; Pg. 22

LENGTH: 583 words

The next few weeks represent a once-in-a-generation opportunity to harden the nation's gun laws and reduce the threat of rapid-fire violence in America. A month after the slaughter of 20 children and seven adults in Newtown, Conn., Vice President Joseph Biden Jr.'s commission is about to present a series of recommendations for new laws, and it is vital that his panel gets it right and that Congress immediately takes action on its report.
Federal laws on guns have been kept so lax, for so long, that the Biden panel could suggest scores of ways to improve public safety. But there are a few policies that clearly have to be in any serious legislative package, the first two of which were endorsed on Monday by President Obama: requiring criminal and mental-health background checks on every gun buyer, including sales from individuals; a ban on military-style assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines; a strong statute prohibiting gun trafficking; and an end to the hobbling of the federal agency that enforces gun laws. 
The need for background checks on every gun buyer has never been greater, now that the Internet has made it easy for private individuals to buy and sell guns without screening. The reason that both the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and Mayors Against Illegal Guns have made universal background checks their top priority is that 40 percent of gun sales now take place privately, including most guns that are later used in crimes.
Requiring background checks at gun shows, parking-lot sales and Web sites would reduce the cash-and-carry anonymity of millions of gun transactions, putting buyers on notice that their sale is being recorded and can be traced. It is largely supported by legitimate gun dealers, who already have to conduct the checks and have long grumbled about competition from those who do not. And it would have no effect on law-abiding buyers who want a hunting rifle or a handgun to keep at home.
Such a law should be supplemented by a presidential order requiring federal and state agencies to contribute to the background check system with criminal and mental health information. Federal prosecutors, who have a dismal record of pursuing charges against those who lie on a gun application, need to enforce the system vigorously.
The assault weapons ban that expired in 2004 should be renewed and tightened, with a special emphasis on prohibiting magazines that hold more than 10 rounds. The millions who already own such weapons -- unnecessary for hunting or protection -- should be required to register them and submit to a background check to reduce the mass killing that produced this agonized debate.
A new law is needed to crack down on the trafficking of guns that an individual has reason to know will be used in a crime, increasing penalties and making it easier to track corrupt gun dealers. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives needs to have a permanent director, more financing and expanded authority to inspect dealers, and an end to restrictions that keep it from tracking all gun sales and retaining background-check data. Some lawmakers are already talking about focusing on the background checks and bowing to gun lobby's opposition to an assault weapons ban. That shouldn't stop the administration and its allies from demanding that all these provisions be passed immediately. With the deaths of Newtown's children still so fresh, the public will be repulsed by lawmakers who stand aside and do nothing.

A part-time student strode into the office of a longtime administrator at Stevens Institute of Business and Arts in St. Louis on Tuesday and shot the man in the chest, before turning the gun on himself, the police said. A hospital spokesman declined to discuss their conditions. Police Chief Sam Dotson said the suspect had no history of threats or violence. He said the gunman apparently sought out the victim.

WASHINGTON
President Standoffish doesn't want to be seen as a stiff.
''Most people who know me know I'm a pretty friendly guy,'' he protested at his White House press conference on Monday. ''And I like a good party.''
Maybe. But the president always seems to be dancing alone. And that was the vibe of his swan-song press conference for Act One of his presidency. 
His words were laced with an edge -- churlish, chiding and self-pitying. He sardonically presented himself as Lonely Guy, shafted by the opposition, kicking around the White House on his own. Days before his second inauguration, he seemed to be intimating that the job he had fought so hard for and won against all odds was a bit of a chore, if not a bore.
When the man who once enraptured packed stadiums was asked by The Times's Jackie Calmes about the criticism that his administration has been too insular, he bristled a tad.
He acknowledged, while conveying that he didn't believe it, that he could ''do a better job'' on nurturing personal relationships with lawmakers. (Even if Republicans see him, as Politico's Glenn Thrush wrote, as ''a pedantic, hectoring fuss-budget.'')
''Now that my girls are getting older, they don't want to spend that much time with me anyway,'' he said, as reporters laughed, ''so I'll be probably calling around, looking for somebody to play cards with me or something, because I'm getting kind of lonely in this big house. So maybe a whole bunch of members of the House Republican caucus want to come over and socialize more.''
Some Democrats wish he would start a regular game in the Indian Treaty Room so he could work on his poker face. Others are ready for a Bridget Jones approach: Love the president the way he is. Time to go with the flow.
''He doesn't reach out very well,'' one told me. ''People should get over it.''
It is striking how subdued the mood is as the president heads into his second inauguration party.
At his first one, the nation's capital was suffused with passion and wonder and dreams, nearly two million hope-besotted faces beaming up at the new president, hoping he could save their shirts, shrieking with delight as W.'s helicopter flew away over the Capitol.
Now the thrill is dimmed, with a series of grinding, petty fights ahead. Certainly, there's a sense among Democrats that they're happy Obama is president; the race was close enough that they got a metallic taste of how bad the country would have been if that bunch of backward Republicans got in.
But the cost of W.'s misbegotten wars and his mishandling of the economy overwhelmed Obama's first term. And Obama underwhelmed on traits everyone thought he'd excel at: negotiating, selling, charming, scaring, bully-pulpiting, mobilizing, dealing with Capitol Hill and, especially, communicating. It's taken the White House four years to develop a coherent message: Pay your bills.
Washington's mood is as gray as the weather, full of burning Republicans and yearning Democrats.
We're facing default. Again.
We're mired in partisan trash-talking. Still.
And despite the tragedy of the children riddled with bullets in Newtown, Conn., no one is expecting any consequential fixes to our absurdly lax gun laws.
Many top Democrats here feel distant from the White House. They like seeing him try to take it to the Republicans on money and, in the all-too-brief time he has left to get things done before he morphs into a lame duck, want him to follow through on guns and immigration, to say this is the right thing to do and this is what we got elected on and either get on board or get out of the way.
The president complained that even when he invites Republicans to a White House picnic and poses with their families, ''it doesn't prevent them from going onto the floor of the House and blasting me for being a big-spending Socialist.''
Steve Stockman, a Republican elected to the House from Texas, has barely started work, but he's already threatening to start impeachment proceedings against the president if he takes executive action on gun safety measures.
A Greek chorus of historians and pols have been urging the president to spend more time schmoozing with Republican and Democratic lawmakers, as other presidents like Jefferson, Lincoln and L.B.J. did to get their way.
But Obama still resists the idea that personal relationships can be pivotal, noting that his ''suspicion'' is that the issues will be resolved only if Americans ''push hard,'' vote recalcitrant lawmakers out and ''reward folks who are trying to find common ground.''
And it's true that Republicans have snubbed the president. John Boehner blew off Obama's invites for six state dinners and Mitch McConnell skipped all but one.
Unlike Chris Christie, Republicans here want to make sure that the president dances alone.

Judge Rejects Victim's Plea and Sentences Teenager to 18 Years in Shooting

BYLINE: By RUSS BUETTNER

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 20

LENGTH: 492 words

A Harlem woman who was shot in the stomach by a teenager aiming at rival gang members asked a judge on Tuesday to show leniency in his sentencing.
In a letter that was read in court by the teenager's lawyer, the victim said that while the shooting had put her and her neighbors ''at severe risk,'' she also believed the boy had ''the potential one day to be a valuable member of the community.'' 
The teenager, Troy Folk, who was 16 at the time of the shooting and turned 18 on Monday, was convicted by a jury last month of assault and criminal possession of a weapon in the shooting. He faced up to 25 years in prison.
Justice Edward J. McLaughlin of State Supreme Court in Manhattan rejected the argument from the victim as well as one from Mr. Folk's lawyer, who said the teenager deserved leniency because of his age. The judge issued a sentence of 18 years in prison.
''You made your choices,'' Justice McLaughlin said.
The victim was walking her 3-year-old son home from a Christmas party just before 5 p.m. on Dec. 11, 2011. The toddler had been frightened by a balloon that popped at the party, so she stopped to show him that the balloons in a shop window were not so scary.
As they stood on a crowded stretch of Frederick Douglass Boulevard, near 117th Street, a bullet whizzed by, missing the toddler's head by inches and striking his mother in the stomach.
While the shooting had put people ''at severe risk,'' she wrote, Mr. Folk was ''capable of developing and exercising better judgment.''
During the trial last month, Andrew Warshawer, an assistant district attorney, said Mr. Folk and an accomplice, Carl Flournoy, had picked up the gun at the St. Nicholas Houses, where they lived, and set out to taunt members of a rival gang. But they were outnumbered and ran, with the rival gang members in chase.
Mr. Folk turned and fired, Mr. Warshawer told jurors. Though Mr. Folk has maintained that it was Mr. Flournoy who fired the gun, the evidence at the trial included a recorded phone call from Rikers Island in which Mr. Folk said he could escape prosecution ''if the woman I shot'' did not testify before the grand jury.
On Tuesday, Mr. Warshawer told Justice McLaughlin that while Mr. Folk had never been convicted of a felony, a month before the shooting he had been involved, though not charged, in a coat robbery with Mr. Flournoy that ended with the victim shot in the neck.
Mr. Flournoy, now 16, pleaded guilty to weapons possession in the shooting of the woman and to robbery in the earlier case. He was sentenced to a total of 4 to 12 years in prison as a juvenile offender.
Justice McLaughlin said Mr. Folk had expressed no remorse and continued to blame Mr. Flournoy. The judge, who presides over many gang and gun-violence cases, said that being in a gang and getting a gun ''doesn't come with the ability to accurately use the thing.''
Mr. Folk declined to speak at the hearing, but as the judge announced the sentence, he smiled broadly.

Obama Proposal To Look Beyond Mass Shootings

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER, MICHAEL LUO and MICHAEL D. SHEAR; Michael Cooper and Michael Luo reported from New York, and Michael D. Shear from Washington. Ray Rivera contributed reporting from New York, Dan Frosch from Denver and Kirk Johnson from Seattle.

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 1204 words

A new federal assault weapons ban and background checks of all gun buyers, which President Obama is expected to propose on Wednesday, might have done little to prevent the massacre in Newtown, Conn., last month. The semiautomatic rifle that Adam Lanza used to shoot 20 schoolchildren and 6 adults complied with Connecticut's assault weapons ban, the police said, and he did not buy the gun himself.
But another proposal that Mr. Obama is expected to make could well have slowed Mr. Lanza's rampage: banning high-capacity magazines, like the 30-round magazines that the police said Mr. Lanza used, which have been factors in several other recent mass shootings.
Those shootings, whose victims have included a member of Congress in Arizona, moviegoers in Colorado and first graders in Connecticut, have horrified the country and inspired Washington to embark on the most extensive re-examination of the nation's gun laws in a generation. But some of the proposals that Mr. Obama is expected to make at the White House on Wednesday, which are likely to include a call for expanded background checks, a ban on assault weapons and limits on high-capacity clips, will be intended not only to prevent high-profile mass shootings, but also to curb the more commonplace gun violence that claims many thousands more lives every year. 
''The president has made clear that he intends to take a comprehensive approach,'' Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, said Tuesday. Mr. Carney said the proposals were aimed, broadly, at what he called ''the scourge of gun violence in this country.''
While semiautomatic rifles were used in several recent mass shootings, including those in Newtown and in Aurora, Colo., where 12 people were killed at a movie theater in July, a vast majority of gun murders in the United States are committed with handguns.
In 2011, 6,220 people were killed by handguns, and 323 by rifles, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. So while the administration is expected to try to restrict some types of assault weapons, it is also focusing on ways to keep more commonly used firearms out of the hands of dangerous criminals and people with mental illness.
Of course, the administration must keep political realities in mind as it drafts its proposals: getting any new gun regulations through Congress, particularly through the Republican-controlled House, is seen as difficult. So the White House must not only weigh the effectiveness of its proposals, but also their political feasibility.
The top priority of many gun control groups is to expand the background checks so that they apply to all buyers. All federally licensed firearms dealers are required to run background checks through the computerized databases that comprise the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. But the requirement does not cover guns that are sold by unlicensed sellers at gun shows and in other private sales, which account for about 40 percent of gun purchases in the country.
Better background checks would have had little effect on several recent mass shootings -- both Mr. Lanza, in Connecticut, and Jacob T. Roberts, who opened fire on a mall full of Christmas shoppers a few days earlier in Clackamas, Ore., were using weapons that they did not buy. But gun control groups say that expanded background checks would help keep guns out of the hands of dangerous criminals and people with mental illness, and would go a long way toward increasing public safety and could help prevent mass shootings.
Gun control groups have encouraged the administration to look beyond mass shootings. When the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, a leading gun control group, issued its recommendations to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who has been developing the administration's proposals, it urged him to develop ideas that could help curb everyday gun violence as well.
''Every death is a tragedy, whether in a mass shooting that horrifies our entire nation, or one of the 32 gun murders or 90 gun deaths in our communities and homes every day,'' it wrote.
With many of the proposals in Washington expected to be somewhat limited in scope, some public health researchers and gun control advocates said it was difficult to know what impact the recommendations might have.
''To have a huge, huge effect, we're going to need a sea change in not just the laws but social norms,'' David Hemenway, the director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center.
American civilians have 250 million to 300 million firearms, said Dr. Garen J. Wintemute, the director of the Violence Prevention Research Program at the University of California, Davis. ''Those firearms are not going to go away anytime soon,'' he said.
More serious steps -- like those taken by Australia, which reacted to a 1996 mass shooting by banning the sale, importation and possession of semiautomatic rifles and by removing 700,000 guns from circulation -- are seen as politically untenable. In the 18 years before the new gun laws, there were 13 mass shootings in Australia, and in the decade afterward, there were none, according to a 2006 article in Injury Prevention, a journal.
But expanding background checks in the United States would help disrupt criminal gun markets, a crucial driver of urban gun violence, Dr. Wintemute said. While there has been a debate over how effective background checks have been, Dr. Wintemute pointed to studies of prisoners incarcerated for crimes involving firearms that have found that at least 80 percent of them obtained their guns through private transfers.
''If we eliminate those, I think it's completely reasonable to expect a substantial drop in crimes related to firearms,'' he said.
When a two-day meeting on reducing gun violence wrapped up at Johns Hopkins University on Tuesday afternoon, researchers made some suggestions that have been the subject of relatively little public discussion in Washington.
They called, for example, for expanding the categories of people who are prohibited from buying firearms to include those who have committed violent misdemeanors. And they called for banning not just the sale of high-capacity magazines, but their possession as well.
Other measures being discussed in Washington include strengthening federal laws to combat gun trafficking. Gun control advocates argued that other steps were needed as well, like limiting the number of guns that can be bought by an individual every month.
''If you want to dam the river, you have to address all the channels,'' said Josh Horwitz, the executive director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. ''You're not going to stop it until you dam the whole river.''
Some people who met with Mr. Biden as he developed his recommendations said that they hoped the final proposals would address gun violence in its many forms.
''I think there was a recognition that we're not going to stop every mass shooting or gun homicide,'' said Hildy Saizow, the president of Arizonans for Gun Safety, who met with Mr. Biden last week.
''But we can go a long way to take action that would result in fewer gun deaths, fewer gun injuries. This is not just a narrow perspective that the task force is addressing, not just mass shootings or school shootings.''

Italy Closes Consulate in Benghazi After New Attack

BYLINE: By ELISABETTA POVOLEDO

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 3

LENGTH: 367 words

ROME -- Italy closed its consulate in Benghazi, Libya, and withdrew its staff because of security concerns, after an attempted ambush of the Italian consul over the weekend.
Though the diplomat, Guido De Sanctis, escaped unharmed, the episode raised concerns about the tenuous security situation in Libya as the transitional government struggles to rebuild the country after the overthrow of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi nearly two years ago. 
The Italian Foreign Ministry said the attack was an attempt to disrupt the Libyan government's efforts, ''further proof of the international community's need to intensify support for the Libyan people and institutions.''
In the ambush on Saturday, gunmen fired on Mr. De Sanctis as he drove through Benghazi, but none of the bullets penetrated his vehicle, an armored model that was issued to him after the Sept. 11 assault on the American mission in Benghazi, in which Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans were killed.
Officials in Tripoli pledged to bring those responsible for Saturday's attack to justice, the Italian government said. But the Libyan government has done little or nothing to pursue those who assaulted the American Mission, and there have been attacks on the Red Cross and on a British envoy's motorcade in Benghazi over the past year.
The Associated Press reported Monday that the government intended to create a security force to protect embassies and consulates that would include former rebels who now serve in the national police.
Italy, which ruled Libya as a colony until World War II, is the country's closest European ally. Commercial relations were strong during Colonel Qaddafi's rule, a state of affairs that Italian diplomats and business leaders have sought to preserve. The president of Libya, Mohamed Magariaf, traveled to Rome last week for talks with Italian political and businesses leaders, and the prime minister, Ali Zeidan, is scheduled to visit Italy at the end of this month.
At a meeting in Rome last Thursday, Mr. Magariaf assured his hosts that security was among his government's ''top concerns.'' He said his government was receiving Italian assistance to train Libyan soldiers and police officers.

Legislature Restricts Access to Permit Data

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 15

LENGTH: 776 words

New York State's new gun law seeks to restrict ownership of certain weapons. But it also restricts something else: access to previously public information about gun permits.
The new law, passed on Tuesday, requires that, for the next 120 days, no information about gun permit holders in a new statewide gun registration database is made available publicly, according to Robert Freeman, the executive director of the State Committee on Open Government. After that, gun permit holders will have the right to have their names and addresses removed from the database by contacting their local county clerks or police departments.
Legislators rushed to include this protection in its gun regulation proposal after the suburban newspaper The Journal News published on Dec. 23 the names and addresses of gun permit holders in Westchester and Rockland Counties, and put online a map showing the locations of the gun permit holders. 
The article and map prompted outrage from gun owners, who said they felt they could be harassed or have their homes broken into. Employees of The Journal News received so many threatening phone calls and e-mails that the publisher hired armed guards to protect the staff. A local gun group organized its members to contact advertisers, pressuring them to pull advertising from the paper.
Janet Hasson, The Journal News's president and publisher, said in a statement about the new law: ''We are disappointed with the broad nature of several exemptions in the law and lack of opportunity for any reasonable period for public comment or discussion. We are reviewing the law and the impact it might have on publication of permit data in the future.''
Mr. Freeman added that the newspaper could still publish the data. The Journal News obtained the information legally through Freedom of Information Act requests, and it is already in the public domain.
''It's up online,'' Mr. Freeman said. ''The information is in cyberspace.''
New data from the state will be available, but will not include information from gun owners who request to be excluded. New York joins other states that have made gun information less accessible in recent years. Fewer than a dozen states continue to make some data about permit holders available, according to Laura Cutilletta, senior staff attorney with the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which was started in San Francisco after a 1993 workplace shooting. Many of those remaining states have caveats, like Arkansas, which limits the data to the name and ZIP code of an applicant when they are requested by an Arkansas resident, Ms. Cutilletta added.
Many journalists had predicted shortly after The Journal News published its data that legislators would call for an end to public disclosure of the information in New York. Matt Waite, a professor at the College of Journalism and Mass Communications at the University of Nebraska, noted that Florida, which he described as the ''Shangri-La of public records,'' shut down access to gun data shortly after an Orlando television station published a database of people with concealed-weapons licenses in 2005. A similar response occurred in Virginia, after The Roanoke Times published data in 2007.
Professor Waite lamented the many types of journalism that reporters would be unable to practice when information of this kind is no longer available publicly. ''We no longer know if people who are qualified or mentally ill or felons are getting firearms' licenses,'' he said. ''We have no way of independently verifying whether the government is doing their job.''
The Journal News article and map spurred disagreement even among journalists, many of whom argued that the reporter, Dwight R. Worley, could have chosen a more effective way to publish the data without singling out individuals. But Mr. Worley said he was committed to publishing it.
''There is no additional need for analysis and pairing with other databases,'' said Mr. Worley, adding that simply informing people about who owns guns in the community was enough.
The swift shutdown of access to gun data has led to a discussion among journalists about how to approach the publication of contentious data in the future. Mark Horvit, the executive director of Investigative Reporters and Editors, a nonprofit organization, stressed how important it could be to publish such information with context, especially something as controversial as gun data.
''Any time that a news organization does something with data that causes controversy, it creates the risk that lawmakers will seize the opportunity to make information that should be public private,'' Mr. Horvit said. ''This is a cycle that gets repeated.''

Skirmishes Threaten Pakistan-India Thaw

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 10

LENGTH: 418 words

NEW DELHI -- Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India on Tuesday made what may be one of his most aggressive public statements ever about Pakistan, saying that renewed hostilities between the countries in the disputed Kashmir region had made a continued thaw in relations impossible. 
Hours later, Pakistan accused the Indian military of an unprovoked attack, saying it had shot across the contested Line of Control border the countries share and killed a Pakistani soldier, bringing the total death toll in the skirmishes to five over the past week.
India and Pakistan had maintained a cease-fire since November 2003, and relations had been improving over the past year. But on Jan. 6, Pakistan accused the Indian Army of crossing the Line of Control and killing one Pakistani soldier and wounding another. India denied these accusations, and two days later accused Pakistan of killing two Indian soldiers at the line and of beheading one of them. Pakistan denied these charges.
Responding to the attack and beheading, Mr. Singh told the local television station NDTV on Tuesday that, ''after this dastardly act, there can't be business as usual with Pakistan.'' India's external affairs minister, Salman Khurshid, echoed the prime minister's words in a statement issued later Tuesday.
''It should not be felt that the brazen denial and the lack of a proper response from the government of Pakistan to our repeated demarches on this incident will be ignored and that bilateral relations could be unaffected or that there will be business as usual,'' Mr. Khurshid said. Calling the Pakistani Army's purported actions ''in contravention of all norms of international conduct,'' and a ''grave provocation,'' Mr. Khurshid said they shed doubts on Pakistan's seriousness about normalizing relations with India.
On Monday, Gen. Bikram Singh, the chief of the Indian Army, warned that India could retaliate. ''If provoked, we will retaliate,'' he told reporters in New Delhi. ''We reserve the right to retaliate at a time of our choosing.'' However, there was no immediate comment from the Indian military about the Pakistani claim that it had resumed shooting on Tuesday.
Serious military action between the two nations, which have nuclear weapons, seems unlikely, analysts in India said in recent days. Still, civilians may already be feeling an impact. On Tuesday, India was supposed to start a ''visa on arrival'' program for older residents of Pakistan. Instead, that program was stalled, The Press Trust of India reported.

Gunman Kills 2 at College in Eastern Kentucky

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- A gunman firing into a vehicle killed two people and wounded a teenager on Tuesday as they sat in the parking lot of an eastern Kentucky community college. 
The campus was locked down for more than an hour while the police searched the two buildings of Hazard Community and Technical College in Hazard, the police told a news conference broadcast live on WYMT-TV's Web site. The college's president, Stephen Greiner, said that at the time of the shooting, about 30 students were on campus, 90 miles southeast of Lexington, Ky.
The police recovered a semiautomatic pistol at the scene, and a man who walked into an office of the Kentucky State Police in Hazard and said he knew something about the shooting was being questioned as a suspect, Chief Minor Allen of the Hazard Police Department said.
A man and a woman were dead when the police arrived about 6 p.m., Chief Allen said. The teenager, a female, was taken to University of Kentucky Hospital, he said. He said a domestic dispute may have led to the shooting.
Wednesday's classes were called off.

Kings Have Stability and Tight Schedule on Their Side in Bid to Repeat

BYLINE: By KAREN CROUSE

SECTION: Section B; Column 0; Sports Desk; Pg. 15

LENGTH: 907 words

EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- On the second day of the N.H.L.'s truncated training camps, six news vans and satellite trucks parked in the lot of the training center shared by the Los Angeles Kings and the Los Angeles Lakers.
The defending Stanley Cup champion Kings finished their Monday morning practice outside the glare of the television cameras. Their injured center Anze Kopitar, who produced 20 points in 20 playoff games, tested his sprained right knee for the first time during a 30-minute skate in front of two team employees and a handful of print and online journalists clicking away on their smartphone cameras. 
The television cameras flocked to the practice court of the Lakers, whose injured center, Dwight Howard, had returned to the lineup the night before and produced 22 points in 29 minutes for the last N.B.A. team to record its first victory of the new calendar year.
Welcome to Los Angeles, where dysfunction rules even as the Kings, after a seven-month hiatus, finally are able to begin their reign. Their campaign to become the first team since Detroit in 1998 to win back-to-back Stanley Cup championships starts Saturday with a home game against the Chicago Blackhawks. Before the puck drops, the players will receive their championship rings and the fans will get replicas of the title banner that will be raised to the rafters during a ceremony that had to wait for three months because of the lockout.
The Kings were one of the feel-good stories of 2012, but that was then. The new season, said the team's president and general manager, Dean Lombardi, ''is not about recapturing that feeling, it's about writing a new story.''
The roster that compiled a 16-4 record in the postseason returns intact, no small advantage in a lockout-shortened 48-game season. The Kings on Sunday added forward Anthony Stewart, a former first-round draft pick of the Florida Panthers whom they acquired in a trade that sent Kevin Westgarth, who was not on their playoff roster, to the Carolina Hurricanes.
''It's an advantage if we're healthy, but unfortunately, we're not,'' said Kings Coach Darryl Sutter, who begins his first full season, such as it is, at the helm of the team after replacing Terry Murray, who was fired last December.
He added, ''When we won the championship last year, if you look at the lineup we fielded from the middle of January on, it was pretty much intact.''
In addition to Kopitar, who was injured while playing in Sweden during the lockout, the veteran defenseman Willie Mitchell has been kept off the ice while rehabilitating from off-season knee surgery.
One player Sutter is not worried about is his star goaltender, Jonathan Quick, who had back surgery in August. Quick's physician, Dr. Robert Watkins, also operated on the Howard in April.
Quick was bothered all spring by a herniated disk that pinched his sciatic nerve. Playing through the discomfort, Quick posted a 1.41 goals-against average and .946 save percentage in the postseason on his way to earning the Conn Smythe Trophy.
If the season had started on time, Quick would not have been cleared to play. The condensed schedule, with its average of 3.44 games a week, sets up well for Quick and the Kings, who dominated the postseason after squeaking into the playoffs in the eighth and final spot. On the way to becoming the first eighth seed in the N.H.L. to win the Stanley Cup, they went unbeaten on the road and dispatched the first, second and third seeds.
''The tempo, the speed, the urgency of every game, it's going to feel like the playoffs all over again,'' Quick said.
Quick, who turns 27 two days after the season opener, was one of 10 Connecticut-born players in the N.H.L. last season. There have been only 28 in the league's history, and he was proud to parade the Stanley Cup in front of nearly 200 of his friends and neighbors during an August weekend-long celebration in his hometown, Hamden.
The mood was much more somber when he returned in December, for a weekend visit, during a break in his training with the Kings' minor league team in Manchester, N.H. Accompanied by his pregnant wife, Jaclyn, and their toddler daughter, Madison, Quick started on the three-and-half-hour drive.
On the radio, they heard a news bulletin about a shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., about 30 miles west of Hamden. Over the next couple of hours, they learned more about the massacre of 20 first graders and 6 school staff members at Sandy Hook Elementary.
''As you get closer and closer to Connecticut and driving through Connecticut, every radio station's covering it,'' Quick said. ''My daughter's sleeping in the back, and I look over and my wife, who's due in April, is crying. I just had to turn the radio off.''
Quick said he will hold Newtown in his heart this season.
''There's no words you can say that mean anything, you know?'' Quick said. ''At the end of the day, no matter what you do or say, it's not going to give any justice to what took place.''
Later on Monday, Quick and his teammates traveled across town to Staples Center for a practice attended by more than 6,000 fans and televised on a sports cable network. The 119-day lockout was but a blink for a franchise that waited 45 years to celebrate its first Stanley Cup.
It matters little to the Kings that they are entering uncharted territory, or that they have had to wait so long to raise their championship banner. Their theme for this season is ''The Journey Continues.''

In Debate Over Curbing Gun Violence, Even Language Can Be Loaded

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 14

LENGTH: 953 words

WASHINGTON -- When the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence wanted to promote more restrictions on firearms after the Connecticut school shootings in December, it turned to a firm to help publicize its position. The firm's name? Point Blank Public Affairs.
When Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. promised ideas for responding to the massacre, he said he was ''shooting for Tuesday'' -- even as he warned that there is ''no silver bullet'' for stopping gun violence. When President Obama noted that he was reviewing those ideas, he said on a different topic that he would not negotiate ''with a gun at the head.'' 
No wonder it is hard to get rid of gun violence when Washington cannot even get rid of gun vocabulary. The vernacular of guns suffuses the political and media conversation in ways that politicians and journalists are often not even conscious of, underscoring the historical power of guns in the American experience. Candidates ''target'' their opponents, lawmakers ''stick to their guns,'' advocacy groups ''take aim'' at hostile legislation and reporters write about a White House ''under fire.''
The ubiquitous nature of such language has caused people on both sides of the emotional debate in recent weeks to take back, or at least think twice about the phrases they use, lest they inadvertently cause offense in a moment of heightened sensitivity.
''It's almost second nature,'' said Andrew Arulanandam, director of public affairs for the National Rifle Association. ''They're such mainstream phrases, you almost have to check yourself and double-check yourself.''
But it also says something about the long American romance with guns and the nation's self image. ''All of that ties into the frontier tradition, rugged individualism, a single American with a flintlock or a gun of some kind holding off the Indians or fighting off the British,'' said Robert Spitzer, a scholar of gun control at the State University of New York at Cortland.
While Mr. Spitzer called that more mythology than reality, even he found himself using such references in a recent speech responding to comments by Wayne LaPierre, the N.R.A.'s vice president, after the Sandy Hook Elementary School attack. ''My opening line was, his speech was a misfire; he missed the target,'' Mr. Spitzer recalled. ''I liked using the gun metaphor because I think it's doubly appropriate for him.''
In that case, of course, he was doing it deliberately. And others use double entendre purposefully. The National Shooting Sports Foundation says on its Web site that it is ''always shooting for more'' to promote the future of sport shooting. For an editorial last week criticizing Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, for his past solidarity with the N.R.A., The New York Times used the headline, ''Senator Reid Takes Fresh Aim.''
But much of the time, such phrases come spilling out without apparent irony. Candy Crowley, the CNN anchor, introduced an interview by highlighting ''our conversation with N.R.A. point man Asa Hutchinson.'' Christiane Amanpour on the same network featured a story about a Tennessee lawmaker known for supporting gun rights. ''So why did the N.R.A. take aim at her?'' she asked.
After Alex Jones, a gun rights advocate, erupted during an interview with Piers Morgan, the Internet lit up. As of Tuesday, the phrase ''Alex Jones goes ballistic'' drew 357,000 hits on Google.
The Brady Campaign found itself in the awkward position of using a firm called Point Blank when it needed help last month. Point Blank, named for the Bruce Springsteen song, had an archery bull's-eye on its Web site. But it has since dissolved and one of its principals, Debra DeShong Reed, has founded a new firm, called Five by Five Public Affairs, that is now working for the Brady Campaign.
The Brady Campaign's own name attests to the sensitivity of language in the gun debate. Gun control advocates these days generally do not use the term gun control; instead, they talk about curbing gun violence, recognizing that ''control'' stirs opposition among legal gun owners who fear their rights being trampled.
The use of gun symbolism has at times provoked controversy. After Representative Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona was shot in the head by a gunman in 2011, many criticized Sarah Palin, the former vice-presidential nominee, for using cross hairs on her Web site to identify Democrats like Ms. Giffords who she said should be defeated for re-election.
Gun control advocates like Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden tend to draw less criticism when they use the language of guns. ''We know that there is no silver bullet,'' Mr. Biden said last week about stemming gun violence. But he said he planned to present an array of ideas to Mr. Obama that he hoped would make a difference. ''I'm shooting for Tuesday,'' he said.
At a news conference on Monday, Mr. Obama said he would review those ideas. But during a discussion on fiscal talks, he too used the terminology of firearms. ''What I will not do is have that negotiation with a gun at the head of the American people,'' he said.
Gun control advocates said such lapses are not surprising. ''We do it, too,'' said Mark Glaze, director of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, an advocacy group co-founded by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York. ''We notice and laugh, and we don't think it goes to our core motivations. We kind of accept that there's a piece of us that will always be based in the Old West.''
Mr. Glaze said he had slipped plenty of times. ''I stopped feeling guilty about it a while ago when one of the survivors we work with somehow managed to squeeze in at least four gun references into a sentence that had nothing to do with guns,'' he said. ''Since then, I've let it go.''

Warning Signs Of Violent Acts Often Unclear

BYLINE: By BENEDICT CAREY and ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 1065 words

No one but a deeply disturbed individual marches into an elementary school or a movie theater and guns down random, innocent people.
That hard fact drives the public longing for a mental health system that produces clear warning signals and can somehow stop the violence. And it is now fueling a surge in legislative activity, in Washington and New York.
But these proposed changes and others like them may backfire and only reveal how broken the system is, experts said. 
''Anytime you have one of these tragic cases like Newtown, it's going to expose deficiencies in the mental health system, and provide some opportunity for reform,'' said Richard J. Bonnie, a professor of public policy at the University of Virginia's law school who led a state commission that overhauled policies after the 2007 Virginia Tech shootings that left 33 people dead. ''But you have to be very careful not to overreact.''
New York State legislators on Tuesday passed a gun bill that would require therapists to report to the authorities any client thought to be ''likely to engage in'' violent behavior; under the law, the police would confiscate any weapons the person had.
And in Washington, lawmakers said that President Obama was considering a range of actions as part of a plan to reduce gun violence, including more sharing of records between mental health and law enforcement agencies.
The White House plan to make use of mental health data was still taking shape late Tuesday. But several ideas being discussed -- including the reporting provision in the New York gun law -- are deeply contentious and transcend political differences.
Some advocates favored the reporting provision as having the potential to prevent a massacre. Among them was D. J. Jaffe, founder of the Mental Illness Policy Org., which pushes for more aggressive treatment policies. Some mass killers ''were seen by mental health professionals who did not have to report their illness or that they were becoming dangerous and they went on to kill,'' he said.
Yet many patient advocates and therapists strongly disagreed, saying it would intrude into the doctor-patient relationship in a way that could dissuade troubled people from speaking their minds, and complicate the many judgment calls therapists already have to make.
The New York statute requires doctors and other mental health professionals to report any person who ''is likely to engage in conduct that would result in serious harm to self or others.''
Under current ethical guidelines, only involuntary hospitalizations (and direct threats made by patients) are reported to the authorities. These reports then appear on a federal background-check database. The new laws would go further.
''The way I read the new law, it means I have to report voluntary as well as involuntary hospitalizations, as well as many people being treated for suicidal thinking, for instance, as outpatients,'' said Dr. Paul S. Appelbaum, director of the Division of Law, Ethics, and Psychiatry at Columbia University's medical school. ''That is a much larger group of people than before, and most of whom will never be a serious threat to anyone.''
One fundamental problem with looking for ''warning signs'' is that it is more art than science. People with serious mental disorders, while more likely to commit aggressive acts than the average person, account for only about 4 percent of violent crimes over all.
The rate is higher when it comes to rampage or serial killings, closer to 20 percent, according to Dr. Michael Stone, a New York forensic psychiatrist who has a database of about 200 mass and serial killers. He has concluded from the records that about 40 were likely to have had paranoid schizophrenia or severe depression or were psychopathic, meaning they were impulsive and remorseless.
''But most mass murders are done by working-class men who've been jilted, fired, or otherwise humiliated -- and who then undergo a crisis of rage and get out one of the 300 million guns in our country and do their thing,'' Dr. Stone said.
The sort of young, troubled males who seem to psychiatrists most likely to commit school shootings -- identified because they have made credible threats -- often do not qualify for any diagnosis, experts said. They might have elements of paranoia, of deep resentment, or of narcissism, a grandiose self-regard, that are noticeable but do not add up to any specific ''disorder'' according to strict criteria.
''The really scary ones, you have a gut feeling right away when you talk to them,'' said Dr. Deborah Weisbrot, director of the outpatient clinic of child and adolescent psychiatry at Stony Brook University, who has interviewed about 200 young people, mostly teenage boys, who have made threats. ''What they have in common is a kind of magical thinking, odd beliefs like they can read other people's minds, or see the future, or that things happening in their dreams come true.''
Even if such instincts could be relied on, the mental health system is so fragmented in the country that it is hard to know whether the information would get to the right person in time. According to Dr. Bonnie, the Virginia law professor, the Virginia Tech gunman was ordered to outpatient treatment by a judge more than a year before his rampage but was never hospitalized, which would have shown up on a background check.
The state database now includes such cases, after the reforms. ''But we're a state that has a centralized database like that; in many states there's no one place to get it all; it's all kept locally, community by community,'' Dr. Bonnie said.
The federal background check database, which is supposed to have updated information from states, has only a patchwork, because of the wide variety of state laws on reporting, experts said. Even if it were entirely up to date, it would not catch the many millions who never see a mental health professional despite deep distress.
Some experts, like Dr. Appelbaum, say the Connecticut school shooting offers the kind of opportunity that only comes once every generation or two: to rethink the entire mental health system. It might include appointing a presidential commission; re-envisioning community mental health care; focusing more on vigilance for problems in young people, and reducing stigma.
''It seems to me an opportunity to step back and rethink what the entire system should look like,'' Dr. Appelbaum said.

Israeli Soldiers Kill Palestinian at Barrier

BYLINE: By ISABEL KERSHNER

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 10

LENGTH: 661 words

JERUSALEM -- Israeli forces fatally shot a Palestinian teenager during a confrontation along the West Bank barrier on Tuesday, underscoring the potential for spiraling violence after weeks of simmering unrest in the area.
Two more Palestinians, both men in their early 20s, were fatally shot in recent days along Gaza's border with Israel, one of them in disputed circumstances. The use of live ammunition against unarmed protesters in the West Bank has become less common after years of relative stability.
But disturbances have increased across the West Bank since mid-November, when Israel embarked on a fierce eight-day military campaign against the rocket-launching infrastructure in the Gaza Strip, controlled by the militant group Hamas. The rising tensions also come after years of stagnation in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and against the background of a dire financial crisis that has prevented the Palestinian Authority, the interim self-rule body in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, from paying tens of thousands of government workers their full salaries on time. 
With Israeli commentators speculating about the prospect of a third Palestinian intifada, or uprising, the military says it has been acting with restraint in order to avoid escalating tensions further.
The teenager killed on Tuesday was identified as Samir Ahmad Awwad, 16, from the village of Budrus, in the Ramallah district of the West Bank. Muhammad Marar, the head of the village council, told the Palestinian independent news agency Maan that a group of students leaving the village high school after an examination threw stones at Israeli soldiers gathered nearby and that the soldiers responded with live fire.
A spokesman for the Israeli military said that several Palestinians had approached the security fence and damaged it in an attempt to cross. He added that soldiers at the scene ''responded in order to prevent an infiltration'' and that live fire was used.
Citing witnesses, Palestinian activists said that Mr. Awwad was walking away from light clashes that had erupted by the barrier when he was hit from behind by three bullets in his leg, head and torso. The activists distributed photographs of the boy's corpse.
Budrus lies adjacent to the barrier, a system of fences, walls, razor wire and patrol roads that Israel has built over the last decade with the stated purpose of keeping Palestinian suicide bombers out of Israeli cities. However, much of it cuts through West Bank territory and Budrus became an early symbol of Palestinian popular resistance against the barrier. Activists held regular protests as it was being built and caused the Israeli planners to reroute it so as to take in less of the village land.
In another sign of growing unrest, the Palestinian news media reported this week that gunmen affiliated with the mainstream Fatah party led by the president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, had been marching with weapons in some West Bank refugee camps in recent days, calling on the authority to return weapons it confiscated under a security campaign more than a year ago and demanding to be employed as public servants.
On Friday, Israeli forces shot to death a Palestinian man and wounded another near the fence separating Gaza and Israel. Witnesses said that a group of Palestinians had approached the fence, which Israel forbids on security grounds. Israeli military officials said soldiers had acted in accordance with the rules of engagement and fired at the legs of protesters who were trying to damage the fence.
A Palestinian farmer died hours after being shot near the Gaza border on Monday, but the Israeli military denied any involvement in that episode.
Underlining Israel's security concerns along its border with Gaza, the Israeli military said on Tuesday that its soldiers had discovered the shaft of a tunnel leading from Gaza into Israeli territory and that it had been constructed for the purpose of attacking Israelis.

Candidates Diverge On Residency For Police

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN; Wendy Ruderman contributed reporting.

LENGTH: 477 words

Should New York City police officers be required to live in New York City?
That was the question posed Tuesday night by the Rev. Al Sharpton to a panel of five Democratic mayoral hopefuls, and the five, caught a bit off-guard, offered divergent answers. 
At present, many police officers live on Long Island, or in the counties of Westchester, Rockland and Putnam. But the idea of changing the rules -- with a grandfather clause for officers now living beyond the city limits -- has been occasionally kicked around.
The issue has not been a focus during previous mayoral panels, so Mr. Sharpton decided to ask the five candidates for a simple yes-or-no answer, during a rousing hour-and-a-half debate at his National Action Network headquarters in Harlem.
Two candidates said yes to the requirement: Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, and John C. Liu, the comptroller. One candidate said no: Bill de Blasio, the public advocate.
The other two were less clear. William C. Thompson Jr., a former comptroller who lost to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg in 2009, suggested that he agreed in theory, but he noted that the cost of living in the city was steep. That sentiment was echoed by Sal Albanese, a councilman from the 1990s who just entered the race.
The question was part of a broader discussion about race, the stop-and-frisk practice, and social justice that frequently elicited applause -- and occasional boos -- from the crowd. The evening often seemed like a referendum on the policies of Mr. Bloomberg, who talked to the audience about gun control and got a warm reception.
Perhaps the most charged moments were when Mr. Sharpton asked the candidates whether they would keep Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly.
Ms. Quinn, who, according to recent news accounts, had said she would keep him on, said, ''I have no jobs to offer to him or anyone else.'' But when she said that the city ''would be lucky'' if he stayed, the crowd booed, prompting her to say, ''Wait a minute! Wait a minute!'' She then added: ''If I'm mayor, the police commissioner will work for me and that includes a mandate to end unconstitutional stop, question and frisk.''
By contrast, Mr. Thompson received the biggest applause when he said flatly: ''I'm going to bring my own team. I'm not keeping other people's people.''
Mr. Sharpton ended the talk by asking the candidates to list the issue with which they most disagreed with the mayor.
Mr. de Blasio cited Mr. Bloomberg's decision to overturn term limits, in a dig at Ms. Quinn, who corralled the City Council votes to pass the law. Mr. Liu said the administration's lack of diversity at the top levels did not reflect New York, and offered his current rainbow cabinet as a contrast. Mr. Thompson mentioned education. Ms. Quinn, referring to legislation enacted by the City Council, mentioned economic inequality and homeless policy.

Sweeping Limits on Guns Become Law in New York

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 15

LENGTH: 647 words

ALBANY -- Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo signed into law a sweeping package of gun-control measures on Tuesday, significantly expanding a ban on assault weapons and making New York the first state to change its laws in response to the mass shooting at a Connecticut elementary school.
Mr. Cuomo signed the bill less than an hour after the State Assembly approved it by a 104-to-43 vote on the second full day of the 2013 legislative session. The State Senate, which had in the past resisted more restrictive gun laws, approved the measure 43 to 18 on Monday night. 
''I am proud to be part of this government, not just because New York has the first bill, but because New York has the best bill,'' the governor, a Democrat, said at a news conference. ''I'm proud to be a New Yorker because New York is doing something -- because we are fighting back.''
The expanded ban on assault weapons broadens the definition of what is considered an assault weapon and reduces the permissible size of gun magazines to 7 rounds, from 10. It also includes provisions to better keep firearms away from mentally ill people and to impose stiffer penalties on people who use guns in the commission of crimes.
Gun-rights advocates denounced the measure. The New York State Rifle and Pistol Association said New York gun owners ''should be ashamed and afraid of our state,'' and the National Rifle Association said, ''These gun-control schemes have failed in the past and will have no impact on public safety and crime.''
''The Legislature caved to the political demands of a governor and helped fuel his personal political aspirations,'' the N.R.A. said.
But Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York City, a vocal advocate of gun control, hailed the legislation, saying it ''protects the Second Amendment rights of people, and at the same time it makes all New Yorkers safer.''
''We have some of the toughest gun laws in the country, and this just strengthens them,'' Mr. Bloomberg said.
Elected officials in New York and around the nation have been debating how to respond to gun violence since the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. As the New York Legislature was voting for the new gun-control measures, the state's comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli, said that he would freeze investments by the state's pension fund in firearm manufacturers. The pension fund sold holdings in Smith & Wesson after the Newtown shooting; the fund continues to hold about $2 million worth of shares in Sturm, Ruger & Company.
Mr. Cuomo, saying that gun violence constituted an emergency requiring immediate action, waived a constitutionally required three-day waiting period between the introduction of legislation and a vote to allow speedy action on the gun-law package. But during the Assembly debate, which lasted nearly five hours, a number of Republicans criticized both the bill's content and the lack of public hearings or other public processes for considering the proposals.
''Why are we being bullied into voting on this bill without our proper, responsible due diligence?'' asked Assemblyman Steve Katz, a Hudson Valley Republican. ''Solely due to the governor's misguided, egotistic notion that this will advance his presidential aspirations.''
Assembly Democrats, who have pushed for new gun-control laws for years, hailed the legislation as long overdue.
''It's taken far too many deaths to get us to this point,'' said Assemblyman Thomas J. Abinanti, a Democrat from Westchester County. ''The Second Amendment does not guarantee the right to bear arms to kill innocent firefighters, teachers and children, and that's the message we have to send.''
The expanded ban on assault weapons takes effect immediately; New Yorkers who already own guns that are banned under the new law can keep them, but will have to register them with the state within a year. Other provisions of the bill take effect at later dates.

Walmart Plans to Buy American More Often

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

SECTION: Section B; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 919 words

The manufacturer 1888 Mills produces most of its sheets and towels overseas, in part to keep costs low for retailers like Walmart. But after Walmart gave 1888 Mills a long-term contract for towels made in the United States, 1888's chief executive said the company expected to produce more goods here.
A wide range of companies, including Apple, General Electric and Brooks Brothers, are experimenting with making more products in the United States. The moves make good public relations, but they also take advantage of cheaper energy costs and transportation benefits in this country. 
On Tuesday, Walmart, the nation's largest retailer, gave its suppliers an added incentive, announcing that it would increase sourcing of American-made products by $50 billion over the next 10 years. Walmart said it would buy more goods already produced in the United States, like games and paper, as well as help vendors in areas like furniture and textiles return production that had moved overseas.
The company did not disclose the value of the American-made products it already sourced. In its most recent fiscal year, Walmart spent $335 billion buying and transporting merchandise globally. (It does not break out figures for the United States and Sam's Club, which represent about 70 percent of over all sales.) The $50 billion commitment -- $5 billion a year -- represents about 1.5 percent of that annual total.
With rising labor and energy costs overseas, ''a few manufacturers have even told Walmart privately that they have defined the 'tipping points' at which manufacturing abroad will no longer make sense for them,'' William S. Simon, the Wal-Mart U.S. chief executive, said in making the announcement at the National Retail Federation conference in New York.
Walmart has been under pressure concerning its overseas sourcing because of a deadly fire in November in Bangladesh that killed more than 100 people at a factory used by Walmart suppliers. Walmart has said it did not know the suppliers were using the factory, and a Walmart spokesman, David Tovar, said on Tuesday that the company had been working on the new initiative to buy more American goods for more than a year.
James Cerruti, a senior partner for strategy and research at the consulting firm Brandlogic, said that while Walmart no doubt wanted to get away from recent negative news like the factory fire, gun sales and a Mexico bribery inquiry, ''these are real commitments.''
One beneficiary of the new effort, 1888 Mills, said an advantage was Walmart's committing to contracts longer than the standard six months to a year. Jonathan R. Simon, the 1888 chief executive, said Walmart had given the company a multiyear contract outlining how and when it would buy the American-made towels.
That ''allows us to make investments with confidence,'' he said. ''We've been staying with U.S. manufacturing and quite honestly, we're one of the very last producers of terry towels left in the United States. It had been quite a challenge, keeping the operation going, but we stuck with it hoping that eventually there would be more opportunity.''
Mr. Simon said 1888 Mills made about 10 percent of its products in the United States, including towels in Griffin, Ga. While 1888 Mills had been supplying Walmart with foreign-made products, the retailer recently agreed to carry an American-made towel at 600 of its stores starting this spring.
Executives at Walmart told Mr. Simon that ''especially in some of the towns where we manufacture that have been hit hard by the economic downturn, that these are Walmart customers and it makes perfect sense to try to support jobs here in the U.S. for people who end up shopping in their stores,'' he said.
In the last decade or so, American manufacturers have moved operations to China, Bangladesh, Vietnam and other lower-cost countries as they try to meet retailers' strict cost requirements. However, recent consumer interest in American-made goods, rising labor and energy costs overseas, and pressure to get merchandise from the design phase into stores within weeks rather than months have renewed interest in manufacturing in this country.
For instance, the United States turned out almost 100 million pairs of shoes in 2000, but that fell to about 26 million by 2009, according to the American Apparel and Footwear Association. In 2011, though, there was a rebound to 30 million pairs.
The association reported a similar trend in apparel, with about one-third of all apparel sold in the United States being produced in this country in 2000. By 2009 that amount had fallen to 2.1 percent, but ticked up to 2.3 percent in 2011.
Bill Kilbride, the president of Mohawk Home, a Walmart supplier that produced rugs and mats in the United States, said that although American-made products often cost more, Walmart seemed to find the speed with which domestic manufacturers could make and get items into stores compelling.
Even so, Kevin Burke, the chief executive of the American Apparel and Footwear Association, said the challenge for Walmart would be finding vendors who could meet its price points with American production, which was generally much more expensive than overseas production.
''The trend has been to be offshore,'' Mr. Burke said. Overseas production is ''indicative of consumer demand for product at a lower price.''
The 1888 Mills product made in the United States, for instance, would not be budget-priced, but would be ''more in the luxury end of the business,'' Mr. Simon, the 1888 Mills chief executive, said.

New York Leads on Gun Control

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; EDITORIAL; Pg. 22

LENGTH: 501 words

The broad gun control bill approved Tuesday by the New York Legislature substantially strengthens the state's gun control laws and, if vigorously enforced, could make New York one of the toughest places in the country to buy, sell or own dangerous weapons. But the bill also contains troubling provisions involving mental health and public access to important records that should be revisited and reworked. 
The bill was muscled through with disturbing speed after days of secret negotiations and a late-night vote Monday by state senators who had barely read the complicated measure before passing it. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who signed it into law on Tuesday, obviously calculated that it was necessary to move quickly before gun advocates could marshal serious opposition. Even so, Albany's customarily top-down and largely undemocratic legislative methods were inappropriate for such a complex bill.
The law has several strong provisions. It expands the current ban on assault weapons to include any semiautomatic weapon with a detachable magazine and one military-style feature (instead of two). It limits magazine clips to 7 rounds of ammunition instead of the current 10.
The law will require gun licenses to be renewed every five years; in some counties, a single license can last a lifetime. Background checks will be required at all gun sales, including most private ones, with an exception for immediate members of a gun-owner's family. There will be a new electronic database for gun permits, and a new registry for ammunition sales that will allow the authorities to track people who are buying cartridges in unusually high volumes.
Some sections of the law, however, were not fully vetted in the rush. One provision asks health care professionals -- physicians, psychologists, registered nurses or licensed clinical social workers -- to report to local health care officials when they have reason to believe that patients could harm themselves or others. Such a report, after wending its way through other bureaucratic layers, and after crosschecking against a database of gun owners, could eventually authorize police to confiscate firearms owned by a dangerous patient.
The provision would seem to raise significant legal questions. It is not clear who has the final authority to order the seizure, or at what point in the process the gun owner can appeal. The concept would also threaten established norms about doctor-patient relationships.
In addition, the law unwisely restricts public access to gun license records, an overreaction to a suburban newspaper's recent publication of names and addresses of licensees in Westchester and Rockland Counties. And the law requires safe storage of guns only if the house is being shared with a convicted criminal or someone else not authorized to have a gun license. Safe storage of guns should be a requirement for everyone.
Mr. Cuomo's law is an important and timely step toward sane gun control. But it needs a few fixes before it can become a national model.

An Oil Town Where Men Are Many, and Women Are Hounded

BYLINE: By JOHN ELIGON; Kevin Quealy contributed reporting.

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 1138 words

WILLISTON, N.D. -- Christina Knapp and a friend were drinking shots at a bar in a nearby town several weeks ago when a table of about five men called them over and made an offer.
They would pay the women $3,000 to strip naked and serve them beer at their house while they watched mixed martial arts fights on television. Ms. Knapp, 22, declined, but the men kept raising the offer, reaching $7,000.
''I said I make more money doing my job than degrading myself to do that,'' said Ms. Knapp, a tattoo artist with dark streaks in her light brown hair, a bird tattoo on her chest and piercings above her lip and left cheekbone.
The rich shale oil formation deep below the rolling pastures here has attracted droves of young men to work the labor-intensive jobs that get the wells flowing and often generate six-figure salaries. What the oil boom has not brought, however, are enough single women. 
At work, at housing camps and in bars and restaurants, men have been left to mingle with their own. High heels and skirts are as rare around here as veggie burgers. Some men liken the environment to the military or prison.
''It's bad, dude,'' said Jon Kenworthy, 22, who moved to Williston from Indiana in early December. ''I was talking to my buddy here. I told him I was going to import from Indiana because there's nothing here.''
This has complicated life for women in the region as well.
Many said they felt unsafe. Several said they could not even shop at the local Walmart without men following them through the store. Girls' night out usually becomes an exercise in fending off obnoxious, overzealous suitors who often flaunt their newfound wealth.
''So many people look at you like you're a piece of meat,'' said Megan Dye, 28, a nearly lifelong Williston resident. ''It's disgusting. It's gross.''
Prosecutors and the police note an increase in crimes against women, including domestic and sexual assaults. ''There are people arriving in North Dakota every day from other places around the country who do not respect the people or laws of North Dakota,'' said Ariston E. Johnson, the deputy state's attorney in neighboring McKenzie County, in an e-mail.
Over the past six years, North Dakota has shot from the middle of the pack to become the state with the third-highest ratio of single young men to single young women in the country. In 2011, nearly 58 percent of North Dakota's unmarried 18-to-34-year-olds were men, according to census data. That disparity was even starker in the three counties where the oil boom is heaviest -- there were more than 1.6 young single men for every young single woman.
And most people around here say the gap is considerably larger. Census data mostly captures permanent residents. Most of the men who come here to work maintain their primary residences elsewhere and split time between the oil fields and their homes. And women note that many of the men who approach them are married.
Some women have banked on the female shortage. Williston's two strip clubs attract dancers from around the country. Prostitutes from out of state troll the bars.
Natasha, 31, an escort and stripper from Las Vegas, is currently on her second stint here after hearing how much money strippers made in Williston on a CNN report last year. Business in her industry is much better here than in the rest of the country, she said. She makes at least $500 a night, but more often she exceeds $1,000.
''We make a lot of money because there's a lot of lonely guys,'' she said.
On a recent night at City Bar in nearby Watford City, the only women in the long, wood-paneled room were two bartenders and the woman running the karaoke. Under flashing lights, some of the male patrons huddled at the bar, while others played games like simulated buck shooting and darts.
Zach Mannon, 23, who has been working in the oil patch for three years, said he once bumped accidentally into a woman in a bar packed with men. He excused himself, he said, but then her boyfriend came over and accused him of grabbing her buttocks. He denied it. The man insisted they step outside, so they did, but 14 of Mr. Mannon's co-workers from his rig came along. The man backed down, they talked things over and no punches were thrown.
For Mr. Mannon, having women around was more about finding sanity than a soul mate.
''Out here, you can't tell a guy, like, 'I had a rough day,' '' Mr. Mannon said. ''They're going to go, 'Everyone has a rough day. Get over it, you sissy.'
''The bartender,'' he added, nodding toward the bar, ''she's the friendliest gal in the world. Every time I go in, she goes, 'How was your day, Zach?' I say, 'Ah, it was long; it was cold out.' She actually listens.''
But sensitivity is often absent here when men discuss women. Here, men talk of a ''Williston 10'' -- a woman who would be considered mediocre in any other city is considered a perfect 10 out here.
''I've noticed my standards dropping,'' said Ian Hernandez, 24, who moved to Williston from Chicago a couple of months ago. ''I just went home two weeks ago. I saw the girls I had planned to see. That, hopefully, should hold me off until I go back next time in two months or so.''
Some men have forced themselves on women.
Jessica Brightbill, a single 24-year-old who moved here from Grand Rapids, Mich., a year and a half ago, said she was walking to work at 3:30 in the afternoon when a car with two men suddenly pulled up behind her. One hopped out and grabbed her by her arms and began dragging her. She let her body go limp so she would be harder to drag. Eventually, a man in a truck pulled up and began yelling at the men and she got away, she said. The episode left her rattled.
Going out alone is now out of the question, and the friend she moved here with no longer has much time to spend with her because she has since found a boyfriend and had a baby. Ms. Brightbill said she has difficulty finding other young single women with the freedom to hang out. And, she said, finding good men does not come easy.
''It's just people trying to have sex,'' she said.
But some women have taken aggressive steps to protect themselves.
At the urging of her family, Barbara Coughlin, 31, who recently moved to Williston after her 11-year marriage ended, is now getting her concealed weapons permit so she can carry a Taser. Ms. Coughlin, who wore silver glitter around her eyes at work as a waitress on a recent day, said her mother and stepfather, who live here, advised her to stop wearing the skirts and heels she cherishes, so she does not stand out like ''a flower in the desert,'' as her stepfather put it. Her family hardly ever lets her go out on her own -- not even for walks down the gravel road at the housing camp where they live.
''Will I stay for very long? Probably not,'' she said. ''To me, there's no money in the world worth not even being able to take a walk.''

The Conversation About Guns

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; LETTERS; Pg. 22

LENGTH: 630 words

To the Editor:
When Joe Nocera asked his friend's daughter whether an assault weapon with 30-round magazines should be outlawed, she replied, ''That's the beginning of the slippery slope'' (''How to Shoot a Gun,'' column, Jan. 12). This common response is completely inadequate for at least two reasons.
First, reasonable regulations do not devolve into slippery slopes. Just because the government can set a speed limit of 65 miles per hour doesn't mean that it will then set it at 50, then 30, and pretty soon we won't have cars. We regulate all sorts of things without falling into abysses. 
Second, there is no explanation as to why any such slope doesn't run the other way. If I can have a semiautomatic gun with 30 rounds, why can't I have a fully automatic gun with 100 rounds or more? A stockpile of grenades? Shoulder-launched missiles? A radioactive ''dirty bomb''?
Not even the most ardent defenders of free speech support the right to falsely yell ''Fire!'' in a crowded theater. Gun rights advocates would similarly advance their cause by addressing proposed regulations on their own merits rather than reflexively relying on some fictitious ''slope.''
DANIEL A. SIMON New York, Jan. 13, 2013
To the Editor:
Re ''Revolutionary Language,'' by Charles Blow (column, Jan. 12):
Consider what has been said on behalf of weapons of war: Andrew Napolitano, a Fox News analyst, says the Second Amendment ''protects the right to shoot tyrants, and it protects the right to shoot at them effectively.'' He seemed to be talking about the Obama administration, or Congress. James Yeager, the chief executive of a Tennessee company that trains civilians to use weapons, says he'll start killing people if gun control efforts move forward, and he urges all ''patriots'' to do likewise.
Imagine what police departments and the F.B.I. would do if these statements were being made by Muslims in response to government harassment -- probably gear up to infiltrate and entrap Muslim groups and perhaps even launch murderous raids against them. That is precisely what happened when young Black Panthers brandished arms during the 1960s. Where were the advocates of the Second Amendment then?
Second Amendment enthusiasm has little to do with advocacy of constitutional rights, and everything to do with marketing for weapons manufacturers and with politically selective fears. Tell me if you're enthusiastic about Muslims arming themselves, or whether you were enthusiastic about the Black Panthers, and maybe I'll take your Second Amendment arguments seriously.

To the Editor:
Re ''Invasion of the Data Snatchers,'' by Bill Keller (column, Jan. 14), and ''Guns, Maps and Data That Disturb,'' by David Carr (The Media Equation column, Jan. 14):
Lost in the debate about the appropriateness of The Journal News' publishing an interactive map of handgun permits in Rockland and Westchester Counties is a defense of my parental right to protect my children from harm. Of 23 high-income countries, 87 percent of gun fatalities to children under 15 occur in the United States. Many studies link higher occurrences of gun fatalities to their presence in the home.
I know where the dangerous intersections near my home are and take precautions to protect my children there. Why shouldn't I be notified of the locations of potential danger spots for gun violence or accidents?
I expect my news sources to provide a public service in the form of information that can help keep me and those I love from harm. The Journal News has provided a public service; it's a shame that Mr. Keller and Mr. Carr deem that service merely inappropriately published data.

How Turkey Can Make Peace With the Kurds

BYLINE: By ALIZA MARCUS. 
Aliza Marcus is the author of ''Blood and Belief: The PKK and the Kurdish Fight for Independence.''

SECTION: Section ; Column 0; National Desk; OP-ED CONTRIBUTOR; Pg. 

LENGTH: 1060 words

WASHINGTON
THE assassination of three Kurdish activists in Paris last week has raised fears that the true target was peace talks between Turkey and the rebel Kurdistan Workers' Party, or the P.K.K. But the so-called peace process was already in shambles before the killings, which have not been solved.
Turkey's prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, claims that he wants a deal to end nearly 30 years of war between the state and the P.K.K. rebels. But he has yet to take the decisive action needed for a credible peace process. Until he understands that the Kurdish problem in Turkey is about politics and identity, and not just about getting the guerrillas to withdraw from Turkey and give up their weapons, there will be no hope for peace. 
The head of Turkish intelligence, Hakan Fidan, has recently been holding talks with the imprisoned P.K.K. leader, Abdullah Ocalan. Turkey's intelligence services have had discussions with Mr. Ocalan since he was captured in February 1999, but to no avail.
The problem is that Mr. Ocalan may not be the right partner to negotiate with. He is held in extreme isolation on an island prison, with all communication vetted by his jailers. He received a television in his cell for the first time just a few days ago. Visits must be approved, and rarely are. This means that Mr. Ocalan has limited knowledge of developments in the Kurdish region of Turkey. And while he remains the head of the P.K.K., he has no practical control over the rebels' day-to-day operations.
Even if he were in control, the highly authoritarian Mr. Ocalan is not necessarily the man to ensure democracy for Turkey's Kurds. During the nearly two decades he was based in Syria, Mr. Ocalan consolidated power by killing or isolating challengers.
A viable peace deal must answer Kurdish demands for human rights in a manner that protects the views of all Kurds, not just those of Mr. Ocalan and the P.K.K. And the best way to do this is through the Kurdish Peace and Democracy Party, known as the B.D.P., which won seats in Turkey's parliament in 2011 and can genuinely claim to represent Kurdish aspirations.
Mr. Erdogan needs to recognize that the way to peace is through politics. Instead of engaging solely with Mr. Ocalan, as if the P.K.K. rebellion were purely a security problem, he must craft a political process that addresses Kurds' grievances about cultural rights and autonomy, giving the rebels a reason to lay down their weapons.
To end the conflict, which has killed more than 40,000 people and hampered Turkey's ability to exert its clout in the Middle East, Turkey needs to do three things.
First, Mr. Erdogan must unequivocally commit to a negotiated process that includes compromises by both sides. While Turkey's territorial integrity should not be up for debate, everything else should be. Mr. Erdogan has generally been dismissive of Kurdish grievances. In a recent interview, he said there was no need to instruct Kurdish students in their native tongue, because they can already study the language as an elective. Instead of belittling Kurds' cultural demands, he should demonstrate good faith by pushing through stalled constitutional and legal reforms, including changes to constitutional provisions that restrict the use of the Kurdish language in schools, punish criticism of the Turkish state and define citizenship through the prism of Turkish identity.
Second, Mr. Erdogan needs to understand that disarming the P.K.K. won't come at the beginning of the peace process, but at the end. He can, and should, ask for a cease-fire agreement, but it cannot be a one-sided call for Kurdish surrender. To silence the P.K.K.'s guns while talks are under way, Turkey will also have to suspend its military operations against rebels in the southeast and in northern Iraq.
Third, Turkey shouldn't limit itself to negotiating with an imprisoned authoritarian figurehead; it should also negotiate with the B.D.P. Unlike the P.K.K., the B.D.P. has legal recognition. But it also has legitimacy among Kurds due to its close ties to the P.K.K.; its members share the P.K.K.'s political goals of Kurdish autonomy and recognize Mr. Ocalan as a leader of the Kurds. This is what makes the B.D.P. a serious negotiating partner; the party can be an effective conduit for P.K.K. demands and help devise a viable democratic reform package in Parliament.
Although the B.D.P. is dominated by its pro-P.K.K. members, the party is not an integral part of the rebel force. The B.D.P. has daily experience working in a democracy. It runs almost 100 municipalities; party leaders understand the give-and-take needed to govern effectively in a democracy. And the party contains other voices. They may feel beholden to the P.K.K., but they don't necessarily think the P.K.K. is always right.
Mr. Ocalan cannot be entirely excluded, because he is the leader of the most powerful Kurdish group inside Turkey and has the support of millions of Turkey's Kurds, who make up close to 20 percent of the population. He needs to be consulted and treated with respect, and his approval will be needed to prevent the possibility of a violent splinter group forming to oppose a peace agreement.
Unfortunately, instead of engaging the B.D.P., the Turkish government has been harassing many of its members. Over the past four years, around 8,000 Kurdish activists -- among them elected mayors, journalists and lawyers peacefully campaigning for greater cultural and political rights -- have been detained on charges, often trumped up, of working for the P.K.K. About 1,000 of them are facing trial. Turkey cannot demand that Kurds abandon violence and then imprison peaceful activists.
Turkey's government wants security and the preservation of its borders. The Kurds have replaced their demands for independence with the more practical goals of autonomy, native-language instruction in public schools, and an end to repression of Kurdish activism. They also want P.K.K. fighters to be able to return home from their mountain bases in northern Iraq and to freely engage in democratic politics.
Negotiating all of these issues is not beyond Mr. Erdogan's abilities. Having reduced the military's influence over civilian politics, he has shown that he isn't afraid of a fight. The same courage could help him steer his country toward a peaceful accommodation with its Kurdish citizens.

I Went After Guns. Obama Can, Too.

BYLINE: By JOHN HOWARD. 
John Howard was prime minister of Australia from 1996 to 2007.

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; OP-ED CONTRIBUTOR; Pg. 27

LENGTH: 877 words

SYDNEY, Australia
IT is for Americans and their elected representatives to determine the right response to President Obama's proposals on gun control. I wouldn't presume to lecture Americans on the subject. I can, however, describe what I, as prime minister of Australia, did to curb gun violence following a horrific massacre 17 years ago in the hope that it will contribute constructively to the debate in the United States.
I was elected prime minister in early 1996, leading a center-right coalition. Virtually every nonurban electoral district in the country -- where gun ownership was higher than elsewhere -- sent a member of my coalition to Parliament. 
Six weeks later, on April 28, 1996, Martin Bryant, a psychologically disturbed man, used a semiautomatic Armalite rifle and a semiautomatic SKS assault weapon to kill 35 people in a murderous rampage in Port Arthur, Tasmania.
After this wanton slaughter, I knew that I had to use the authority of my office to curb the possession and use of the type of weapons that killed 35 innocent people. I also knew it wouldn't be easy.
Our challenges were different from America's. Australia is an even more intensely urban society, with close to 60 percent of our people living in large cities. Our gun lobby isn't as powerful or well-financed as the National Rifle Association in the United States. Australia, correctly in my view, does not have a Bill of Rights, so our legislatures have more say than America's over many issues of individual rights, and our courts have less control. Also, we have no constitutional right to bear arms. (After all, the British granted us nationhood peacefully; the United States had to fight for it.)
Because Australia is a federation of states, the national government has no control over gun ownership, sale or use, beyond controlling imports. Given our decentralized system of government, I could reduce the number of dangerous firearms only by persuading the states to enact uniform laws totally prohibiting the ownership, possession and sale of all automatic and semiautomatic weapons while the national government banned the importation of such weapons.
To make this plan work, there had to be a federally financed gun buyback scheme. Ultimately, the cost of the buyback was met by a special one-off tax imposed on all Australians. This required new legislation and was widely accepted across the political spectrum. Almost 700,000 guns were bought back and destroyed -- the equivalent of 40 million guns in the United States.
City dwellers supported our plan, but there was strong resistance by some in rural Australia. Many farmers resented being told to surrender weapons they had used safely all of their lives. Penalizing decent, law-abiding citizens because of the criminal behavior of others seemed unfair. Many of them had been lifelong supporters of my coalition and felt bewildered and betrayed by these new laws. I understood their misgivings. Yet I felt there was no alternative.
The fundamental problem was the ready availability of high-powered weapons, which enabled people to convert their murderous impulses into mass killing. Certainly, shortcomings in treating mental illness and the harmful influence of violent video games and movies may have played a role. But nothing trumps easy access to a gun. It is easier to kill 10 people with a gun than with a knife.
Passing gun-control laws was a major challenge for my coalition partner: the rural, conservative National Party. All of its members held seats in nonurban areas. It was also very hard for the state government of Queensland, in Australia's northeast, where the National Party was dominant, and where the majority of the population was rural.
The leaders of the National Party, as well as the premier of Queensland, courageously supported my government's decision, despite the electoral pain it caused them. Within a year, a new populist and conservative political party, the One Nation Party, emerged and took many votes from our coalition in subsequent state and federal elections; one of its key policies was the reversal of the gun laws.
For a time, it seemed that certain states might refuse to enact the ban. But I made clear that my government was willing to hold a nationwide referendum to alter the Australian Constitution and give the federal government constitutional power over guns. Such a referendum would have been expensive and divisive, but it would have passed. And all state governments knew this.
In the end, we won the battle to change gun laws because there was majority support across Australia for banning certain weapons. And today, there is a wide consensus that our 1996 reforms not only reduced the gun-related homicide rate, but also the suicide rate. The Australian Institute of Criminology found that gun-related murders and suicides fell sharply after 1996. The American Law and Economics Review found that our gun buyback scheme cut firearm suicides by 74 percent. In the 18 years before the 1996 reforms, Australia suffered 13 gun massacres -- each with more than four victims -- causing a total of 102 deaths. There has not been a single massacre in that category since 1996.
Few Australians would deny that their country is safer today as a consequence of gun control.

Taliban Escalate Battle With Afghan Spy Agency in Assault on Its Headquarters

BYLINE: By AZAM AHMED; Sangar Rahimi and Jawad Sukhanyar contributed reporting from Kabul, and Taimoor Shah from Kandahar, Afghanistan.

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 6

LENGTH: 574 words

KABUL, Afghanistan -- Heavily armed Taliban attackers in minivans packed with explosives struck the headquarters of the Afghan intelligence agency on Wednesday, detonating one of the vehicles in one of the most secure parts of Kabul and escalating a growing conflict between the two entities.
The explosion went off around noon near one of the gates at the headquarters, killing one agent and wounding at least 30 civilians, some of whom could be seen staggering down the street, covered in blood. A second vehicle, filled with explosives and five gunmen, was stopped by guards, who killed the insurgents and managed to defuse the bomb three minutes before it was set to detonate, officials said. 
The bombing was the latest salvo in a pitched battle between the Taliban and the Afghan intelligence agency, officially named the National Directorate of Security.
Over the past two days, Taliban fighters have claimed responsibility for the deaths of four of the agency's guards across the country. On Wednesday, in addition to the attack in Kabul, two agency guards died while trying to defuse a roadside bomb in Tarinkot, the capital of Oruzgan Province. And on Tuesday, an agency guard was gunned down there by attackers on a motorcycle.
The recent wave of attacks follows the attempted assassination last month of the Afghan intelligence chief, Asadullah Khalid, the architect of the agency's intense crackdown on militants over the past few months. Mr. Khalid, who survived the suicide attack with serious injuries, was flown to the United States for treatment.
The Taliban quickly claimed responsibility for Wednesday's assault and promised to continue targeting the intelligence agency, describing the assault as a tit-for-tat. ''The N.D.S. had been targeting our mujahedeen everywhere in the country,'' Zabiullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, said by telephone. ''We would prefer to target it all the time.''
While Kabul, the capital, is considered safer than the south and east of the country, bombings and attacks from insurgents aimed at undermining confidence in the government's ability to defend itself have been a familiar reality here.
''We are still faced with threats and terrorism, but what is important for us is to show our abilities to deal with such threats and problems,'' said Sidiq Sidiqqi, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry. ''Afghans were their victims today.''
The explosion, which ripped glass and metal from buildings as far as 150 yards away, left a chaotic scene on a snowy afternoon. Security officers scrambled to seal off the scene and within a half-hour had everything locked down, but the cordon also kept Afghan police officers from getting near the site.
The intelligence agency showed the contents of the second vehicle, which was lined with a gel-based explosive that the government said it had never seen before. Five assault rifles, more than 40 grenades and at least 30 banana clips of ammunition were laid out on a tarp beside the vehicle.
Officials claimed the attack as a victory of sorts, having stopped the second vehicle and killed its occupants in six minutes. But the attack rattled those in the neighborhood.
Mohammad Zaki, 15, was in his shop nearby when the bomb went off. He bore the evidence of the blast on his face, where a stream of blood had dried over his left eye.
''What else would I feel but insecure?'' the boy asked. ''Who are these attackers, and why are they killing innocent people?''

Even Defining 'Assault Rifles' Is Complicated

BYLINE: By ERICA GOODE

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 18

LENGTH: 1166 words

One obstacle President Obama may face in proposing a new federal ban on assault weapons could lie in the use of the term ''assault weapon'' itself.
The label, applied to a group of firearms sold on the civilian market, has become so politicized in recent decades that where people stand on the gun issue can often be deduced by whether they use the term.
On Internet forums there is perhaps no more fiercely discussed topic than the question of what constitutes an assault weapon. And some argue that it would be impossible to come up with a definition comprehensive enough to effectively remove the weapons from the market.
Advocates of an assault weapons ban argue that the designation should apply to firearms like those used in the Newtown, Conn., shootings and other recent mass killings -- semiautomatic rifles with detachable magazines and ''military'' features like pistol grips, flash suppressors and collapsible or folding stocks. 
Such firearms, they contend, were designed for the battlefield, where the goal is to rapidly kill as many enemy soldiers as possible, and they have no place in civilian life.
''When the military switched over to this assault weapon, the whole context changed,'' said Tom Diaz, formerly of the Violence Policy Center, whose book about the militarization of civilian firearms, ''The Last Gun,'' is scheduled for publication in the spring. ''The conversation became, 'Is this the kind of gun you want in the civilian world?' And we who advocate for regulation say, 'No, you do not.' ''
But Second Amendment groups -- and many firearm owners -- heatedly object to the use of ''assault weapon'' to describe guns that they say are routinely used in target shooting and hunting. The term, they argue, should be used only for firearms capable of full automatic fire, like those employed by law enforcement and the military. They prefer the term ''tactical rifle'' or ''modern sporting rifle'' for the semiautomatic civilian versions.
They argue that any attempt to ban ''assault weapons'' is misguided because the guns under discussion differ from many other firearms only in their styling.
''The reality is there's very little difference between any sporting firearm and a so-called assault weapon,'' said Steven C. Howard, a lawyer and firearms expert in Lansing, Mich.
The semantics of the assault weapon debate are so fraught that they can trip up even those who oppose a ban.
Phillip Peterson, a gun dealer in Indiana and the author of ''Gun Digest Buyer's Guide to Assault Weapons'' (2008), said he had fought with his publishers over the use of the term in the title, knowing that it would only draw the ire of the gun industry.
After the passage of the 1994 federal ban on assault weapons, Mr. Peterson said, the gun industry ''moved to shame or ridicule'' anyone who used ''assault weapon'' to describe anything other than firearms capable of full automatic fire.
His instinct proved correct: The National Rifle Association refused to sell the book on its Web site, he said. So in 2010, Mr. Peterson produced another version that contained ''90 percent of the same info,'' but was retitled ''Gun Digest Buyer's Guide to Tactical Rifles.'' That book made it onto the N.R.A. site, he said.
Equally controversial are the definitions for which firearms should qualify as assault weapons. Most assault weapons bans have been primarily aimed at rifles like the AR-15, a semiautomatic version of the military's M-16 sold on the civilian market, although certain pistols and shotguns have also been included.
The most basic criteria have to do with a firearm's ability to fire multiple rounds quickly. Because of this, the firearms included under any assault weapons ban are usually semiautomatic, meaning that a new round is automatically reloaded into the chamber but is not fired until the trigger is pulled again. The weapons also have detachable magazines, allowing them to fire 10, 20, 30 rounds or more without the need to insert a new magazine.
After that, however, the definition becomes more difficult. In calling for a renewed ban, Mr. Obama on Wednesday singled out ''military style'' weapons.
Those could include features like a pistol grip, designed to allow a weapon to be fired from the hip; a collapsible or folding stock, which allows the weapon to be shortened and perhaps concealed; a flash suppressor, which keeps the gun's user from being blinded by muzzle flashes; a muzzle brake, which helps decrease recoil; and a threaded barrel, which can accept a silencer or a suppressor. Bayonet lugs or grenade launchers are also sometimes included.
But there is disagreement about which features are worrisome enough to include in a ban. And existing state bans differ in how many features they allow.
Advocates for an assault weapons ban argue that the military features were intended to enhance the firearms' ability to kill.
But many gun owners argue that they are simply ''cosmetic.'' The owners reel off makes and models of firearms -- rifles by Saiga and Remington, for example -- that are mechanically identical to the weapons singled out by bans but that do not have pistol grips or other styling features.
Previous attempts to ban these weapons proved problematic. Loopholes in the 1994 federal assault weapons ban rendered it virtually useless, many believe. And even in states with meticulously written bans, manufacturers have managed to find ways to work around the restrictions.
In the end, said George Lakoff, a professor of cognitive science and linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley, the arguments often come down to language. ''No matter what language you use about guns, it's going to be a problem because it's not just about guns, it's about personal identity,'' he said.
Yet as Mr. Peterson noted in his buyer's guide, it was the industry that adopted the term ''assault weapon'' to describe some types of semiautomatic firearms marketed to civilians.
''Assault rifle'' was first used to describe a military weapon, the Sturmgewehr, produced by the Germans in World War II. The Sturmgewehr -- literally ''storm rifle,'' a name chosen by Adolf Hitler -- was capable of both semiautomatic and full-automatic fire. It was the progenitor for many modern military rifles.
But the term ''assault rifle'' was expanded and broadened when gun manufacturers began to sell firearms modeled after the new military rifles to civilians. In 1984, Guns & Ammo advertised a book called ''Assault Firearms,'' which it said was ''full of the hottest hardware available today.''
''The popularly held idea that the term 'assault weapon' originated with antigun activists, media or politicians is wrong,'' Mr. Peterson wrote. ''The term was first adopted by the manufacturers, wholesalers, importers and dealers in the American firearms industry to stimulate sales of certain firearms that did not have an appearance that was familiar to many firearm owners. The manufacturers and gun writers of the day needed a catchy name to identify this new type of gun.''

Obama Tells Senate That It's Time to Confirm A.T.F. Director

BYLINE: By MICHAEL S. SCHMIDT

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 19

LENGTH: 619 words

WASHINGTON -- President Obama indicated on Wednesday that along with asking Congress to pass measures like an assault weapons ban, he would be increasing pressure on lawmakers to do something they have refused to do for the past six years: confirm a permanent director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.
At a news conference, the president unveiled a series of executive actions and legislative proposals to help reduce gun violence, and he said he would nominate the agency's acting director, B. Todd Jones, to be its permanent leader. 
''Congress needs to help, rather than hinder, law enforcement as it does its job,'' Mr. Obama said on Wednesday.
Mr. Jones, 55, a former Marine who is also the United States attorney in Minnesota, has led the beleaguered agency since August 2011, when he was appointed by the administration to take over in the aftermath of the scandal surrounding the bungled gun trafficking investigation known as Operation Fast and Furious, in which agents lost track of firearms they were allowing to pass into Mexico.
Until 2006, the president had the power to install a director of the firearms bureau without Congressional approval. But under pressure from gun lobbyists, Congress changed the law that year to require Senate confirmation. Since then, the Senate has failed to confirm any nominee by either President George W. Bush or Mr. Obama as senators who support gun rights have used their powers to delay nomination votes; Mr. Jones is the bureau's fifth acting director since 2006.
One of the more vocal critics of the Justice Department and the firearms agency, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, said Wednesday that he agreed with the president that it was time for the Senate to confirm a permanent director of the agency, but he raised questions about Mr. Jones's credibility.
''The new nominee, B. Todd Jones, is a familiar face to the committee, but his ties to the Fast and Furious scandal raise serious questions,'' Mr. Grassley said.
''In any case, he'll receive a thorough and fair vetting by the Judiciary Committee,'' said Mr. Grassley, the committee's senior Republican.
For years, the A.T.F. has been battered by scandals and has had its authority undercut by gun lobbyists, who have pushed to limit its power and cut its funding. The bureau most recently came under scrutiny in 2011 for its handling of Fast and Furious after; two of the firearms used in the investigation were found at the scene of a shootout in which a United States Border Patrol agent was killed in Arizona.
Mr. Jones said in a meeting with reporters in September that during his tenure the agency had refocused its efforts on fighting violent crime and was ''recalibrating'' how it did business by revamping its policies and procedures.
''We are well on our way to tightening up our unity of effort and our communications,'' Mr. Jones said, adding that senior officials in Washington now had more oversight over the agency's field offices.
Mr. Jones said that some procedures had not been updated in 15 to 20 years.
''We are back to the basics, and that is what I have been working very hard at, the fundamentals,'' he said, ''and the fundamentals for us is protecting the American public from violent crime.''
Mr. Jones has told the agency's offices to work closely with police departments in large cities to combat sudden increases in crime and ''to focus on cases that will have the greatest impact,'' a senior agency official said in a recent interview.
This year, A.T.F. agents have been part of so-called surges of law enforcement officers in the country's most violent cities, including Oakland, Calif., and Philadelphia, working to make arrests and seize guns.

Taking Aim

BYLINE: By CHARLES BLOW

SECTION: Section ; Column 0; OpEd; Pg. 

LENGTH: 929 words

This week the president aimed high in the gun debate, and the National Rifle Association aimed low, despicably low.
On Wednesday, the president outlined a broad range of measures -- including universal background checks, a ban on assault weapons, a ban on high-capacity magazine clips, as well as improved data collection and sharing about backgrounds of potential gun buyers. It was all intended to increase public safety over all and make an honest effort to prevent mass shootings and lessen the carnage in the event that there are more
The N.R.A., for its part, released on Tuesday an ad called ''Elitist Hypocrite'' that invoked the Obama children and their Secret Service security as evidence of a president who values his children above those of average Americans. 
It was an outrageous, unnecessary and ultimately stomach-churning ploy to pit the value of some children against others while completely ignoring the longstanding and very real threats that presidents and their families face.
As the Christian Science Monitor reported in November, ''Since 2007, the Secret Service has disrupted several assassination conspiracies -- including some involving white nationalists -- and arrested dozens of people who have made less-than-idle threats against the president.''
Most of us don't have to worry that our children live under the constant threat of harm. Heads of state do. Feigning ignorance of that distinction for political expediency only suggests that you may not be feigning at all.
Furthermore, the president hasn't voiced opposition to more school security. He has, however, said that he doesn't believe that that's the sole solution. In a recent interview on ''Meet the Press,'' the president said, ''I am skeptical that the only answer is putting more guns in schools.''
Lastly, as the White House pointed out in an e-mail to me last month, the administration proposed money for ''Secure Our Schools'' policing grants, which provide funding to improve school safety, ''however, Congress zeroed out the program in 2012.''
In fact, the president's proposal as presented on Wednesday specifically states:
''We need to enhance the physical security of our schools and our ability to respond to emergencies like mass shootings, and also create safer and more nurturing school climates. Each school is different and should have the flexibility to address its most pressing needs. Some schools will want trained and armed police; others may prefer increased counseling services. Either way, each district should be able to choose what is best to protect its own students.''
And one of the president's executive orders reads: ''provide incentives for schools to hire school resource officers.''
On virtually every measure, the N.R.A.'s messaging is off.
The president's proposals, on the other hand, are very much in step with public opinion, which has shifted toward more restrictions, according to a number of polls reported Monday.
A poll by Gallup found that dissatisfaction with America's gun laws has ''spiked'' to 38 percent after the Newtown shooting and the public discussions that followed. As Gallup points out, ''this is up from 25 percent who held this set of views a year ago, and is the highest since 2001.'' That's an increase by more than half in one year -- reversing a trend of continuous decline.
A Washington Post-ABC News poll found that ''most Americans support tough new measures to counter gun violence, including banning assault weapons and posting armed guards at every school'' and that ''[m]ore than half of Americans -- 52 percent in the poll -- say the shooting at the elementary school in Newtown, Conn., has made them more supportive of gun control.''
And a Pew Research Center poll found that most Americans now support a federal database to track gun sales, background checks for private sales and sales at gun shows, preventing the mentally ill from purchasing guns, and bans on semiautomatic weapons, assault style weapons, high-capacity ammunition clips and online ammunition sales.
But as Pew pointed out, ''there is a wide gap between those who prioritize gun rights and gun control when it comes to political involvement.''
The report continued: ''Nearly a quarter (23 percent) of those who say gun rights should be the priority have contributed money to an organization that takes a position on gun policy, compared with just 5 percent of those who prioritize gun control. People who favor gun rights are also about twice as likely as gun control supporters to have contacted a public official about gun policy (15 percent vs. 8 percent).''
This is where gun control advocates -- those who believe that a society can be safer and more civil with fewer rather than more high-powered, high-capacity killing machines -- must have their mettle tested. This is where they must take a stand, become vocal and active, and demand accountability from elected officials, not just now but also in the future.
One of the most profound lessons to emerge from the Newtown tragedy is the power of voice. Americans refused to cede the discussion to the N.R.A. and other gun interests. They refused to buckle to fear or be swayed by propaganda.
Yet too many politicians still quake at the mere mention of the N.R.A. They are more interested in protecting their jobs than protecting society.
The public must make them quake at the idea of doing nothing on this issue.
We must never forget what happened in Connecticut last month and we must never forget what happens in Washington in the coming months.
The tragedy of Newtown must herald the dawn of a new America.

A Snub By Oscars? Affleck Has An Answer

BYLINE: By MELENA RYZIK

SECTION: Section C; Column 0; The Arts/Cultural Desk; THE CARPETBAGGER; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 1079 words

Ben Affleck said to ask him anything. ''Nothing is off limits,'' he said, adding later, ''There's nothing that you can ask me that hasn't been asked of me before.''
Not true. One thing that Mr. Affleck has only recently had to answer for is how it feels to be snubbed by the Oscars. As the director, producer and star of ''Argo'' he was considered a shoo-in for a best director nomination, typically crucial in any campaign for a best picture prize. But last week the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences overlooked Mr. Affleck the filmmaker, though his movie earned other nominations, including best picture.
By Sunday, when he won two Golden Globes, for directing and producing (along with George Clooney and Grant Heslov), he had a line ready about the snub.
''We got nominated for seven Oscars, including best picture,'' he said backstage. ''If you can't be happy with that, your prospects for long-term happiness are pretty sad.'' 
All along ''Argo'' had seemed in step with the awards machinery. In August it was shown at the Telluride Film Festival, where ''The King's Speech'' had earned the attention of critics, and in September its premiere drew a standing ovation at the Toronto International Film Festival, just like the future Oscar winner ''Slumdog Millionaire.'' And as he has made the promotional rounds Mr. Affleck has sounded confident and informed, in his filmmaking and political history at least. What he was not prepared for was going from early front-runner to late-season underdog. But underdog, as veteran Oscar watchers know, is the pole position to be in for the race.
Though only three films have won best picture without a corresponding best director nomination -- ''Driving Miss Daisy,'' in 1989, was the latest -- Mr. Affleck's fortunes, at least judging by the good will that attended his Globes victory, seem to be on the rebound. And it's not as if he's unfamiliar with having to rebound.
''I was nobody auditioning, and then I was seen as this young, emerging talent, writer, Oscar winner'' -- for the ''Good Will Hunting'' screenplay -- ''and then I was seen as this blockbuster actor, and then I was seen as this kind of train-wreck actor'' (insert your own ''Gigli'' joke here) ''and then I was seen as this resurgent director,'' he said in a recent interview in New York. ''And now I think I'm kind of seen as just sort of somebody in Hollywood who works.''
''Argo,'' the true story of how the C.I.A. operative Tony Mendez (Mr. Affleck) used a fake sci-fi flick as cover for his rescue of six American diplomats trapped in Tehran during the 1970s hostage crisis, appealed to him because it played out on a broader scale than his first two hometown directorial efforts, ''Gone Baby Gone'' and ''The Town.'' ''I didn't want to just keep doing movies in Boston,'' he said. (Bostonites, hold your fire: Mr. Affleck plans to return for an adaptation of ''Live by Night'' by Dennis Lehane, who also wrote the novel ''Gone Baby Gone.'')
Mr. Affleck's own performance was inspired by the implacable, reserved Mr. Mendez, a former Master of Disguise.
''I met him at this sort of famous C.I.A. hangout bar, and I thought I'd find all of these interesting hooks to use to play the character,'' Mr. Affleck said. ''Instead I found this very sort of withdrawn, kind of opaque guy, and I sort of panicked.'' But he decided to protect the reality and subvert the usual conventions of hard-charging, heroic protagonists. ''I'd rather have a guy whose instinct is to fade into the background,'' he said, ''who is asked to stick his neck out to save these six people.''
Mr. Mendez, now retired and on the circuit promoting the film, based in part on his autobiography, joined the interview, praising Mr. Affleck for his attention to detail and veracity. He had even offered Mr. Affleck some of his own 1970s clothing to wear, sport coats and polyester prints.
''There was a green turtleneck, which I drew the line at,'' Mr. Affleck said.
''That was my main shirt,'' Mr. Mendez said. ''For an Irish filmmaker you got to have a green turtleneck.''
Mr. Affleck: ''Don't admit that to people.''
Mr. Mendez: ''It's what we call a distracter -- kind of like you are.''
The costumer Jacqueline West and the production designer Sharon Seymour labored to create the right period feel. ''I wanted to spread the wardrobe and the cars out, so it wasn't just everybody was there from 1979,'' Mr. Affleck said. The look for John Goodman's character, John Chambers, a real Hollywood makeup artist, was deliberately 1960s. (''You know, people get stuck in their eras,'' Mr. Affleck said. ''I'm stuck in '93. That's how I do it. Cargo pants are back.'')
Mr. Affleck was also keen to home in on the workaday quality of spy life, especially the way it both connected and frayed its employees and their families. ''The sacrifices that were being made were being done in silence,'' he said. ''We live in a culture now where you go on a talk show and say, 'This is what I've done,' or 'This is the kind of victim I am.' We're very public with that sort of thing.''
By contrast he wanted to pay tribute to C.I.A. officers who risk their lives yet take no credit. ''As Tony often says, it's not a place of deranged assassins,'' he said. ''It's a place of people who've come in to work, work really hard, care about life, care about their country.''
Marrying that vision with the satirical Hollywood story line was the challenge that most worried Mr. Affleck. Mr. Clooney, Matt Damon (Mr. Affleck's childhood friend and ''Good Will Hunting'' co-writer), his brother Casey Affleck, pals like Bradley Cooper and select nonentertainment industry confidants served as sounding boards, helping convince Mr. Affleck that he had nailed the tone.
''It's a little bit of what I did with 'The Town,' '' he said. ''I kind of wrapped what I thought was thoughtful, thematically interesting drama in the hard candy of shootouts and gun chases.''
Though he called ''Argo'' ''the best thing I've been involved with in my career,'' there is one thing he fears will haunt him. With the screenwriter Chris Terrio (also an Oscar nominee) Mr. Affleck included the vulgar punch line that pivots through the movie, a catchphrase that puns on its title and is not quite fit for print.
''I almost wish we didn't do it,'' Mr. Affleck said, ''even though I think it works, because I have doomed myself for at least a few years of strangers coming up to me on the street'' and playfully cursing him in the name of the movie.

Obama Plans to Name Close Aide on National Security as Chief of Staff

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 17

LENGTH: 1145 words

WASHINGTON -- President Obama is planning to elevate a key national security deputy, Denis R. McDonough, to White House chief of staff, administration officials said on Wednesday, making perhaps his closest foreign policy adviser the gatekeeper to the Oval Office.
Though Mr. Obama has not made a final decision, aides said they expected an announcement early next week. Mr. McDonough's appointment would continue the president's practice of putting the people he trusts most in critical positions. Mr. McDonough would succeed Jacob J. Lew, another close aide whom Mr. Obama has nominated as Treasury secretary.
The appointment would also place a national security expert in a job that will require confronting a range of thorny domestic issues, including the budget, gun violence and immigration, as well as dealing with Congress -- a requirement that tripped up at least one of his predecessors.
''It's a new set of challenges for him,'' said former Senator Tom Daschle, the South Dakota Democrat for whom Mr. McDonough worked before joining Mr. Obama in 2007, when he was a senator. But Mr. Daschle said Mr. McDonough had a qualification that trumped his policy background: ''He has an extraordinarily close relationship with the president.'' 
''What the president wants is a fairly tightly knit, cohesive team that he trusts,'' Mr. Daschle said, ''rather than to bring in people who would have to learn anew his style and positions.''
In that regard, Mr. McDonough, an intense, ascetic 43-year-old, may have no peer in the administration. A fervent Obama loyalist, Mr. McDonough has been immersed in every major foreign policy crisis and debate of the president's first term, enjoying a degree of access and a level of trust that go far beyond his age or job title.
Mr. McDonough, his colleagues at the White House say, has a reputation for taking on problems no one else wants. He coordinated, for example, the administration's response to the deadly attack on the American Mission in Benghazi, Libya, and its messy aftermath.
He is also a relentless defender of Mr. Obama, as reporters on the receiving end of angry e-mails or phone calls from him can attest. His blasts have sometimes been delivered during his nightly bike ride home to Takoma Park, Md., where he lives with his wife and three children. (After scrapes with motorists, he now mostly drives.)
Mr. McDonough has mellowed toward the news media, but he expresses little regret about switching his focus to internal policy deliberations in 2010.
As the principal deputy to the national security adviser, Thomas E. Donilon, Mr. McDonough has played a central role in assembling Mr. Obama's second-term national security team, building ties to candidates like Chuck Hagel, the nominee for defense secretary.
He is also close to John O. Brennan, Mr. Obama's chief counterterrorism adviser, who was recently nominated to be the director of the Central Intelligence Agency.
Along with Mr. Brennan, Mr. McDonough was one of a small circle of aides brought into the planning of the raid on Osama bin Laden's hide-out in Pakistan. In a widely published photograph of Mr. Obama and his staff watching the raid unfold in the Situation Room, Mr. McDonough had a seat at the table, next to Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.
He also convened a series of meetings to redefine the American mission in Afghanistan, known informally as ''Afghan Good Enough.'' That helped shape Mr. Obama's narrower ambitions for American involvement, which were on display last week when he announced an accelerated plan to hand over responsibility for security to Afghan forces.
Last year, he proposed Mr. Obama's surprise trip to Afghanistan, which included his unusual prime-time address to the nation about the end of the war, delivered from Bagram Air Base.
Much of Mr. McDonough's power derives from his access to Mr. Obama. Colleagues say he has a keen sense for the president's instincts and preferences and no separate agenda.
''People throughout the foreign policy apparatus found out very quickly that when the national security adviser called, he might be calling for himself or for the president,'' said James Mann, the author of ''The Obamians,'' a book about Mr. Obama's foreign policy team. ''But if Denis McDonough called, he was really calling for the president.''
While Mr. McDonough has mostly exerted influence behind the scenes, he took a high-profile role in coordinating the American response to the catastrophic earthquake in Haiti in early 2010, after Mr. Obama voiced frustration about the slow start of the effort.
Striding around a makeshift headquarters at the airport in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, Mr. McDonough organized aid agencies and briefed visiting officials like Mrs. Clinton. When state officials in Florida tried to halt medical evacuation flights from Haiti, Mr. McDonough got on his BlackBerry to Washington, and the airspace was kept open.
Mr. McDonough's interest in Haiti was an outgrowth of his work on Latin American policy on Capitol Hill, where, in addition to Mr. Daschle, he worked for former Senator Ken Salazar of Colorado and Lee H. Hamilton, a former chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
A native of Stillwater, Minn., Mr. McDonough grew up in a Catholic family of 11 children, one of whom became a priest. He played football at St. John's University in Minnesota, where he was known by the childhood nickname ''Dude.'' A devout Catholic, he once told a reporter that he had given up coffee and candy for Lent.
Mr. McDonough drew on his religious faith when he was dispatched to speak to the faithful at a mosque in Northern Virginia in 2011, bringing a message of reconciliation to Muslim Americans at a time of tension over homegrown Islamic terrorist attacks.
''The bottom line is this,'' Mr. McDonough said in his typically matter-of-fact tone. ''When it comes to preventing violent extremism and terrorism in the United States, Muslim Americans are not part of the problem, you're part of the solution.''
In a rare foray into domestic policy, Mr. McDonough reached out to Catholic Church officials after a flap over the administration's insistence that health insurance plans, including those offered by Catholic institutions, offer birth control to women free of charge.
As a chief of staff, Mr. McDonough may lack the political pizazz of Rahm Emanuel, the backslapping bonhomie of William Daley or the budget-crunching acumen of Mr. Lew. But his friends say that he excels at precisely the kind of trains-run-on-time competence that Mr. Obama needs in a second term.
''The first-term chief of staff ends up being a kind of surrogate on major legislative initiatives,'' said John D. Podesta, who served as chief of staff in President Bill Clinton's second term.

Obama to 'Put Everything I've Got' Into Gun Control

WASHINGTON -- Four days before taking the oath of office, President Obama on Wednesday staked the beginning of his second term on an uphill quest to pass the broadest gun control legislation in a generation.
In the aftermath of the Connecticut school massacre, Mr. Obama vowed to rally public opinion to press a reluctant Congress to ban military-style assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, expand background checks, and toughen gun-trafficking laws. Recognizing that the legislative fight could be long and difficult, the president also took immediate steps by issuing a series of executive actions intended to reduce gun violence.
Surrounded by children who wrote him letters seeking curbs on guns, Mr. Obama committed himself to a high-profile and politically volatile campaign behind proposals assembled by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. that will test the administration's strength heading into the next four years. The first big push of Mr. Obama's second term, then, will come on an issue that was not even on his to-do list on Election Day when voters renewed his lease on the presidency.
''I will put everything I've got into this,'' Mr. Obama said, ''and so will Joe.'' 
The emotionally charged ceremony, attended by family members of those killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., reflected a decision by the White House to seize on public outrage to challenge the political power of the National Rifle Association and other forces that have successfully fought new gun laws for decades.
The White House is planning a multifaceted effort to sell its plans, including speeches around the country by the president and vice president and concerted lobbying by interest groups to influence several dozen lawmakers from both parties seen as critical to passage. The White House created a Web page with video testimonials from victims of gun violence and a sign-up for supporters to help advocate the president's plan.
''I tell you, the only way we can change is if the American people demand it,'' Mr. Obama said. ''And, by the way, that doesn't just mean from certain parts of the country. We're going to need voices in those areas, in those Congressional districts where the tradition of gun ownership is strong, to speak up and to say this is important. It can't just be the usual suspects.''
The N.R.A. made clear that it was ready for a fight. Even before the president's speech, it broadcast a provocative video calling Mr. Obama an ''elitist hypocrite'' for opposing more armed guards in schools while his daughters had Secret Service protection. After the speech the group said it would work to secure schools, fix the mental health system and prosecute criminals but criticized the president's other proposals. ''Attacking firearms and ignoring children is not a solution to the crisis we face as a nation,'' the N.R.A. said in a statement. ''Only honest, law-abiding gun owners will be affected, and our children will remain vulnerable to the inevitability of more tragedy.''
Mr. Obama's plan included 4 major legislative proposals and 23 executive actions that he initiated on his own authority to bolster enforcement of existing laws, improve the nation's database used for background checks and otherwise make it harder for criminals and people with mental illness to get guns.
Mr. Obama asked Congress to reinstate and strengthen a ban on the sale and production of assault weapons that passed in 1994 and expired in 2004. He also called for a ban on the sale and production of magazines with more than 10 rounds, like those used in Newtown and other mass shootings. Mr. Obama's plan would require criminal background checks for all gun sales, closing the longstanding loophole that allows buyers to avoid screening by purchasing weapons from unlicensed sellers at gun shows or in private sales. Nearly 40 percent of all gun sales are exempt from the system.
He also proposed legislation banning the possession or transfer of armor-piercing bullets and cracking down on ''straw purchasers,'' those who pass background checks and then forward guns to criminals or others forbidden from purchasing them.
For Mr. Obama, the plan represented a political pivot. While he has always expressed support for an assault weapons ban, he has made no real effort to pass it on the assumption that the votes were not there. But he and the White House are banking on the idea that the Newtown shooting has changed the dynamics. ''I have never seen the nation's conscience so shaken by what happened at Sandy Hook,'' Mr. Biden said Wednesday. ''The world has changed and is demanding action.''
The future of the plan may depend on how much political energy Mr. Obama puts behind it, not just to pressure Republicans but to win over Democrats who support gun rights. Even the White House considers passage of a new assault weapons ban exceedingly difficult, but there did seem to be some consensus building for expanding background checks.
Senator Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat and a longtime gun control supporter, made no mention of the assault weapons ban in a statement but pointed to the background checks. ''If you look at the combination of likelihood of passage and effectiveness of curbing gun crime,'' he said, ''universal background checks is at the sweet spot.''
On the other side, Representative Robert W. Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia, who is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, dismissed an assault weapons ban as ineffective. ''But in terms of background checks, in terms of keeping weapons out of the hands of criminals and people who have serious mental health difficulties, we want to do that, and we would take a close look at that,'' he told C-Span.
Gun control groups said they would campaign hard for the president's proposals. Mark Glaze, director of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, said his group would focus on as many as 25 Congressional districts, including those of Democrats and Republicans. ''We will be doing what we can do to make sure that sitting on their hands is the least safe place to be,'' he said.
Senator Bob Casey, Democrat of Pennsylvania, a gun rights supporter, said he re-evaluated his position after Newtown. ''I was shaken by it, and that caused me to think in a much more probing way about the policy,'' he said in an interview. ''If it has anywhere near the impact on others that it did on me, then I think the ground shifted a lot.''
But Mr. Obama's plans still generated strong opposition. ''Nothing the president is proposing would have stopped the massacre at Sandy Hook,'' said Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida. ''President Obama is targeting the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens instead of seriously addressing the real underlying causes of such violence.''
Other Republicans echoed those sentiments. ''The Second Amendment is nonnegotiable,'' said Representative Tim Huelskamp of Kansas.
Representative Dan Benishek of Michigan said in a Twitter message: ''Let me be clear, I will fight any efforts to take our guns. Not on my watch.''
Also Wednesday, Mr. Obama nominated B. Todd Jones, the acting director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, to lead an agency that has not had a Senate-confirmed director since 2006.
The 23 executive actions Mr. Obama signed on Wednesday were largely modest initiatives to toughen enforcement of existing laws and to encourage federal agencies and state governments to share more information. Mr. Obama lifted a ban on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from conducting research on gun violence and directed that a letter be sent to health care providers saying doctors may ask patients about guns in their homes.
Several Republicans accused Mr. Obama of flouting Congress. ''Using executive action to attempt to poke holes in the Second Amendment is a power grab,'' said Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa.

In California and now New York, the law is stricter, outlawing any rifle that has any one of six characteristics. (Sources: U.S. Department of Justice

Push for Illegal Immigrants To Get State Aid for College

BYLINE: By KIRK SEMPLE

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 24

LENGTH: 599 words

Responding to more than two years of lobbying by immigrants' advocates, the Democratic majority in the New York State Assembly threw its support on Wednesday behind a comprehensive bill that would make state financial aid available to illegal immigrants at colleges and universities.
The bill would open up several state tuition-assistance programs to illegal immigrants and create a private scholarship fund to help pay for their higher education. 
Elements of the legislation had been proposed in piecemeal in past legislative sessions but had not become law. As a result, immigrants' advocates stepped up their campaign for a more comprehensive and streamlined strategy, centered on a single measure with several provisions.
The Democrats introduced the bill as the immigration debate shifts to the top of the national agenda.
President Obama, who benefited from a record turnout of Latino voters in his re-election in November, has vowed to move quickly on an overhaul of the immigration system, including providing a path to citizenship for most of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the country.
While Democratic state lawmakers are solidly behind the new state bill, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, and Republicans in the State Senate have not said whether they would back it.
The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, said that just as New York this week became the first state to tighten its gun laws after the Connecticut school massacre, so too should it get out ahead in the debate over immigration policy.
''This is an issue that's on the national scene and when New York does something, everybody takes notice,'' Mr. Silver said in a telephone interview. ''I believe it's important that New York puts this out so everyone can take notice.''
He said the bill was justified because many of the immigrants it was intended to help were brought to the country as young children and had been raised as Americans.
''They know no other country, they came as infants, they should have equal access,'' he said. ''It's about fairness.''
If the bill passes, New York would become the fourth state -- after Texas, New Mexico and California -- to offer state financial aid to illegal immigrants. Since 2002, illegal immigrants have been allowed to pay in-state tuition at state universities in New York.
The bill would require that illegal immigrants satisfy certain conditions to become eligible for tuition-assistance programs, including having attended a high school in New York for at least two years and having graduated or received an equivalency certificate in the state. In addition, students would need to have lived with parents or guardians while they attended high school.
The bill, called the Dream Act, borrows its name from a piece of federal legislation, stalled in Congress, that provides a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. Unlike the federal bill, the state measure would not offer young immigrants a chance to gain legal status.
Immigrants' advocates urged state lawmakers to act swiftly on it.
''On substance, it's good because it puts all the ideas in one bill, and politically, it's great because it's clear where the leadership is,'' said Chung-Wha Hong, executive director of the New York Immigration Coalition.
It is not clear how the State Senate, which is controlled by a coalition of Republicans and an independent faction of Democrats, will respond to the measure.
Representatives from a group of immigrant advocacy groups are scheduled to meet with a senior aide to Governor Cuomo in two weeks to discuss the bill and other legislative issues.

As Israeli Vote Nears, Arab Apathy Is a Concern

BYLINE: By JODI RUDOREN; Myra Noveck contributed reporting from Jerusalem.

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 3

LENGTH: 1262 words

BAKA AL-GHARBIYA, Israel -- There are two distinct strains of voter apathy here in what is known as the Triangle, home to many of Israel's 1.5 million Arab citizens.
The first is familiar to citizens in many democracies. ''No one deserves my vote,'' was how Fayez Najmi, who sells fresh fish from a sidewalk in this town of 20,000, put it. ''We don't see any progress or any achievement. We only see the politicians during campaigns.''
The second is more particular to this community. Nidal Jazmawi, who runs a dry cleaners in nearby Umm Al-Fahm and who has lived his entire life in Israel, said he was abstaining because as part of the Palestinian minority he feels his citizenship is meaningless. ''This is not my country,'' he said. ''I don't receive my rights in this state.''
With Israel heading to the polls on Tuesday, the two intensifying sources of apathy are raising new concerns here over the health of Israeli democracy. Experts say a social media campaign to boycott the election and a growing frustration with Arab lawmakers' focus on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, rather than local concerns like crime, poverty and unemployment, threaten to depress Arab turnout below 50 percent. 
That has raised alarm among Arabs and Jews concerned that a long-marginalized minority is increasingly alienated by Israel's right-wing government and by the general tone of the campaign, particularly in the face of international criticism that its treatment of Palestinians within and beyond its borders is discriminatory and undemocratic.
Several Israeli newspapers have run opinion pieces this week calling on Arabs to vote, with the liberal Haaretz newspaper taking the unusual step of printing an editorial also in Arabic. ''Parliamentary elections are the heart of any civic struggle,'' it read. ''Despair and abstention are the worst enemies of such a struggle, and they are luxuries that Israel's citizens cannot afford.''
Ahmad Tibi, a member of Parliament since 1999, said his United Arab List had joined with its two rivals, Hadash and Balad, in Facebook campaigns and election day efforts aimed at persuading voters to go to the polls, noting that in Israel's coalition system, staying home bolsters the largest faction, in this case Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's conservative Likud Beiteinu.
''In South Africa, people were killed struggling to have one person, one vote,'' Mr. Tibi said in an interview on Wednesday. ''In Israel, there is discrimination in every part of life -- education, infrastructure, employment. In only one thing there is equal rights: the day of the election. One person, one vote, Jews and Arabs. Those who are not participating are shooting their own legs.''
While Arab-Israeli participation in national elections has been declining for decades, voters and experts alike said the situation had sharpened this year, citing as causes Israel's political march to the right; the rising view that its conflict with the Palestinians is insoluble; an increase in laws perceived as discriminatory against Arab citizens; and the lack of unity among Arab parties.
''There's a lot of issues of trust in the system, and that drives people away from the polls.'' said Guy Ben-Porat, a professor of public policy at Ben Gurion University who studies the Arab community in Israel.
Capitalizing on these concerns, a group of young activists created a boycott initiative that has gained some traction on Facebook, with an anti-voting rally scheduled for Saturday. ''Voting would be a wrong way to deal with our ambitions,'' said one of the organizers, George Ghantous. ''Under Israel we won't be able to get our ambitions.''
There have been Arab parties in Parliament since Israel's founding, but none have ever been part of a governing coalition (though some Palestinians elected from so-called Zionist parties have). Today, Arabs make up 20 percent of Israel's population of nearly 8 million, and 11 of Parliament's 120 members represent the three Arab-dominated parties -- one religious, one Communist and one nationalist. A new party, Hope for Change, has joined this year's campaign promising to focus only on domestic issues and to join the government regardless of who leads it.
While more than three-quarters of Arab citizens voted in the 2008 municipal elections, turnout for national elections has been spiraling downward for decades, to 53 percent in 2009 (when 66 percent of Israeli Jews cast ballots). A November survey by As'ad Ghanem, a political scientist at the University of Haifa, found it would fall to 51 percent this time, and others predict it will plunge even lower.
If Arabs voted at the same rate as Jews, they could win more than 20 seats and be the second-largest bloc in Parliament. ''It's in our hands,'' said Ghaleb Majadleh, a Parliament member and former minister from the Labor Party whose headquarters is here in Baka al-Gharbiya. Increase turnout by half, he said, and ''Netanyahu would not be in the government.''
Israeli leaders often cite the presence of Arab citizens and their right to vote as evidence of the state's commitment to democracy and equality. But many of the Arab lawmakers reject Israel's self-definition as a Jewish state.
Arab lawmakers and their constituents complain that their communities suffer from scarce jobs, crowded classrooms and a lack of municipal services. ''You drove here: did you see the roads? Have you ever seen a city of 50,000 with no industrial zone?'' Afou Eghbariyeh, a Hadash lawmaker, asked foreign journalists in Umm al Fahm. ''No Ministry of Interior, no Ministry of Transportation; we have no representatives of the government here.''
In Professor Ghanem's survey, 31 percent of those who did not plan to vote said it was because they had no one to vote for, 26 percent said they were not interested in politics and 8 percent each said it was a matter of conscience or their votes did not count. A majority of nonvoters said they would cast ballots if the Arab parties united in a single list. Ibrahim Sarsur, the leader of the United Arab List, said he had tried to join with his rivals for the campaign but decided ''they are not mature enough.''
All three parties have blanketed towns like this one with election banners shouting their slogans: ''The situation needs unity.'' ''We need to live in dignity.'' ''The whole truth.''
The message is getting through to some. ''The more Arabs vote, the more seats we get -- this is important,'' said Aseel Fadoos, 27, a carpenter who stopped at a supermarket here on Tuesday afternoon and plans to vote Balad. A young woman at a children's clothing shop up the street said she was supporting United Arab List because ''if I don't vote, the missing voice, maybe it will go to the extremist parties.''
Said Eghbariyeh, 60, who was sitting on a plastic chair outside a store in Umm Al Fahm smoking and sipping coffee, said he had always voted for Arab parties, but this time would support Meretz, a left-wing faction that pushes peace with the Palestinians. ''The Arabs are only numbers, they have no influence,'' he explained.
Nadim Nashef, the director of Baladna, a Haifa-based youth organization, said his friends had been fiercely debating whether to vote this time, with the boycott campaign ''clearly a louder and stronger voice than before.''
He was torn. ''Israel is using the Arab parties and the Arab citizens voting to say it's a democracy; it's not,'' he said. ''But then we need some kind of voice for our community, some people to speak out against racist rules and racist legislation, and that's the main reason I'm voting.''

Lessons From Guns And a Goose

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; OP-ED COLUMNIST; Pg. 27

LENGTH: 734 words

When I travel abroad and talk to foreigners about the American passion for guns, people sometimes express a conclusion that horrifies me: in America, life is cheap.
President Obama announced a terrific series of gun-control measures to show that we do indeed hold life dear. But the fate of these proposals ultimately will depend on centrist Americans who are torn. They're troubled by the toll of guns but also think that it's reassuring to have a Glock when you hear a floorboard creak downstairs.
So, to those of you wavering, let me tell you the story of a goose. 
I grew up on a farm in Yamhill, Ore., a rural town where nearly every home had guns. My dad gave me a .22 rifle for my 12th birthday, and I then took an N.R.A. safety course.
I understand the heartland's affection for guns, and I share that sense of familiarity. A farm needs a gun or two to deal with coyotes with a fondness for lamb, and, frankly, it's also fun to shoot.
But all those guns didn't make us safer. Take the time we gave a goose to a neighbor.
That goose would wander off to a different neighbor's property and jump into the watering trough for his sheep. The sheep owner was furious that the water would be fouled, and one time he was so fed up he threatened to shoot the goose.
He was probably just making a point, but, since he had a gun handy, he pulled it out and aimed it in the direction of the goose. Seeing this, the goose-owner (who had come to fetch his bird) saw the need to protect his property and pulled out his own gun. They faced off -- over a goose!
Our neighbors were both good, admirable, law-abiding people, but their guns had led to a dangerous confrontation. The N.R.A. might say that guns don't kill people, geese kill people, but in the absence of firearms they wouldn't have menaced each other with axes or hammers.
The sheep-owner's wife eventually persuaded the men to stand down. Good sense prevailed, the goose survived, and so did the neighbors.
But I think of that episode because it underscores the role that guns too often play in our society: an instrument not of protection but of escalation.
Lovers throw plates at each other and then one indignantly reaches for a gun -- maybe just to scare the other. And then, too often, something goes wrong.
One study, reported in Southern Medical Journal in 2010, found that a gun is 12 times more likely to result in the death of a household member or guest than in the death of an intruder. Another study in 1993 found that gun ownership creates nearly a threefold risk of a homicide in the owner's household.
Far too many Americans are like Nancy Lanza, who may have thought that her guns would make her safer, and then was killed with them. Something similar happened in Yamhill, where a troubled teenager took a gun that his grandmother owned and shot her dead. The N.R.A. is right that most guns are used safely, but it's also true that guns are more likely to cause tragedies than to avert them.
President Obama said that there have been 900 violent gun deaths since Sandy Hook, but that was a rare error. He perhaps was speaking of gun homicides only, but he should also include gun suicides -- which are even more common and certainly qualify as violent firearms deaths.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calculates that each year there are more than 11,000 gun homicides and nearly 19,000 gun suicides. That's 30,000 firearms deaths a year in the United States. At that rate, there have already been some 2,500 violent gun deaths since Sandy Hook.
David Hemenway, a public health specialist at Harvard, says that having a gun at home increases the risk of suicide in that household by two to four times.
To reduce auto deaths, we've taken a public health approach that you might call ''car control'' -- driver's licenses, air bags, seat belts, auto registration. The result is a steady decline in vehicle fatalities so that some time soon gun deaths are likely to exceed traffic fatalities, for the first time in modern American history.
There are no magic solutions to the gun carnage in America. But in the same spirit as what we've accomplished to make driving safer, President Obama has crafted careful, modest measures that won't solve America's epidemic of gun violence but should reduce it.
If we could reduce gun deaths by one-quarter, that would be 7,500 lives saved a year. Unless life in America really is cheap, that's worth it.

Report Criticizes School Discipline Measures Used in Mississippi

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 19

LENGTH: 614 words

Less than three months after the Justice Department sued Meridian, Miss., after finding that school students there were routinely arrested without probable cause, a report by a group of civil rights organizations says that ''overly harsh school disciplinary policies'' are common throughout the state.
The report, which is to be released Thursday, found that in one Mississippi school district, 33 of every 1,000 children were arrested or referred to juvenile detention centers; that in another, such referrals included second and third graders; and that in yet another, only 4 percent of the law enforcement referrals were for felony-level behavior, the most often cited offense being ''disorderly conduct.'' 
''The school-to-prison pipeline is nothing new in Mississippi, and it is certainly not unique to Meridian,'' the report says. ''In fact, it is a problem that has plagued Mississippi schools statewide for years.''
In addition to statistics, the report described episodes in which a child was taken home by the police for wearing shoes that violated the dress code, and a school where misbehaving students were handcuffed for infractions as minor as not wearing a belt.
The report also found that, over all, Mississippi imposed out-of-school suspensions at a rate more than one and a half times the national average. In several districts, the rate was more than 9 times the national average, and in one, more than 17 times.
The report comes as lawmakers in many states, including Mississippi, are considering plans to place armed officers or guards in every school, a measure that has gained traction since the shootings in Newtown, Conn. While this report does not focus on that issue specifically, its authors suggest that the presence of more police officers could make a bad problem worse.
''Police who were initially put in schools to handle matters of safety have become involved in ordinary day-to-day disciplinary infractions,'' said Erika Maye, a spokeswoman for the Advancement Project, a Washington-based group that helped prepare the report. The Mississippi chapters of the A.C.L.U. and the N.A.A.C.P., and a group called the Mississippi Coalition for the Prevention of Schoolhouse to Jailhouse, were also involved.
In August, the Justice Department released a letter of findings charging that the police in Meridian routinely arrested children at schools without probable cause, merely on the referral of school personnel. The letter found that students had been incarcerated for ''dress code violations, flatulence, profanity and disrespect.''
In October, the Justice Department sued the city, the county and the state, arguing that the actions violate children's constitutional rights.
Echoing the Justice Department's findings, the report to be released Thursday found that black students were disproportionately more likely to receive the punishments, in both black- and white-majority districts. The authors of the report looked at 115 school districts in the state and found that while black students made up half the student population of those districts, they were more than three times as likely as whites to receive out-of-school suspensions.
On Thursday morning, the Youth and Family Affairs Committee of the Mississippi House of Representatives will hold a hearing on the information in the report, said Representative John W. Hines Sr., the committee chairman. The authors of the report will testify, along with several school officials and parents of children who were the recipients of some of the disciplinary measures. ''It's my preferred way to resolve some of the things without going through the courts and having to have changes mandated,'' Mr. Hines said.

Russian Gangster Fatally Shot On Downtown Moscow Street

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 4

LENGTH: 663 words

MOSCOW -- Not much is known about the underworld kingpin known as Grandpa Hassan, except that somebody really wanted him dead.
Two years ago, assailants rented an apartment across four lanes of traffic from his son's house and then lay in wait for three months for Grandpa Hassan, whose legal name was Aslan Usoyan. When he finally appeared, the gunman wounded but did not kill, hitting his target in the abdomen.
On Wednesday, a better-placed shot over a busy street in downtown Moscow found its mark. Mr. Usoyan, who also survived a 1998 attack, was 75. 
A gunman fired from the House of Actors, a Soviet-era apartment building, apparently while hiding in the attic, Sergei Kanev, a crime reporter for Novaya Gazeta, said of the killing, which was one of the highest-profile contract murders in the Russian capital in recent years.
Mr. Usoyan, an ethnic Kurd from Georgia, was walking out of an Azerbaijani restaurant where he often held meetings, Mr. Kanev said. He was still breathing when he arrived at a hospital but died soon afterward, Interfax reported, citing doctors. There were no immediate arrests.
Since the 2010 attack, Mr. Kanev said, Mr. Usoyan, who bore a passing resemblance to Leonid Brezhnev, ''knew he would die, no matter how he tried to protect himself.'' He added, ''There was no other ending.''
The affair seemed a throwback to the brazen, bloody gangland wars in Russia in the early post-Soviet period, an era of ill-fitting suits, car bombs and drive-by shootings when Mr. Usoyan gained notoriety.
Experts on Russian organized crime said his role was that of a banker -- the underworld term is obshank -- holding a common pot of funds for many different gangs. He also mediated disputes.
''I wouldn't say there was anybody more powerful than Hassan'' in Russian organized crime, Mark Galeotti, an authority on Russian criminality at New York University, said in a telephone interview.
Why he became such a target is still something of a mystery, especially given that violent street crime dropped sharply during the tenure of President Vladimir V. Putin, and other notorious gang leaders, men with nicknames like Little Japanese, Mr. Lisp or Tomato, walked free.
''The mob wars of the 1990s had run their course'' by the time Mr. Putin came to power in 2000, Dr. Galeotti said. ''There were no established pecking orders or turf then, but what came out of those mob wars was precisely a hierarchy and a sense of division of assets.''
And Mr. Putin, he said, let it be known that ''overt gangsterism in the streets that would undermine the authority of the state'' would be punished severely, even while the hierarchy was left intact.
Mr. Usoyan's murder may change that, Dr. Galeotti said, particularly as lucrative construction contracts for the 2014 Winter Olympics and heroin-trafficking routes from Afghanistan are introducing new objects of competition for organized crime groups.
Prosecutors theorize that Mr. Usoyan may have been embroiled in a dispute with his reputed former partner, who is now serving a prison sentence in Spain for money laundering.
Whatever the case, history shows that prosecutors can expect little help from the Russian government in solving the mystery of who killed Mr. Usoyan. According to an American diplomatic cable published by WikiLeaks, American diplomats meeting in 2009 and 2010 with Spanish prosecutors were told that the government of Russia, referred to as the G.O.R., appeared to be cooperating with, rather than prosecuting, organized crime figures.
In return, the prosecutor said, the gangsters ''do whatever the G.O.R. cannot acceptably do as a government,'' like carrying out contract killings of Russian citizens in foreign countries.
On Wednesday, while vowing to investigate, Russian law enforcement officials offered little in the way of sympathy for Mr. Usoyan.
''The fewer bandits, the better for the people,'' Aleksandr Mikhailov, a former deputy commander of Russia's antinarcotics police force, told Interfax.

About-Face as Slumping Hawks Crush Sizzling Nets

BYLINE: By ROB WEINTRAUB

LENGTH: 668 words

ATLANTA -- The Nets' seven-game winning streak came to a thudding end Wednesday night when they were run off the Philips Arena floor, 109-95, by an energetic Hawks team missing its best player.
Atlanta led by 16 at halftime and extended the lead to 26 during a third-quarter spurt, taking advantage of a weary team playing back-to-back games and its fourth game in six nights.
''They ran it down our throats all night,'' Nets Coach P. J. Carlesimo said. ''We played like a team that got in late and was tired, but that doesn't give Atlanta their due.'' 
The Nets could be excused for being overconfident. Not only had they won 9 of 10 since Carlesimo took over as coach last month, but the Hawks were as frigid as the Nets were scalding.
Atlanta had lost six of its last seven, including a 39-point beating in Chicago on Monday. Another mismatch seemed imminent after the Hawks announced the suspension of their leading scorer, forward Josh Smith, before the game, stemming from an undisclosed incident at a practice Tuesday.
Instead, Atlanta dominated from the tipoff, taking advantage of the Nets' lethargy. The Hawks hit 8 of their first 11 shots, scoring more points in the opening two minutes than they did in the entire second quarter in Chicago, when they mustered an embarrassing 5 points, a franchise low.
On Wednesday, a much different Atlanta team shot a season-high 57.7 percent. Six players scored in double figures.
Point guard Deron Williams, who played 43 minutes in the Nets' win over Toronto on Tuesday, was beaten repeatedly on the break and off the dribble by Atlanta guards Devin Harris and Jeff Teague. Teague scored 28 points on 12-for-18 shooting, and Harris chipped in with 18 points.
Brook Lopez led the Nets with 22 points, hitting 10 of 14 shots. The other Nets combined to make only 27 of 73 attempts.
''They had a different gear, a different motor, than we did,'' Williams said. ''We were never really in sync, and a lot of our shots went short.''
The blowout ruined Joe Johnson's return to Atlanta. Johnson spent seven productive seasons with the Hawks, but subpar performances in the postseason, combined with his enormous salary, meant that his trade was greeted with relief that neared glee in Georgia.
Johnson floated through the game, confounded by frequent double teams that took him out of the offensive flow. ''We didn't make the proper reads,'' he said. ''We didn't seem to know where to be when they trapped.''
Johnson made his first field goal with five minutes left in the first half, and he finished with 15 points. He was greeted with a mix of boos and cheers, reflecting his lukewarm relationship with Atlanta fans. A chant of ''We don't miss you!'' rang out as he shot a free throw in the second period.
''It didn't surprise me,'' Johnson said of the reaction. ''I blocked that out. I just wanted us to play well as a team, and we didn't do that.''
The Hawks had a 41-37 edge in rebounds, paced by 13 from Al Horford, who added 17 points for his 20th double-double of the season. More surprising was the effort from Smith's replacement, center Zaza Pachulia, who had 13 points, 11 rebounds and 8 assists.
A sequence early in the second half displayed the difference in effort between the teams. Teague broke wide open off a screen seconds into the third quarter. Moments later, Harris converted an easy three-on-one as the Nets watched from the other side of the floor. On the next possession, Teague raced down the floor to take an outlet pass for an uncontested layup. That made the score 62-42, and the rout was on. Carlesimo called timeout, but he was unable to stop the damage or rouse his team to match Atlanta's intensity.
The teams meet again Friday night at Barclays Center, and Smith is expected to be back in uniform. Carlesimo noted that the Nets' last loss occurred in a blowout on New Year's Eve in San Antonio. ''We bounced back well,'' he said. ''We've got to do it again.''
Johnson added: ''It's not about the Hawks. I expect a different Nets team Friday night.''

White House Denounces Web Video By N.R.A.

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 19

LENGTH: 621 words

WASHINGTON -- The National Rifle Association provoked a furious response from the White House on Wednesday by releasing a video accusing President Obama of being an ''elitist'' and a ''hypocrite'' because he opposes posting armed guards at schools, while his daughters have Secret Service protection.
The video also prompted commentary on social media about whether the gun rights organization might have been too strident, even for its own members. 
The White House lashed out at the N.R.A. even as Mr. Obama stood with young children to unveil broad proposals to create tougher gun laws and use the power of the presidency to keep guns out of the hands of criminals.
''Most Americans agree that a president's children should not be used as pawns in a political fight,'' said Jay Carney, the White House press secretary. ''But to go so far as to make the safety of the president's children the subject of an attack ad is repugnant and cowardly.''
The N.R.A. video refers to Mr. Obama's strong reservations about the group's idea to prevent school massacres by posting armed guards at all of the nation's schools.
''I am skeptical that the only answer is putting more guns in schools,'' Mr. Obama said during a recent interview on the NBC News program ''Meet the Press.'' ''And I think the vast majority of the American people are skeptical that that somehow is going to solve our problem.''
The video, posted at a Web site called N.R.A. Stand and Fight, starts by asking, ''Are the president's kids more important than yours?'' The video does not show Mr. Obama's daughters, Malia, 14, and Sasha, 11, but it suggests that Mr. Obama holds their safety to a different standard than he is willing to offer for other children.
The N.R.A. does not appear to have spent much money paying for the video to run as an advertisement on television. But it still generated ire among Democrats and gun control advocates who said it improperly dragged the president's daughters into the national debate over guns.
Kim Anderson, a top official with the National Education Association, a teachers' union, said the video ''demonstrates a level of insensitivity and disrespect that N.E.A. members wouldn't tolerate in any classroom in America.''
The video prompted quick declarations of outrage among liberal talk show hosts and on Twitter, with many people saying that the N.R.A. had gone too far by referring to the president's children.
But the video also generated expressions of support, with some conservatives criticizing the president for standing with children at his event. On Twitter, N.R.A. backers used the hashtag #standandfight to express support.
''Patriots, we must back the #NRA in their efforts to preserve our liberties,'' one person wrote on Twitter.
The N.R.A. has been the subject of intense criticism in some quarters since the shooting in Newtown, Conn., last month. Shortly after the massacre, Wayne LaPierre, the chief executive and vice president of the N.R.A., held a news conference in which he called for more security in schools and an end to the ''gun-free zones'' that are common around school buildings.
''The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,'' Mr. LaPierre said at the time.
But the organization has said that its rejection of any new restrictions on guns has led to a surge in new members, suggesting that its influence on Capitol Hill is not about to wane.
In a second video posted to its Stand and Fight Web site on Wednesday afternoon, the organization replays parts of Mr. LaPierre's news conference and suggests that the ''elite'' news media and the president are out of touch with everyday Americans.
''America agrees with Wayne and the N.R.A.,'' the four-and-a-half-minute video says.

An Added Mission for Arizona Sheriff's Immigration Posse: School Patrols

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 14

LENGTH: 954 words

GILA BEND, Ariz. -- Dennis Donowick is a retired truck driver who refused to spend the rest of his days ''drinking beer and doing nothing,'' as he put it. Four years ago, he packed his guns and his urge ''to give back to the community'' and joined Sheriff Joe Arpaio's volunteer posse, a group best known for its supporting role in the sheriff's immigration raids.
Last week, the posse, now 3,000 strong, added the task of safeguarding dozens of public schools to its portfolio. 
Putting more armed guards in schools has been proposed by the National Rifle Association and others as a way to crack down on school shootings. Sheriff Arpaio put his own twist on it by simply ordering his posse to keep an eye on school grounds.
He rolled out the program less than a month after the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, where a gunman carrying pistols and semiautomatic rifles killed 26 people, 20 of them children. The program was, he explained, ''to protect our schools from the same type of violence,'' though some people are questioning the risks of placing this responsibility in the hands of armed volunteers when it is taxpayers who would foot the bill for their mistakes.
State Representative Chad Campbell, the Democratic minority leader in the House, said the idea of arming volunteers to patrol the schools was ''ludicrous.'' In a column on Tuesday, E. J. Montini of The Arizona Republic wrote that the posse patrols were a feel-good program that did not do any good.
But Sheriff Arpaio said: ''There's a lot of talking out there. This sheriff does not talk. I take action.''
If a school finds itself under threat, the job of the volunteer posse is to ''eliminate the target,'' said Mr. Donowick, 58, using the military language for shoot to kill.
Every morning, the volunteers go out in cars and uniforms just like those used by the Maricopa County deputies under Sheriff Arpaio's command; there is no way to tell them apart. They roll by, scrutinize the people around the schools, looking for someone they feel does not belong, like ''a guy in trench coat in the middle of summer'' or a driver sitting in a parked car too long, Mr. Donowick said.
On patrol one morning, he carried a 9-millimeter Glock in his holster. In the trunk of his marked Chevy Caprice, he had an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle similar to the one used in Connecticut. Posse members bring their own weapons and buy their uniforms. They receive nine months of training before hitting the streets, and those who are armed -- Sheriff Arpaio said there were about 500 of them -- must be recertified every year.
''I'm prepared,'' Mr. Donowick said.
As he pulled outside Kiser Elementary School here, across from alfalfa fields and next to Interstate 8, he smiled and waved to a teacher and her students as they made their way to class. He talked about the ''halo effect'' of a marked sheriff's car, which can deter some criminal mischief simply by its presence. ''Prevention,'' he said as he drove off, heading west to another school.
Sheriff Arpaio created the posse in 1993 to patrol malls during the holiday season, when thefts in parking lots are common. Since then, the volunteers have gone on to take detainees to the county's jails, escort dignitaries and help deputies serve warrants and support them during raids. It has retirees, including former police officers and military veterans, like Mr. Donowick, who served in Vietnam. An investigation by a local CBS affiliate, KPHO-TV, revealed that several of them also have criminal records -- for assault, drug possession, disorderly conduct and other offenses.
Sheriff Arpaio said that they are ''disciplined accordingly'' and that he has ''faith in them, faith in the posse.''
It began patrolling 59 schools in unincorporated communities in Maricopa County last week. They are mostly small, rural places where the sheriff's office was already providing policing services, so he did not need to seek additional permission to add the school visits to his posse's agenda. He did not contact the schools ahead of time and he did not need money to finance the program because the members of the posse do not get paid for their work.
They are, however, insured by Maricopa County while on the job. Mr. Campbell, who has his own plan to protect schools and toughen the state's gun laws, said of the posses that he was ''not sure how effective'' their officers would be by simply driving around the schools without being on school grounds or interacting with teachers and administrators.
On Monday, in her State of the State speech, Gov. Jan Brewer proposed adding more financing to a program that puts armed police officers inside schools, an idea that has strong support among Republicans and Democrats but still needs legislative approval. She also expressed opposition to arming teachers, a suggestion by the state's attorney general, Tom Horne, in the days after the shootings at Sandy Hook.
In an interview on Tuesday, Timothy Ogle, executive director of the Arizona School Boards Association, said, in a nod to the punishing rounds of state budget cuts school districts have had to endure for several years, that ''politicians are talking about more money for school resource officers, but they have yet to fund the basic needs of our children.'' He added that he would rather see the districts work with local police departments to figure out the best way to protect their schools.
Mr. Donowick, a lieutenant commander in the posse who coordinates the patrols in 24 schools, steered clear of the politics of school safety, saying he was ''out here being constructive.'' His job, he went on, is an antidote of sorts.
''I'm the good guy who is armed looking for the bad guy who is armed,'' he said.

Conviction Tossed Out In '89 Killing In Brooklyn

BYLINE: By MOSI SECRET

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 22

LENGTH: 588 words

A federal judge tossed out the conviction of a Brooklyn man who has spent 23 years in prison for the murder of a local drug dealer, ruling that the trial prosecutor was ''overzealous and deceitful,'' the man's lawyers were ''indolent and ill prepared,'' and the decisions of the original trial judge were ''incomprehensible.''
The ruling Wednesday sets the stage for the release of the man, William Lopez, within 60 days, unless the prosecution decides to try him again. But it is also noteworthy because it is the latest official rebuke of the Brooklyn district attorney's office, which has been faulted repeatedly by judges for misconduct that has put innocent people behind bars. 
A spokesman for Charles J. Hynes, the longtime district attorney who is preparing to run for re-election this year, declined to comment in detail, saying only that the office was reviewing the matter. Although the ruling by the judge, Nicholas G. Garaufis, of Federal District Court in Brooklyn, broadly assailed each of the stakeholders in Mr. Lopez's conviction -- it even called the jury's decision ''bewildering'' -- the initial focus was what the judge called the weakness of the evidence that the prosecution presented at trial. ''The prosecution's evidence was flimsy to begin with, and has since been reduced to rubble by facts arising after trial,'' he wrote.
In 2010, another federal judge called the office's conduct ''shameful'' for the way it handled the case of Jabbar Collins, who later had his murder conviction vacated. In 2011, the office dismissed rape charges against four men after it was revealed that the prosecution against them had continued even after the victim recanted. The office started its own unit to investigate claims of innocence; that unit overturned another case last year.
Judge Garaufis's opinion, which came in response to a habeas corpus petition filed in 2002 by Mr. Lopez, described in detail a case that first went awry because of bad witness testimony.
In 1989, two men entered a crack house in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, and demanded money and drugs from a dealer named Elvirn Surria. One of the intruders shot and killed Mr. Surria with a double-barreled shotgun. They left no murder weapon or forensic evidence at the scene, so the prosecution relied on two witnesses who had been there.
One was Daisy Flores Lopez, who worked as a courier at the crack house. She testified that the gunman was a ''tall, dark, black man'' about six feet three inches in height. Mr. Lopez is more than half a foot shorter and has light skin. In one hearing, which was conducted outside the presence of the jury, a prosecutor asked Ms. Flores Lopez to look around the courtroom and identify the gunman. She said she did not see him, even though the man she had accused, Mr. Lopez, was sitting at the defense table.
Janet Chapman, an unemployed woman with a $200-a-day habit who lived in the basement of the crack house, had just finished a drug binge when the killing occurred; she said she saw Mr. Lopez kill Mr. Surria.
It was later revealed that Ms. Chapman had discussed a cooperation agreement with the prosecution, under which she would testify in exchange for a reduced sentence on a drug charge. Years later, Ms. Chapman recanted her testimony, writing in an affidavit, ''I attended William Lopez's trial and testified against him when I knew my every word was pure fabrication.'' She continued, ''The district attorney told me never to tell anyone that we cut a deal about my testimony, in exchange for my freedom.''

Yuri M. Schmidt, 75, Rights Lawyer in Russia

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROTH

SECTION: Section B; Column 0; Obituary; Pg. 23

LENGTH: 639 words

MOSCOW -- Yuri M. Schmidt, a human rights lawyer who represented critics of the Russian government and others accused of political crimes, died on Saturday in St. Petersburg. He was 75.
The cause was cancer, his colleagues said.
At his death, Mr. Schmidt was leading the defense of the jailed oil tycoon Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, whose imprisonment has been widely condemned by critics of President Vladimir V. Putin as politically motivated.
Mr. Schmidt won many landmark cases in a court system known for ''telephone justice,'' in which party bosses dictated verdicts. 
His most resounding victory came in the case of Aleksandr K. Nikitin, a former Soviet submarine captain who had been charged with espionage and high treason four years earlier after he wrote a series of reports detailing radioactive pollution by Russia's northern fleet. Mr. Schmidt won a succession of court decisions, first to represent Mr. Nikitin and then to obtain his release from prison during the investigation.
In 1999, a St. Petersburg court pronounced Mr. Nikitin not guilty on both counts, and when Russia's Supreme Court upheld the verdict a year later, the courtroom burst into applause.
In a telephone interview, Mr. Nikitin said his defense team had been bitterly divided at first. Its military experts wanted to emphasize that the materials he published were not classified, he said, but the legal experts, led by Mr. Schmidt, feared that a Russian court would not understand the distinction and argued that the focus should be on prosecutors' procedural violations. Mr. Nikitin sided with Mr. Schmidt.
''He could be stubborn. He could be very tough,'' Mr. Nikitin said. ''Some people became convinced that he could not compromise. But he was right.''
Yuri Markovich Schmidt was born on May 10, 1937, in Leningrad, now St. Petersburg. His father, a political dissident, was arrested shortly after Mr. Schmidt's birth and sentenced to 19 years in a prison camp. Mr. Schmidt became a criminal lawyer after graduating from the legal department of Leningrad State University in 1960.
He began representing prisoners charged with political crimes in the late 1980s. His clients included jailed leaders of political independence movements in the ethnic enclaves of Nagorno-Karabakh and South Ossetia as well as a journalist charged with defaming President Islam Karimov of Uzbekistan.
Mr. Schmidt often sought out clients: when a reformist St. Petersburg lawmaker, Galina V. Starovoitova, was found shot to death in an elevator in her apartment building in 1998, Mr. Schmidt found her sister at the funeral, hugged her and told her he would represent the family. His efforts helped lead to the conviction of a gunman and an accomplice in 2005.
His survivors include his wife, Elena, and two sons, Vadim and Mark.
Mr. Schmidt's involvement in Mr. Khodorkovsky's defense also began in 2005. Mr. Khodorkovsky had been arrested two years earlier after declaring his intention to challenge Mr. Putin in the political arena. He was convicted of tax fraud in 2003 and of money laundering and theft in 2010, and is expected to be released in 2014. Amnesty International considers him a prisoner of conscience.
In a statement, Mr. Khodorkovsky said Mr. Schmidt had continued to visit him at the prison, in a remote spot more than 700 miles from Moscow, ''despite being gravely ill.''
''This kind of work is never easy, it can be dangerous, and it's not very lucrative,'' Mr. Khodorkovsky said. ''But then, you never have to make any compromises with your conscience.''
Mr. Schmidt had expressed concern that in addressing rising crime and terrorism, the government was threatening to give the authorities more power and to remove legal and judicial protections. Such a move, he said in an interview in 2004, ''would mean a rollback from the democratic achievements we have made.''

At Strike's Root, Runaway Costs In Busing Pupils

BYLINE: By AL BAKER; Reporting was contributed by Jenny Anderson, Marc Santora, Nate Schweber and Kyle Spencer.

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 1523 words

The day before the start of New York City's first school bus strike in 34 years, a long yellow bus pulled up at Public School 282 in Park Slope, Brooklyn, and the little bodies that popped out could be counted on one hand: Three. The big bus had dropped off part of its cargo earlier, at another school, but in all, 10 children had ridden on a bus fit for about 60.
A similarly large bus pulled up with 17. Finally, a modern-looking bus whose side panel said it could carry 66 children arrived with its passengers: Five children.
''I think in some cases, we have one child on the bus,'' said Kathleen Grimm, the city's deputy schools chancellor for operations. 
The strike that began Wednesday, which idled more than half of the city's school buses and forced about 113,000 children to find new ways to school, was prompted by a fight over union jobs. But its true roots are in an attempt to reform one of the most inefficient transportation systems in the country, one that costs almost $7,000 a year for each passenger, an amount so high that many of those children could hire a livery cab for about the same price. By comparison with the next three largest school districts, Los Angeles spends about $3,200, Chicago about $5,000, and Miami, $1,000.
In New York, the straightforward task of transporting children to and from school has become a morass of good and bad intentions, shortsighted marketplace policies and outright corruption.
For decades, the city has embraced anticompetitive measures and carried on business relations with an array of bus companies, including some that have been implicated in bribery, been under the sway of organized crime and, in one case, run by a man who displayed a pistol at a negotiating session.
Both union leaders and city employees have gone to prison for shaking down bus companies, offering in return labor peace, advance notice of inspections or approval of lucrative extra routes.
Educational policies, driven both by the Bloomberg administration and the federal government, that afford parents greater choice in where to send their children, as well as extended school days, have also helped to drive up costs, in part because of longer distances the buses must travel, along more tailored routes. The special education population has also mushroomed in the last three decades, school officials say, and now represents about a third of the 150,000 students who receive busing, with increasing numbers of them being taken beyond the city's borders. The city in some cases is constrained by how many of these students can be placed on a bus and for how long, which can drive up the number of routes and costs, city officials said. Busing costs the city $1.1 billion today, compared with $100 million in 1979.
Efforts to wrestle down the costs have been delayed by the city's basic needs; a lawsuit; a notorious failed experiment in 2007 when the city tried to revise the busing network in midyear; and an unwillingness to challenge the calcified system that was, in some quarters, popular.
On Tuesday, on the eve of the strike, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said he wished his administration had begun trying to rein in the out-of-control costs ''10 years ago,'' but simply could not get to it considering the rest of his mammoth educational agenda. He uttered more self-recriminations after the strike hit at 6 a.m. on Wednesday.
''I look back and say we should have tackled this,'' he said.
To parents, words of regret did little to salve the chaos thrust upon them and their children.
''I have to go to work; now I'm late,'' Catalina Torres, 51, said as she dropped her three grandchildren at school. Ms. Torres, who works as a teacher's assistant, considered the prospect of the strike lasting more than a week (the last one, in 1979, lasted three months) and said simply, ''Oh my.''
Outside schools, cars bunched up and blocked the streets at times as parents, navigating the drop-off of their children at school for the first time, jockeyed for space at the curb. The police helped keep traffic moving, and according to the mayor's office, had to intervene outside the lots of several bus companies whose workers were not on strike, but whose buses were being blocked by picketing union members. Roughly 3,000 of the city's 7,700 routes were still in operation, those run by companies whose workers are not unionized or not members of the striking Local 1181 of the Amalgamated Transit Union.
Many students were late, and attendance was down only slightly citywide, but by more than one-third at special education programs.
In news conferences, each side pressed its case. Mr. Bloomberg, who wants to put some bus contracts out to open bid for the first time in decades to reduce costs and adapt to a changed school system, argued that a court decision prevents him from forcing the winning bidders to hire currently employed union members. The union says the mayor is misreading the decision and simply engaging in union busting.
''How could it be illegal to put experienced bus drivers and matrons on the school bus?'' Michael Cordiello, the union president, said while addressing reporters near a picket line in Ridgewood, Queens.
The union also released a graphic advertisement on YouTube showing the mangled wreckage of yellow school buses as a children's chorus sings the familiar song about the wheels of the bus going round and round.
''When inexperienced drivers take your kids to school, sometimes they never get there,'' a female narrator intones, before laying the blame for the strike -- and any harm it causes -- on Mr. Bloomberg.
The mayor's aides say the fight is not about the drivers, but about changing a system troubled by archaic contracts from another era.
The history behind the current standoff can be traced back at least to 1979. Before then, a single company, Varsity, ran most of the roughly 2,000 bus routes. According to former Mayor Edward I. Koch, the schools chancellor at the time believed opening the bus contract to bids would save money. But, Mr. Koch said, it did not. And when the city put out the routes for bid, it did so without the job protections that had previously been in place. That touched off a strike that featured Operation Kiddie Lift, a thrown-together effort by city correction officers to ferry disabled children in buses borrowed from Rikers Island.
The city decided to end things. A judge brokered an arrangement that required the city's 70 or so new bus vendors to hire the old union labor, setting in motion the job security clauses known as employment protection provisions that are at the heart of the current dispute.
''The pressures became so great,'' Mr. Koch recalled on Wednesday. ''The mothers and parents were so distressed.''
From 1979 on, the city did not again put out its contracts to open bid. Typically, it would simply renew its contract with the companies it was already using. In 1995, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani backed off a plan to reopen contracts to bid after the union threatened a strike.
The city was often loath to change companies, in part because it feared the disruption that canceling their routes might cause.
''The department was put in a position where it had its back against the wall,'' said Eric S. Goldstein, the chief executive for school support services for the Education Department. ''The bus companies negotiated as one bloc and the contracts needed to be extended.''
In one 2010 negotiating session with Mr. Goldstein, Domenic Gatto, the chief executive of Atlantic Express, one of the major bus companies, took out a loaded gun and said, according to court documents, ''I know how I protect myself, so no one's gonna intimidate me, this is how I protect myself, should we continue the talk?''
He was charged with menacing and unlawful possession of a weapon on school grounds. The court file did not say how the case concluded, but Peter R. Silverman, a lawyer for Atlantic Express who was in the room, said Mr. Gatto never meant to threaten anyone and was merely rebutting a suggestion that he had been cowed by the union. Mr. Silverman said the case was settled with a ''noncriminal violation.''
About six years ago, an attempt to make the city's routes more efficient was drawn up with the help of a consulting firm. But the rollout of the new routes in January 2007, in the dead of winter and the middle of the school year, led to widespread confusion, stranded children and ultimately abandonment of the plan.
By comparison, Wednesday was only slightly less chaotic, as parents had been given advance warning. But it still took a toll on parents like Miriam Davenport, a dental hygienist in the Bronx, and mother of a kindergartner.
She said that she had to cancel several appointments Wednesday morning, and that since she was paid by the hour, it would mean less money in her paycheck. Normally, she leaves her home in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, before 7:30 a.m., shortly after the bus picks up her daughter. At 8:45, she was just dropping her daughter off at school.
''I feel bad about what the bus drivers are going through,'' Ms. Davenport said. ''But I'm losing pay in order to accommodate what's going on.''

Gun Reform for a Generation

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; EDITORIAL; Pg. 26

LENGTH: 1137 words

We usually cringe when politicians drag ordinary people onstage for their events. But the four children who appeared with their parents and President Obama in the White House on Wednesday at his announcement on gun control proposals drove home the nature of the crisis facing the country. While guns and gun control have been a subject of debate among politicians and lawyers and lobbyists and pollsters and political groups in the center and on the fringes, our children have been living in a free-fire zone for sociopaths with virtually unfettered access to instruments of mass murder.
It is past time that elected leaders did something about it without worrying, as Mr. Obama said on Wednesday, about getting ''an A grade from the gun lobby.'' It has been a bipartisan betrayal of the public's safety, the fault of Democrats and Republicans, and of a string of presidents who have said mournful things after the mass murders at Columbine and Virginia Tech and Aurora and Newtown but did not act. 
Wednesday was the exception. One month after the Newtown, Conn., murders, Mr. Obama presented a comprehensive set of initiatives that was, for a change, structured around what needs to be done and not what political tacticians think the president could get a dysfunctional Congress to pass. Mr. Obama can be frustrating at moments like this, and his delivery today was as professorial as ever. But he stepped up to the broader issue before the nation in remembering the tragedy at Newtown.
''While there is no law or set of laws that can prevent every senseless act of violence completely, no piece of legislation that will prevent every tragedy, every act of evil,'' he said, ''if there is even one thing we can do to reduce this violence, if there's even one life that can be saved, then we've got an obligation to try.''
Mr. Obama said he believes the Second Amendment bestows an individual right to own guns. We have disagreed with that position, but it is now the law as judged by the Supreme Court, and as Mr. Obama said so passionately, it should be no impediment to gun regulation.
''Along with our freedom to live our lives as we will comes an obligation to allow others to do the same,'' Mr. Obama said, noting that 900 people have died in gun violence since Newtown, a vast majority of them on the streets of ''big cities and small towns.''
We have ''the right to worship freely and safely; that right was denied to Sikhs in Oak Creek, Wis.,'' Mr. Obama said. ''The right to assemble peaceably; that right was denied shoppers in Clackamas, Ore., and moviegoers in Aurora, Colo. That most fundamental set of rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, fundamental rights that were denied to college students at Virginia Tech and high school students at Columbine and elementary school students in Newtown; and kids on street corners in Chicago on too frequent a basis to tolerate.''
Mr. Obama's announcement was preceded by a blast of propaganda from the far right that his proposals would be confiscatory and tyrannical. Anyone who was paying attention to the news in the last couple of weeks knew that this was nonsense, and the proposals announced on Wednesday were not remotely similar to what the gun lobby wanted Americans to believe they would be. They will not limit any law-abiding American's right to own guns for hunting, or sport, or collection, or self-protection.
The package is a mix of executive orders intended to tighten and heighten enforcement of existing gun laws and sweep away ideologically motivated restrictions on government action against gun violence, and new laws that will have to be passed by Congress.
Mr. Obama's bills would require universal criminal background checks for all gun sales, doing away with the loopholes for gun shows, private sales and Internet sales that have exempted 40 percent of all gun sales from those checks. He called on Congress to reinstate and toughen the ban on assault weapons that was allowed to expire in 2004. He wants to restore a 10-round limit on ammunition magazines and to ban armor-piercing bullets that are used by criminals to kill police officers. The president asked Congress to pass a $4 billion measure intended to retain 15,000 police officers who are being laid off as states and localities react to the recent recession and to budget cuts from Washington.
Mr. Obama also issued executive orders to make the background checks system more comprehensive and strengthen enforcement of existing gun laws. He is ending a freeze on research into gun violence at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that was imposed by lawmakers at the behest of a gun lobby that is terrified by the prospect that gun violence could be viewed, as it should be, as a public health issue. He also signed an order making it clear that doctors and other health care providers are not prohibited by any federal law from reporting their patients' threats of violence and that the health care reform law ''does not prevent doctors from talking to patients about gun safety.''
Mr. Obama and Vice President Joseph Biden Jr. acknowledged that getting any of the president's proposals through Congress was going to be a herculean task. Mr. Biden said, ''I also have never seen the nation's conscience so shaken by what happened'' in Newtown. We have hoped, too, that the murders last month would finally inspire action, especially if Americans pressured their representatives in Congress to do something about this crisis.
Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden will have to make good on Mr. Obama's promise to do everything they can to fight for these proposals in Congress -- and that will mean twisting arms and making threats to members of his own party as well as to Republicans.
The gun lobby is focused within the Republican Party, but Democratic lawmakers have also been to blame for failing to pass meaningful gun regulations. Already, some Democrats who should be strongest on gun controls are showing familiar signs of weakness.
Senator Pat Leahy, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, will be needed as a leader in this effort but has been mumbling about the need to hold extensive hearings. And Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, was making ominous, cowardly remarks over the weekend about tailoring whatever the Senate does to what he thinks could get through a House dominated by the far-right fringe of the Republican Party. He has started to wriggle away from the idea of an assault weapons ban, for example.
This is not a time for lawmakers to do the politically safe thing or the N.R.A.-approved thing, even if they know it is less than needed. It is time to reach for big ideas and strong laws on gun violence.
This is part of a continuing series on the epidemic of gun violence and possible solutions. Other editorials are at nytimes.com/gunchallenge.

Another Face-Off for Nuclear-Armed Rivals

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; EDITORIAL; Pg. 26

LENGTH: 541 words

One of the likeliest flash points for a nuclear war is the enduring conflict between India and Pakistan, which have scores of nuclear weapons. In recent weeks, several fatal incidents across the disputed Kashmir border have stoked new fears that the firing of bullets could escalate into something even worse. 
The latest conflict began on Jan. 6 when Pakistani and Indian troops exchanged gunfire across the Kashmir border, leaving one Pakistani soldier dead. Two days later, another confrontation resulted in the deaths of two Indian soldiers, one of whom was beheaded. A third incident occurred on Jan. 10 when the Pakistani Army said that Indian soldiers shot and killed a Pakistani soldier. On Wednesday, Pakistan accused India of killing another of its soldiers, making the past two weeks the worst for violence in the Kashmir region since a cease-fire was reached in 2003.
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India, who has advocated rapprochement with Pakistan, said this week that the recent hostilities had made a continued thaw in relations impossible. And India's new army chief, Gen. Bikram Singh, has threatened to retaliate for the killings of the Indian soldiers. He said at a news conference on Monday that he had directed his military commanders to be ''aggressive'' in the face of provocations. For its part, Pakistan has dismissed India's charges and accused it of violating the line of control in Kashmir.
The confrontations are especially disturbing because India and Pakistan, which have fought three wars, have made some progress in their relationship over the past year, allowing more travel across the border and better trade ties. Both countries face huge challenges, including the need for economic growth, and neither can afford another war.
Pakistan's internal crisis makes the volatile situation worse. Barely one year after fears of a possible military coup plunged the country's politics into chaos, the civilian government is besieged on multiple fronts just a few months ahead of elections.
On Tuesday, the country's supreme court ordered the arrest of Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf in a corruption case. The court forced the resignation of another prime minster in June, and the current move has stoked speculation that the powerful army is the unseen hand, trying to delay general elections set for the spring and to reimpose a military-backed government. Adding to the turmoil, a preacher turned politician has suddenly begun leading huge protests and calling for the government's ouster while a vicious insurgency continues its violent campaign to try to bring down the state.
Since the border skirmishes, local Indian and Pakistani military commanders in Kashmir have held at least one meeting on the incidents. There were news reports on Wednesday that senior commanders from the two sides had agreed to calm the situation. Speaking in New York City, also on Wednesday, Pakistan's foreign minister, Hina Rabbani Khar, proposed a meeting with her Indian counterpart to recommit to the cease-fire. That makes good sense.
Difficult politics in both countries make new confidence-building measures unlikely at this time. Still, neither side would gain if the nuclear-armed rivals stumbled into a full-blown conflict.

Fighting for Light Amid Urban Noir

BYLINE: By MANOHLA DARGIS

SECTION: Section C; Column 0; Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk; MOVIE REVIEW; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 1013 words

After sundown the familiar, big, beautiful, soul-dirty town in ''Broken City'' looks as if it were built from shattered glass. That's especially true from the air, where the director, Allen Hughes, likes to take a god's-eye measure of what's below, the camera gliding over the glittering lights and shadows as black as the abyss. This is a place so ominous that the sun never seems to shine, leaving the gray streets and people washed in an icy blue light. One glance and it's obvious that this is New York, though it's a city Mr. Hughes has painted a darker shade of noir. 
Mr. Hughes has always been a noir kind of director, from his first movie, ''Menace II Society,'' to his most recent, ''The Book of Eli.'' Along the way his features -- all except ''Broken City'' were directed with his twin brother, Albert -- have shifted from youthful nihilism to pessimism to a less totalizing pessimism, one that leaves room for something approaching or at least nodding toward hope, change, possibility. The exits, in other words, are no longer completely blocked. Whether this reflects age, a philosophical shift or studio pressure, the movies feel less closed in than they once did. There's plenty of bleak to go around in ''Broken City,'' yet there is also more tonal variation and a worldview that hews toward human complexity rather than toward comic-book Manichaeism.
The screenplay remains the weak link in Mr. Hughes's work. But if you don't listen to the dialogue too hard, if you tune out a bit and instead watch the screen -- notice how the restless cameras prowl around the actors and how shards of bright color pierce the pooling black night -- then ''Broken City'' satisfies like the solid B movie it is. Written by Brian Tucker, the story traces, if somewhat distractedly, the moral education of Billy Taggart (Mark Wahlberg), a cop who, shortly after the movie opens, shoots a man dead and is forced to turn in his badge. It's the sort of blunt, early narrative shock, a triggering incident, as it were, that strongly suggests where the rest of the story will lead.
In ''Broken City,'' though, the question of whether Billy is a good or bad man, a decent or dirty lawman -- and the equally important matter of whether the shooting was justified -- hovers in the background like a half-finished thought. One reason is that Mr. Tucker, who's also a playwright, thickens the plot of this, his first produced feature, with a larger-stakes corruption tale involving the mayor, Hostetler (Russell Crowe, miscast but charismatic), the mayor's wife, Cathleen (Catherine Zeta-Jones, classing up the joint nicely) and an assortment of courtiers and connivers, including a Machiavellian police commissioner, Fairbanks (Jeffrey Wright, bearded, bald and sly). Also stirring up trouble is a mayoral rival with wet, beseeching eyes and a cartoon name, Jack Valliant (Barry Pepper, very fine).
Much of the story takes place seven years after Billy has left the police force. Now he works as a private detective and keeps odd hours in his enviously situated Brooklyn office. His name is on the door, and there's a pretty blonde, Katy (Alona Tal), taking his messages at a desk. Given the old-school setup, and the intimations of gumshoes and genres past, the blonde should be giving her boss the once over as she straightens the seams on her stockings. Mostly, while clearly soft on him, she just pleasantly nags Billy for not chasing down delinquent clients. He's that type of guy, which is another reason that doubts about his character never loom especially large. Although, really, it's Mr. Wahlberg's native good-guy appeal that keeps doubts at bay.
With his muscled body, untroubled face and singsong Bostonese, Mr. Wahlberg was built to play regular, hard-working, light-thinking Joes who, even when they're on the wrong side of the law, are never on the side of the damned. Unlike Mr. Crowe, whose peering, wary eyes always make it look as if he's working an angle, sussing out the competition (and co-stars) to gain an advantage, Mr. Wahlberg often looks almost surprised by what's happening around him. That may not always be a useful quality for a detective, but it can work well for a filmmaker and an ethically and narratively challenged protagonist. In ''Broken City'' Billy is always lagging behind events and other people, running into a scene after a deadly shot has been fired, misinterpreting gestures and making missteps that only make him vulnerable.
There are not many surprises in ''Broken City,'' despite its puddling, sometimes muddling mysteries. This is a story, after all, about power and its abuse in the city, and eight million of these have been told before. Mr. Hughes tells this latest iteration with characteristic technical virtuosity, and while he's overly fond of circling camera movements, the silky, gyrating choreography of the cinematography does create a sense of a spinning web that works reasonably well. His visual choices can feel borrowed and clichיd, but his regard for beauty often compensates for his blunders, as does the sturdy, reliable appeal of another story of good and evil, men and women, light and dark, glass and steel, sex and power. As it turns out, there are eight million and one stories in the naked city.
''Broken City'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Adults behaving badly.

Christie Forms Panel on Firearms and School Safety

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 21

LENGTH: 499 words

After facing sharp criticism for not mentioning gun violence in his State of the State speech, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey appointed a task force on Thursday to examine gun control measures and school safety, as well as look at some of the underlying problems behind gun violence, including addiction and mental illness. 
On school safety, Mr. Christie, a Republican, said that he did not believe that putting armed guards outside schools was the answer for his state, but that he would be open to all of the ideas that the task force, led by two former state attorneys general, came up with. He has asked for the group to make its recommendations in 60 days.
''Violence in our society has never been solely about firearms, and we would miss an opportunity to better prevent heinous crimes if we didn't look at the complete picture,'' Mr. Christie said at a news conference in Trenton. ''If we are truly going to take an honest and candid assessment of violence and public safety, we have to look more deeply at the underlying causes of many acts of violence.
''That means removing the stigma and evaluating issues of mental health, addiction, prevention and treatment services alongside the effectiveness of our firearms laws, enforcement mechanisms and our school safety measures.''
Mr. Christie, a former federal prosecutor, declined to comment on President Obama's proposal for a federal ban on assault rifles and other measures, saying that he was focusing his efforts inside the state. He noted that the state already has such a ban and limits the rounds of ammunition in a magazine to 15. The president's proposal recommends 10.
But he did weigh into the controversy over the National Rifle Association's mentioning Mr. Obama's children in an advertisement unveiled this week. The advertisement, which heralds the N.R.A.'s proposal to put armed guards at schools, notes that the president's children are provided with protection by the Secret Service.
Mr. Christie called it ''reprehensible'' to refer to the children and said that such actions undermined the organization's credibility and efforts to make its case.
When asked if he was concerned about the organization's political power as he considered what steps to take in New Jersey to reduce gun violence that could include stricter gun measures, Mr. Christie said, ''I don't worry about the N.R.A.'' He added that he was not worried about people who are gun control advocates, either.
''I am willing to listen to all of them,'' he said. ''As you know, I don't spend a lot of time worrying.''
In contrast to the swift action by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and lawmakers in New York that led to tighter gun measures this week, Mr. Christie did not mention guns as he laid out his legislative agenda in his speech last week. With the task force, he said, he has decided to take a more ''deliberate approach'' to address concerns in the aftermath of the shootings in Newtown, Conn., that killed 20 children and 6 adults at an elementary school.

Long Line of Reputed Mobsters Dragging Nicknames Through Mud

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WILSON

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; CITY ROOM; Pg. 19

LENGTH: 575 words

One of them is believed by the authorities to be a mob associate who extorted owners of garbage-hauling companies in New York City suburbs. The other is believed to be at least 542 years old, very short and wise, with blue skin and a white beard.
One was arrested on Wednesday. The other stays close to his village, far from humans and laws and garbage-collection companies. 
But they have the same name: Papa Smurf.
Fascination with mob nicknames goes back long before Vincent (Chin) Gigante, before Salvatore (Sammy the Bull) Gravano and Thomas (Tommy Karate) Pitera. For generations, G-men have been studiously scribbling down nicknames overheard on wiretap recordings for tough guys with tough nicknames like -- literally -- Thomas (Tough Tommy) Contaldo, Ettore (Killer) Coco and Anthony "Tony Miserable) Vellucci.
The nicknames were often the only names the federal agents had, as nobody seemed to know their names given at birth.
But what of the Papa Smurfs? The ones who, perhaps in name only, were not tough? Carmelo Sansone, born in 1912, was an important Mafia drug trafficker in New York City. Why did people call him Schnozzola?
Earl (Squint) Coralluzzo, we're looking at you. Sorry -- squinting.
The suspect nicknamed Papa Smurf has the government name Carmine Franco. It was not clear on Thursday where his nickname came from, although photographs show a grandfatherly looking man who may very well dispense wisdom to younger generations like the blue-skinned Papa Smurf.
Most nicknames are firmly in place long before a mobster-to-be is out of short pants.
"It probably comes from childhood," said Edward McDonald, the chief of the Eastern District Organized Crime Strike Force in the 1980s, and later, a defense lawyer. "Every guy in the neighborhood had a nickname, some dopey nickname."
Hence, say, Alphonzo becoming Funzy. A funny name for a tyke in his diaper; less so for the grown man with the fruit stand and the gun, but there it is.
The authorities arrested nearly 125 suspected mobsters in a swoop in January 2011. Among the names on the indictment were Vinny Carwash, Tony Bagels and Junior Lollipops.
Richard Cantarella was a capo in the Bonanno crime family until he testified for the government in a murder trial and entered the Witness Protection Program. Only he and his closest circle know whether he is still called Shellackhead, for his liberal application of pomade.
Vincent Basciano was called Vinny Gorgeous because he owned a hair salon called Hello Gorgeous in the East Tremont section of the Bronx. But you know what? Not a bad looking guy. Gerlando Sciascia, on the other hand, was presumably easier to find. You just had to ask for George from Canada.
And nicknames aren't limited to mobsters in America. On Wednesday, a well-known Russian gangster was on the wrong end of a bullet that killed him as he walked out of a restaurant in Moscow. He was popularly known as Grandpa Hassan.
Some nicknames come not from crazy Uncle Vinny at birth, or from fellow mobsters, but from the police. The boss of the Colombo family, Carmine Persico, was Junior to his pals but called The Snake by the authorities. Another Colombo figure, Hugh McIntosh, was "Mac" to some, but, to the police, he was "Apples." And then, of course, there was the Teflon Don.
The list goes on, and on, and on. But pretty soon you start sounding like George (Blah-Blah) Smurra.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Democrats Are Split Over How to Shape Approach to Gun Bills

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER; Ashley Parker contributed reporting from Williamsburg, Va., and Michael D. Shear from Washington.

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 16

LENGTH: 1042 words

WASHINGTON -- As Congressional Democrats shape their strategy for considering President Obama's proposals to curb gun violence, sharp divisions are forming between lawmakers who believe the best path to success is through narrowly written bills and a meticulous legislative process, and those who advocate a more guerrilla approach.
Many Democrats, and some Senate Republicans, believe the only legislation that has a whisper of a chance of passing would be bills that are tightly focused on more consensus elements like enhancing background checks or limits on magazines, subjected to debate in committee and then brought to a vote after building bipartisan support. 
That would be a departure from recent years, when the leadership often sidestepped committees and sought to take fights directly to the floor.
Others, particularly those senators who have long fought for gun control measures, believe a plodding process allows too much time for opposition to build, and prefer to fast-track measures by adding them as amendments to other bills, even blocking bills in ways that have angered Democrats, until they are granted votes on those ideas.
''We can't sit around for months talking and letting the gun lobby run out the clock,'' said Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey. ''If we're going to make progress, it's essential that we move quickly and start voting as soon as possible.''
Democrats are united on one point: For any legislation to reach the Senate floor, Mr. Obama will have to put the full weight of his office and bully pulpit behind it.
Without constant public pressure and a concerted effort to woo conservative Democrats, especially those up for re-election in red states in two years, there will be little impetus, numerous Democrats said, to move legislation along. Democrats also may be forced to decide whether to endure a lengthy legislative battle on guns at the expense of priorities like immigration.
Recognizing that public pressure is going to be required to move such contentious measures, the president's former campaign aides in the weeks ahead will convert the Obama for America operation into a different kind of outside political group led by Jim Messina, Mr. Obama's former campaign manager, according to people familiar with the plans. The new organization will be able to raise money for grass-roots campaigning on behalf of the president's second-term agenda, they said.
Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader who has spearheaded other legislation desired by the White House, will take a more passive role with any gun legislation, aides to Senate Democrats say, letting the administration set the agenda and allowing senators to press ahead through their committee leadership or interest in the issue.
Mr. Reid, who was deeply disturbed by the shootings last month in Newtown, Conn., is a longstanding gun rights supporter, a necessity for any statewide official from Nevada.
Mr. Obama's efforts on Capitol Hill will provide the most crucial test of whether the mass shooting in Newtown, and the obdurate response from the National Rifle Association, has ushered in a new chapter in a legislative era that began in 2004 with the expiration of the assault weapons ban. Since that time, most new gun legislation has emerged in statehouses, and Washington has largely enforced gun rights.
The political sensitivity around guns can be gauged somewhat through the measured statements of lawmakers long associated with gun rights.
''Some have asked whether I will try to block or filibuster this debate because of my support of the Second Amendment,'' said Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, who in 2009 sponsored a successful measure that repealed a gun ban in national parks. ''My goal is the opposite. I believe Congress has a responsibility to review all of our laws and make adjustments as necessary in a transparent, open and deliberative manner.''
Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee and has a mixed legislative record on guns, said the first hearings he would schedule in the new Congress would be on gun legislation. Mr. Leahy was the only senator to attend an event with Mr. Obama this week to announce his push on gun laws.
''Our hearing will be a first and essential step to building the kind of consensus needed for any legislation to move forward,'' Mr. Leahy said, ''and I look forward to leading that discussion.''
Senate Democrats break down into roughly three groups when it comes to guns. There are those like Senator Dianne Feinstein of California and Mr. Lautenberg, who have long labored to strengthen gun control laws.
On the other end of the spectrum are members like Senator Max Baucus of Montana, whose N.R.A. scorecard is indistinguishable from those of conservative Republicans. A third group, many of them up for election in 2014, have expressed tepid support for any gun regulation and will be a likely impediment to some, if not all, of Mr. Obama's agenda, especially a proposed renewal of the ban on assault weapons.
Noting her ''strong'' record of support for the Second Amendment, Senator Mary Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, said: ''That said, last month's tragedy in Newtown, Conn., has become all too familiar. We must find a way to balance our Second Amendment rights with the challenges of mental illness, criminal behavior and the safety of our schools and communities.''
House Republicans are unlikely to bring legislation to the floor at all without clear Senate action, although a spokesman for Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the Republican majority leader, would not commit either way. House Republicans have said they would look at anything the Senate passes.
''I just don't like it when you sort of put false hope out there,'' Representative Greg Walden of Oregon said Thursday at the House Republican retreat in Williamsburg, Va.
Speaking to the United States Conference of Mayors on Thursday, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. vowed that the administration would ceaselessly press its case. ''We're going to take it to the American people,'' he said. ''We're going to go around the country making our case, and we're going to let the voices, the voices of the American people be heard.''

An article on Wednesday about President Obama's decision to encompass mass shootings and everyday violence in his gun proposal misstated part of the requirement that federally licensed firearms dealers run background checks. The background checks are required for guns sold by licensed dealers at gun shows; it is not the case that such guns are not covered by the requirement.

The Last Stand

BYLINE: By NEIL GENZLINGER

SECTION: Section C; Column 0; Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk; MOVIE REVIEW; Pg. 10

LENGTH: 246 words

During a delicious 60 seconds or so in Arnold Schwarzenegger's new movie, ''The Last Stand,'' two bad guys are dispatched to their eternal punishment in memorable fashion. It may say something about Mr. Schwarzenegger's post-gubernatorial future in action movies that he is not the trigger man in either killing. 
''The Last Stand'' gives Mr. Schwarzenegger his first major role since he left the California governorship, and, sure, he fires some guns and gets a few of those Schwarzenegger one-liners (though none likely to achieve the catchphrase status of ''I'll be back''). But other heroics are parceled out to a supporting cast that includes Luis Guzmבn, Jaimie Alexander and Johnny Knoxville. At 65, Mr. Schwarzenegger can no longer be expected to do it all.
Here he plays the sheriff of a small town on the Mexico border, an ill-fitting role. Sorry, big guy, but making small talk with the locals at the diner just isn't you.
The sheriff and his deputies have to stop a drug lord who has engineered a particularly improbable escape from custody and is headed for the border in a supercharged Corvette. The South Korean director Kim Jee-woon fails to dazzle with the endless speeding-car sequences, but that 60-second flourish during a lengthy firefight is almost worth the tedium.
''The Last Stand'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for blood, violence and unsafe driving.
Opens on Friday nationwide. Directed by Kim Jee-woon 1 hour 47 minutes

The States Confront Gun Violence

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; EDITORIAL | THE GUN CHALLENGE; Pg. 26

LENGTH: 721 words

State lawmakers in Wyoming didn't need to hear President Obama's gun-control proposals on Wednesday in order to attack them. A week ago, before the White House had even decided what actions to take, Republicans introduced a bill in the Wyoming Legislature to block any federal limitation on firearms, such as an assault weapons ban. A federal agent seeking to enforce such a ban would be guilty of a felony and face five years in prison.
This ludicrous bill would be laughable if the idea weren't spreading. A similar bill filed in Tennessee would also make federal gun enforcement a state crime, though it's more ''moderate'' than Wyoming's: federal agents doing their jobs would be charged only with Class A misdemeanors. Inevitably, a bill like Wyoming's has been filed in Texas. And, in Mississippi, Gov. Phil Bryant announced that the state would block federal gun measures. A proposed law in the state would claim that Washington has no jurisdiction over weapons made in Mississippi. 
There's no point in telling these fanatics that federal gun restrictions are completely constitutional, even under the Supreme Court's latest interpretation of the Second Amendment, or that federal law pre-empts state law. They already know these bills will be unenforceable. They are merely legislative fist-shaking, letting pro-gun voters know that lawmakers share their antipathy to the Obama administration, and signaling to the National Rifle Association and other gun-manufacturing lobbies that they are worthy recipients of rich political contributions.
Already, states like these have done enormous damage to public safety by acceding to the N.R.A.'s demands for laws that are anything but symbolic. The gun lobby hasn't been content with the ability of Americans to lawfully possess hundreds of millions of handguns and assault rifles. It wants gun owners to be able to carry these weapons anywhere they want, even among children, concealed or displayed, and preferably without the annoyance of permits, background checks, or safety precautions.
After the Virginia Tech massacre in 2007, the N.R.A. defied logic and pushed a bill to allow guns on college campuses. Thanks to help from the American Legislative Exchange Council, the conservative organization of state lawmakers to which the N.R.A. has contributed heavily, five states now allow campus guns. Only nine states prohibit guns at sporting events, and just 26 prohibit them where alcohol is served.
Wisconsin actually allows guns in the public gallery that looks down on the state assembly, and the N.R.A. pressured lawmakers last week to keep it that way. The N.R.A. and the American Legislative Exchange Council were behind the ''stand your ground'' laws that allow people to shoot others if they believe they are in danger, which has led to hundreds of deaths while allowing killers to walk free.
State gun laws matter. Of the 10 states with the most restrictive laws, seven also have the lowest gun death rates, according to a study by the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Similarly, lax gun laws correlate to a high level of gun deaths.
That's why it's good to see several states step up to their responsibilities to prevent violence instead of following the southern and western states that appear to be encouraging it. New York was out front this week in passing a ban on assault weapons and large-capacity magazines, among other measures. A similar ban is moving ahead in Illinois. New Jersey and Connecticut are moving more slowly, appointing task forces to make recommendations, but are at least heading in the right direction.
California is considering legislation that would limit sales of ammunition, requiring background checks and permits for bullet buyers. Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado, the site of so much carnage, has reversed his opposition to new restrictions, proposing universal background checks as well as an overhaul of the state mental health system to identify those who should be kept away from weapons.
Still, too many states continue to put their citizens at risk as they pledge ever-greater fealty to the gun manufacturers. It's time the states became laboratories for safety rather than violence.
This is part of a continuing series on the epidemic of gun violence and possible solutions. Other editorials are at nytimes.com/gunchallenge.

P. Gallinari, A Terrorist, Is Dead at 62

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Obituary; Pg. 25

LENGTH: 661 words

Prospero Gallinari, who as a member of the Italian terrorist group the Red Brigades was convicted in the kidnapping and assassination in 1978 of Aldo Moro, the Italian prime minister, died Monday after collapsing at his home in Reggio Emilia, in northern Italy. He was 62. He was long believed to have been the gunman in the killing until a comrade took responsibility.
Mr. Gallinari had a history of heart trouble, Italian newspapers said, citing police reports confirming his death. 
The Red Brigades, a vicious and idiosyncratic Marxist-Leninist paramilitary organization, engaged in robberies, assaults and assassinations in the 1970s as part of a campaign to foment leftist revolution in Italy. The group's most notorious act was kidnapping Mr. Moro in March 1978. It held him for 55 days and then shot him to death. Mr. Moro's body was found in a car trunk on May 9, 1978, the same day he was murdered.
Mr. Gallinari was convicted of killing the prime minister with a pistol shot followed by a burst of fire from a submachine gun. He accepted responsibility for the killing as a member of the Red Brigades, but in 1993 Mario Moretti, a higher-ranking member of the group, said that he, not Mr. Gallinari, was in fact the killer. ''I would not have allowed anyone else to do it,'' Mr. Moretti said in a jailhouse interview.
Another group member, Adriana Faranda, was also quoted as saying that Mr. Gallinari was not the killer. He had even said goodbye to Mr. Moro and cried, she said, according to ANSA, the Italian news agency.
Prospero Gallinari was born in Reggio Emilia on Jan. 1, 1951. His parents were sharecroppers. His devotion to leftist causes began when he was 9, he said, after he attended a funeral for people killed in clashes between landowners and the police. At a young age he joined the Communist youth federation and remained with it until the late 1960s.
He then joined the Superclan, an ultrasecret leftist group (the name stands for ''super clandestine'') that specialized in armed robberies. He became a full member of the Red Brigades around 1973. Modeling itself after urban guerrilla groups in Latin America, the Brigades hoped to destabilize Italy through sabotage, bank robberies, kidnappings and murder. Its members were known to cripple people by shooting them in the kneecaps.
In 1974, Mr. Gallinari participated in the abduction and mock trial of Mario Sossi, a prosecutor. Convicted of the kidnapping, Mr. Gallinari escaped from a prison in Treviso in 1976. Two years later, on a Rome street, he was one of four armed terrorists who jumped out of bushes, automatic pistols blazing, to capture Mr. Moro. They killed his five guards.
In September 1979, Mr. Gallinari was arrested while changing license plates on a stolen car, apparently in preparation for a terrorist action. Four years later, he and 31 other members of the Red Brigades were sentenced to life in prison for the Moro kidnapping and murder and other crimes.
In a statement to the court, Mr. Gallinari said the terrorists had engineered the kidnapping to shatter an emerging alliance between Mr. Moro's conservatives and the Communists. The Brigades saw the deal as a sellout by the Communists. The group had hoped to exchange Mr. Moro for imprisoned terrorists, but the government refused to negotiate.
In 1987, Mr. Gallinari and four others from the Red Brigades were caught trying to dig a tunnel to escape prison. Using just spoons and sticks, they had gone nearly 20 yards. Mr. Gallinari was released in 1996 because of his heart disease, and had been on probation ever since.
Mr. Gallinari later helped write a scene for a play about the kidnapping that opened in 1998 at a theater in Parma, Italy. In 2006, he published an autobiography, ''A Farmer in the Metropolis.'' Information on survivors was not available.
The Italian authorities decimated the Red Brigades in the 1980s, partly by offering prisoners earlier release in return for testimony against their comrades.

7-Year-Old Takes Gun To School

BYLINE: By WENDY RUDERMAN and CHRISTOPHER MAAG; Marc Santora and Jack Styczynski contributed reporting.

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 19

A handgun was found in the backpack of a 7-year-old student at a public elementary school in Queens on Thursday morning, New York City officials said, leading to a tense few hours as the school was placed on lockdown while the police made sure there was no danger.
It remained unclear how the gun, a .22-caliber semiautomatic pistol, ended up in the boy's backpack. The police said that a magazine, separated from the pistol but loaded with 10 bullets, and a plastic bag with 7 to 10 additional rounds of ammunition were also found in the boy's bag. Officials had yet to determine whether there was a bullet in the gun's chamber, Paul J. Browne, the Police Department's chief spokesman, said on Thursday, but the weapon was not fired. 
''The question of whether the child saw'' the gun and ammunition ''and put it in his backpack, or an older brother hid it there, is still under investigation,'' Mr. Browne said.
The boy, a second grader, arrived at Wave Preparatory Elementary School in Far Rockaway about 7:30 a.m. About two hours later, the boy's mother learned that he had the gun and she raced to the school. She told administrators that she needed to take him out of school for a dentist appointment, Mr. Browne said.
''Initially, it would appear that her intention was just to get the gun back and get it out of the school,'' Mr. Browne said.
But after the mother asked her son if he had a gun in his bag, he told her that he had given the weapon to a classmate, prompting her to alert the principal. The school was placed on lockdown just after 10 a.m., Mr. Browne said.
Two school safety officers assigned to Wave Preparatory went to a second-floor classroom and found the other student. Upon searching his bag, the officers found a flare gun, but not the .22-caliber pistol, which they discovered moments later in the first child's backpack, along with the ammunition and loaded gun clip, Mr. Browne said. The police believe that the flare gun, which was unloaded, may also have come from the first boy's home.
Investigators were trying to determine exactly how the pistol ended up in the boy's backpack and how his mother learned it was there. Mr. Browne said that whether the boy's mother would face charges was ''still under review.''
The boy has two older half brothers, ages 21 and 27, Mr. Browne said.
On Thursday night, two police officers stood at the top of the stairs inside an apartment building, listed as the mother's address, above a barbershop on Cornaga Avenue.
Earlier in the day, students at Wave Preparatory described a nervous few hours that began when the principal went on the intercom to say that the school was being locked down and that they were to remain in their classrooms.
''I thought we were going to get killed,'' said Javier Ferrufino, an 11-year-old in fifth grade. ''We went to the back of the classroom. I hid with my friend behind some computers.''
Officials at the school declined to comment.
The city's Education Department released a statement confirming that a gun had been found and that the school had been locked down.
When parents arrived in the afternoon to pick up their children, more than a dozen police officers were at the school.
A notice given to parents said: ''Due to an incident today there was need to secure all students in their classrooms. This procedure is called a lockdown. Our school-based support team is prepared to assist you with any emotional needs as a result of today's lockdown.''
Giovanni Dennis, an 8-year-old third grader, said he hid under his teacher's desk after the principal announced the lockdown. His mother, Cecelia Dennis, said she was upset that she did not know about the lockdown until she arrived to get Giovanni. ''I think they did a good job of locking down the school,'' she said. ''But they could have notified the parents earlier.''
Lawrence Clark, 49, went to pick up his stepdaughter Shakyla Howard, 8, at 4:15. ''I live 30 seconds from the school, and I just found out about this five minutes ago from my brother-in-law's Facebook page. And he lives in Utica,'' Mr. Clark said. ''This school sends out texts and e-mails about all this stupid stuff, like parent-teacher conferences. But I didn't find out about this until just now?''
Shakyla said: ''They made us turn off the lights and hide behind the teacher's desk. I almost cried. I was afraid we were going to get shot.''

Robert H. Levenson, a Visionary Adman, Dies at 83

BYLINE: By MARGALIT FOX

SECTION: Section ; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 

LENGTH: 778 words

Robert H. Levenson, an advertising executive who helped produce some of the mid-20th century's most memorable campaigns, writing evocative advertisements for clients like Volkswagen, El Al and Sara Lee, died on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 83.
The cause was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, said his wife, Jane Warshaw. 
Mr. Levenson was associated for more than a quarter-century with the New York agency Doyle Dane Bernbach. He became the agency's creative director in 1970 and was later a vice chairman and the chairman of its international operation.
He had joined DDB as a copywriter in 1959 and soon became known for his pithy, genially colloquial ad lines.
''He called it a 'Gertrude Steiny' way of writing: very crisp and to the point,'' said Dominik Imseng, a Swiss copywriter and author whose 2011 book, ''Think Small,'' chronicles the history of that campaign, done by DDB for Volkswagen. (Mr. Levenson did not create that campaign, though he did work on a later incarnation of it.)
At DDB, Mr. Levenson collaborated with art directors including Len Sirowitz and especially Helmut Krone to produce a string of ad lines from the 1960s that have endured in the public memory.
For Volkswagen of America, Mr. Levenson created several print ads that centered on the Beetle's diminutive size, solid craftsmanship and fuel efficiency. They include the tag lines ''It makes your house look bigger'' and ''After we paint the car, we paint the paint.''
He also devised a New Yorker-style cartoon, produced amid rising gasoline prices, that showed a man holding the nozzle of a gas pump to his temple as if it were a gun. The caption: ''Or buy a Volkswagen.''
For El Al, Mr. Levenson wrote a series of print ads that drew on the warmth of Jewish oral tradition. (The New York City schoolteacher-turned-comedian Sam Levenson was his uncle.) His tag lines for the company included ''My son, the pilot'' and ''We don't take off until everything is kosher.''
For Sara Lee, he wrote the words to the durable TV jingle ''Everybody doesn't like something/ But nobody doesn't like Sara Lee,'' which accompanied shots of people enduring all manner of irritants (haircuts, traffic jams) before consoling themselves with a piece of the company's cake.
Mr. Levenson was especially proud, his wife said, of a series of ads for Mobil, centering on highway safety and collectively titled ''We Want You to Live.''
His entries in that campaign include a print ad featuring a photo of a man driving while embracing a young woman above the headline, ''Till Death Us Do Part.'' For a starkly effective television spot, Mr. Levenson and Mr. Sirowitz showed a car being pushed off the roof of a 10-story building.
''If you drive at 60 miles an hour and hit something, it's exactly the same as driving off a 10-story building,'' the narrator says. The voice-over continues, as the camera shows the car landing, crumpled: ''And it will get you to exactly the same place ... the morgue.''
Robert Harold Levenson was born in New York City on Nov. 23, 1929, and raised in the Bronx. He earned bachelor's and master's degrees in English from New York University and afterward worked at various jobs, including market research, before joining DDB.
He first made his mark at the agency in 1960, as the author of a house ad for DDB that appeared in Time magazine. The ad had been the winning entry in a contest, sponsored by Time, that invited various agencies to submit ads that best reflected their corporate philosophies.
Mr. Levenson's ad was boldly headlined ''Do This or Die.'' In the text that followed, he wrote: ''Is this ad some kind of trick? No. But it could have been.'' The ad, still considered canonical, ends with a meditation on the need for truth in advertising.
Mr. Levenson was inducted into the Copywriters Hall of Fame (now the Creative Hall of Fame) in 1972. After leaving DDB in 1985, he held executive positions at Saatchi & Saatchi and at Scali, McCabe, Sloves.
Mr. Levenson's first marriage, to Elaine Berk, ended in divorce; his second wife, Kathe Tanous, died before him. Besides Ms. Warshaw, whom he married last April, he is survived by two sons from his first marriage, Keith and Seth; a stepdaughter, Katherine Warshaw-Reid; and a step-granddaughter.
In interviews over the years, Mr. Levenson elucidated his philosophy of copywriting, which was, at bottom, epistolary.
''When he was asked how he wrote the copy for all those Volkswagen ads,'' Mr. Imseng recalled on Thursday, ''he said: 'I always started by writing Dear Charlie, like writing to a friend. And then I would say what I had to say, and at the end I would cross out Dear Charlie, and I was all right.' ''

An Outsize Personality Joins, And Jostles, the Mayor's Race

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO and MATT FLEGENHEIMER

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 1623 words

To pump himself up for tense negotiations with the City Council, Joseph J. Lhota listened to the soaring theme song to the film ''Top Gun,'' and, afterward, relaxed to the soothing tones of Gregorian chants.
Dispensing with diplomacy, he loudly challenged a 77-year-old Holocaust survivor to ''be a man'' at a public meeting of the region's transit authority, and he once gave the middle finger to a reporter in the rotunda of City Hall.
And, acting on instinct, he raced into the streets of Lower Manhattan on Sept. 11, 2001, to direct traffic and then, at day's end, delivered a copy of a Winston Churchill biography to his boss, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, for inspiration.
In a city whose once raucous and colorful politics have become remarkably button-down and tranquil over the past decade, Mr. Lhota, who filed documents on Thursday to become a Republican candidate for mayor, is something of a throwback: an unapologetically outsize personality, known throughout his career for big emotions and an uninhibited style. 
His combination of experience -- on Wall Street, in the Giuliani administration and, most recently, running the Metropolitan Transportation Authority -- differs significantly from the backgrounds of the Democratic elected officials who have so far dominated the 2013 campaign, changing the character of the race.
But above all, Mr. Lhota's candidacy presents a question: Is the New York that elected Michael R. Bloomberg, a relatively measured, data-adoring technocrat, ready to embrace a larger than life, occasionally profane figure reminiscent of a more theatrical era in the city's politics -- a man who as a deputy mayor once paused in the middle of a closely watched legal deposition to quote Aristotle and playfully contemplate the derivation of the word ''ejectment'' (''a new word form, when I first heard it,'' he told his interrogators).
Lhota advisers say his candor and authenticity are his disarming charm, distinguishing him from a field made up of candidates they see as predictable political players.
Asked in an interview on Thursday about his flashes of hotheadedness, Mr. Lhota replied, ''You forgot my humor.''
''People should be respected for the strength of their convictions,'' he added. ''And I also believe in freedom of expression. It is what it is.''
Personality aside, even Mr. Lhota's supporters acknowledge that his challenges are daunting. He is largely unknown, and his party is vastly outnumbered: for every registered Republican in the city, there are six Democrats.
His most significant credentials are also his biggest liabilities. The transit authority is a lifeline that New Yorkers love to hate, and Mr. Giuliani remains a polarizing figure in the city, especially with nonwhite voters.
Mr. Lhota said he was proud of his work with Mr. Giuliani. ''I cannot be separated from Rudy Giuliani,'' he said. ''But I am also not Rudy Giuliani.''
He described himself as a ''practical Republican,'' determined to control spending and resist giveaways to public unions, even as he supports abortion rights and same-sex marriage. He described himself as a hunter who grew up around guns, but, he said, ''there is no reason for anybody to have an assault weapon.''
He declared that New York voters do not vote based on party labels -- no Democrat has won a mayoral race in 24 years -- and seemed to take pains to project a nonpartisan streak. He wore a bright purple tie and conducted the interview inside the Roosevelt House, on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, where he said Franklin D. Roosevelt had formulated his thinking about what would become the New Deal.
Mr. Lhota allowed that he had voted for several Democrats over the years, including Andrew M. Cuomo in his 2010 run for governor, but he did little to hide his reservations about President Obama. ''Let's get it all out of the way,'' he said. ''I have voted for a Republican for president ever since I was voting and since I was 18 years old.''
Mr. Lhota, 58, who lives in Brooklyn Heights, has a biography that seems ready-made for a mayoral race: his father was a New York police lieutenant, his grandfathers a New York firefighter and a taxi driver. In conversations, he wields an encyclopedic knowledge of New York history, architecture and politics.
After graduating from Georgetown and Harvard Business School, he became a leader in the fast-growing Wall Street business of municipal finance.
Like many young conservatives frustrated by the city's problems with crime and homelessness in the 1980s, he was drawn to Mr. Giuliani's tough-talking message of reform.
Mr. Lhota began showing up for weekly tutorial sessions -- quickly called ''mayor university'' -- for Mr. Giuliani, then a United States attorney.
When Mr. Giuliani was elected mayor in 1993, he persuaded Mr. Lhota to join him at City Hall as an assistant in the economic development office, where Mr. Lhota's rise was rapid, even by city government standards. By Mr. Giuliani's second term, Mr. Lhota was deputy mayor for operations, overseeing three-fourths of the city's work force and standing in as mayor when Mr. Giuliani was out of town.
Mr. Lhota was an influential figure in many of Mr. Giuliani's signature pushes -- a huge reduction in the city's welfare rolls; the closing of Fresh Kills on Staten Island, the last landfill in the city; and a hard-nosed style of budgeting that sought to deprive the Council of coveted dollars it had long relied on.
Mr. Lhota, working with Mr. Giuliani, pushed for drastic reductions in mainstays, like financing for the arts, knowing well that council members would demand their return. The resulting fury would be calmed by the return of basic financing, but often little else.
''Joe was the person who helped formulate that strategy,'' Mr. Giuliani said. ''Joe knew the inner secret.'' He was, however, the rare Giuliani loyalist liked by the mayor's enemies.
Ronnie Eldridge, who represented the Upper West Side on the Council from 1989 to 2001, said Mr. Lhota was an uncommon ally in a truculent City Hall that, she recalled, once halted construction on a project she had championed because her husband, the newspaper columnist Jimmy Breslin, had criticized Mr. Giuliani's plans to overhaul Times Square.
''I had a terrible relationship with the Giuliani administration,'' she said in a telephone interview. ''But not with Joe, ever. He was respectful, he was responsive and funny, and willing to at least give you the impression that he was agreeing with you.''
After leaving City Hall at the end of the Giuliani term, Mr. Lhota re-entered the corporate world, as a top executive at Cablevision and Madison Square Garden.
His return to public service, at the transportation authority in 2011, became the unexpected platform for a mayoral run. Under his supervision, the subway system made a rapid recovery after Hurricane Sandy, hastened by a prescient decision to shut down the system before the storm.
But Mr. Lhota, who resigned as the authority's chairman last month, also left it with an unresolved labor contract and a major downtown subway station still shuttered from the hurricane.
''The irony is, he didn't lift a finger to put the system back together,'' said John Samuelsen, president of Transport Workers Union Local 100. ''He didn't settle the contract with us, and now, off the work that we did, he's trying to launch a mayoral candidacy.''
What voters may remember, though, is the looming subway and bus fare increase passed under his watch, raising rates by a quarter, to $2.50. Advisers to a presumptive rival, Christine C. Quinn, the Council speaker, call it the ''Lhota fare hike.''
But Mr. Lhota had pointed words of his own for Ms. Quinn on Thursday, when she was described as his fiercest competitor. ''I thought you would say Billy Thompson,'' he said, referring to a former city comptroller.
He minimized Ms. Quinn's experience and her role in government: ''Understanding the legislative side of how it operates is just one small area of what's necessary for a chief executive.''
Over the past year, Mr. Lhota has endeared himself to a wider audience with an active and frequently impolitic Twitter account, where he offered unguarded commentary on sports, politics and his own alcohol consumption (''Too much wine,'' he posted apologetically).
In his original Twitter profile, he described himself as a ''9/11 cancer survivor,'' a subject he is not shy about discussing.
Shortly after he received a diagnosis of cancer in 2005, Mr. Lhota e-mailed friends with characteristic defiance and humor.
Anticipating hair loss from chemotherapy, he asked for ''ideas for temporary tattoos to slap on the side of my head.'' He asked for prayers, but made clear he had already turned, once again, to Churchill, for words of comfort.
''Never give in, never give in, never, never, never,'' he wrote, quoting his hero.
Mr. Lhota's cancer is in remission, and he says he is ready for the rigors of a mayoral run.

Twists and Turns in Becoming a Man: A Day in Baltimore

BYLINE: By A. O. SCOTT

SECTION: Section C; Column 0; Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk; MOVIE REVIEW; Pg. 8

LENGTH: 692 words

By his own account Vincent is a man who knows how to handle his business, and at first glance, you might take him for a conventional kind of businessman. His trim gray suit and chunky gold wristwatch go nicely with the black Mercedes-Benz sedan parked in front of his mother's modest Baltimore house. Vincent's young nephew, Woody, idolizes his uncle, drawing him, in a school notebook, as a fearless, muscle-bound superhero.
''Luv,'' the sensitive and surprising new movie directed by Sheldon Candis, follows Woody (the excellent 12-year-old actor Michael Rainey Jr.) and Vincent (Common) through a single eventful day, during which the masculine self-confidence that Woody worships and longs to emulate comes unraveled. Vincent decides to keep his nephew out of school and give him some lessons in how to be a man. 
In the hours that follow, the boy eats his first oyster, tastes his first beer, learns how to crack a steamed crab and how to steer a car, but he also encounters some of the ugly, violent aspects of manhood as embodied by his idol. Vincent turns out to be a desperate criminal, and if Woody is Vincent's eager protיgי, he also becomes an accomplice and, to some extent, a hostage.
Vincent has just returned home after serving 8 years of a 20-year sentence for an unspecified crime. His sister, Woody's mother, is away in North Carolina, and the boy copes with her absence by imagining that his uncle has the power to reunite the family. Vincent, though, is hardly in control of his own life. He wants to leave behind his old ways and open a seafood restaurant, but he is still tied up with a lot of very dangerous characters, some of whom want him dead.
Mr. Candis, who wrote the script with Justin Wilson, balances the more sensationalistic aspects of the movie -- guns are pointed and fired, blood is shed, and threats are issued with heavy, macho menace -- with keen attention to details of character and place. The landscape of Baltimore's African-American neighborhoods may be familiar to fans of ''The Wire'' (as will the faces of a few of the actors), but ''Luv'' is telling a different kind of tale about drugs, the law and urban life. It is, as the title suggests, a love story, focused on the complicated bonds between men who regard one another as family and whose lives are scarred and shadowed by violence.
The plot tests the limits of realism in ways that are sometimes interesting and sometimes unconvincing. The everything-in-one-day drama is an inherently risky form, and the best thing Mr. Candis does is slow down the action to linger over small, intimate moments. Common, who mastered a disciplined, self-possessed swagger in his career as a rapper, has the acting skills to suggest the emotional turmoil beneath Vincent's cool, always-in-control demeanor. This man was, after all, once a boy like Woody, a point emphasized by the presence of his own erstwhile mentors, in particular a crime boss played with smooth, unnervingly sympathetic authority by Dennis Haysbert.
The cast also includes Danny Glover and Charles S. Dutton, who bring warmth as well as menace and who bolster the film's determination to avoid clichיs about The Streets. It does not entirely succeed, but at its best ''Luv'' shows the kind of heart and intelligence that is always welcome -- and often missing -- in American movies.
''Luv'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Gun violence and strong language.
Luv

Where Dread Throbs And Little Girls Scuttle

BYLINE: By MANOHLA DARGIS

SECTION: Section C; Column 0; Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk; MOVIE REVIEW; Pg. 6

LENGTH: 824 words

Guillermo del Toro, the reigning godfather of motion-picture horror, is the modern-day Val Lewton, the legendary producer of atmospheric chillers like ''The Curse of the Cat People.'' If you're a movie fan, you know that horror doesn't get much better than this, and when it comes to contemporary offerings it rarely gets more enjoyable than ''Mama.'' Instead of delivering buckets of guts and gore, this ghost story offers a strong sense of time and place, along with the kind of niceties that don't often figure into horror flicks, notably pictorial beauty, an atmosphere throbbing with dread and actors so good that you don't want anyone to take an ax to them. 
The story opens with a camera sliding up to a car parked at an angle, with the driver's door open and the radio blaring in front of a suburban house. Catastrophic economic news has led to a panic, with one executive, Jeffrey (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau), running amok. Since the fetching Mr. Coster-Waldau plays the blond bad boy Jaime Lannister on HBO's ''Game of Thrones,'' you may expect the worst. The director Andy Muschietti -- who shares script credit with his sister, Barbara (who's also one of the producers), and a third writer, Neil Cross -- whittles the story down to its freaky primal nub. One minute, Jeffrey is holding a gun and contemplating the unthinkable with his two young daughters; the next, the girls are five years older and singing a lullaby straight out of ''Hellraiser.''
The Muschiettis open the movie with ''once upon a time,'' tipping that ''Mama'' is a modern fairy tale of sorts. After the girls went missing with their father, their uncle, Lucas (also Mr. Coster-Waldau), initiated a search. Two of his trackers find them in a derelict midcentury-modern home deep in the woods. (Dad remains M.I.A.) It's a setting that suggests an abandoned Don Draper weekend getaway, save for the two critters scuttling across the floors and atop a fridge, where one hovers over the other like a bird with a chick. Filthy, with matted hair and skinny spider legs, these are the little lost girls, Victoria (Megan Charpentier), and her younger sister, Lilly (Isabelle Nיlisse), wild children seemingly headed toward an unhappily ever after.
Lucas takes custody of Victoria and Lilly, to the sullen displeasure of his live-in girlfriend, Annabel (Jessica Chastain). Together they move into a house provided by the hospital where the girls are treated. However appealing its cast, the movie sputters in this stretch, partly because it takes time to recover from the shock of Ms. Chastain's amusingly apt Goth drag (she only looks menacing), with her jet-black accouterments and multiple tattoos snaking around her pale arms. More problematic are the lapses in logic. The filmmakers easily sweep the girls out of their woodland digs, but they stumble with some of the more ordinary scenes.
''Mama'' began as a wittily unnerving three-minute short about two girls and a maternal creature that the Muschiettis shot to show Mr. Muschietti's range as a director. Mr. del Toro took notice of their pocket shocker, and while he took only an executive producing credit on the feature-length ''Mama,'' it fits with the more successful movies he's signed onto. Mr. del Toro understands that nothing says terror like a home that's become a rattling cage. And so, once Lucas has been awkwardly dispatched, leaving Annabel home alone with the girls, Mr. Muschietti gets down to shivery business.
Ms. Chastain and her excellent child co-stars, an intensely matched set, embody their characters with soulful believability, whether they're working together or creeping along a hallway solo. Left to their own devices these three initially circle one another warily. Where this reluctant, plausibly uneasy family is headed is obvious, but Mr. Muschietti throws out enough diversions and visual wit to keep you distracted from the predictable turns. In ''Mama'' horror is intimate, domestic and overtly feminized, so much so that its monster -- Javier Botet, from the ''(Rec)'' Franchise -- opens up darkly oozing, Cronenbergian holes in the wall, a striking visual suggesting that the house itself has given birth to the demon. Here the law of the father meets the wounded wrath of the mother.
''Mama'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). A consistent sense of dread, topped with some dead.

Recalling Pain Of Guns' Toll, Mayors Urge Bills' Passage

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 14

LENGTH: 818 words

WASHINGTON -- Some mayors spoke about the bad feeling they got with each call that there had been another shooting in their city. Others described the pain of burying police officers who had worked for them. Many recalled their attempts to console grieving families.
So as mayors from around the nation gathered here on Thursday for the 81st winter meeting of the United States Conference of Mayors, many said they were heartened by President Obama's call for new laws to curb gun violence, which included several measures that the conference had sought for decades. Many said they planned to urge Congress to enact them. 
''Far too often it is the mayor who gets the call about a tragic crime committed with an illegal gun that's resulted in a loss of life,'' Mayor Michael Nutter of Philadelphia, the president of the conference, said in a speech. ''It may be the life of a child. A police officer. A young black man. A young woman. It could be anyone in our cities. But it's the mayor who visits the family members who have had their hearts torn out, and the mayor who attends funeral after funeral after funeral.''
Mayor Ron Littlefield of Chattanooga, Tenn., recalled a police officer who was shot to death while responding to a robbery at a pawnshop. Mayor Sly James of Kansas City, Mo., lamented what he called the ''slow-motion mass murder'' that claims the lives of more than 100 young people in his city each year. And Mayor R. T. Rybak of Minneapolis said he had ''heard too many eulogies for amazing people whom I will never know.''
The mayors gave a standing ovation to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who praised the work they had done over the years on gun issues and urged them to push for the passage of the president's proposals.
''There are some who say the most powerful voice in this debate belongs to the gun lobby and those who demand a stop to these common-sense approaches to save lives,'' Mr. Biden told the Conference of Mayors. ''I think they're wrong.''
''Newtown has shocked the nation,'' the vice president said. ''The carnage on our streets is no longer able to be ignored. We're going to take this fight to the halls of Congress. We're going to take it beyond that. We're going to take it to the American people.''
Many mayors said they were eager at the prospect that new gun laws might pass.
Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. of Charleston, S.C., who has been in office for more than three decades, said he hoped that the country would ''seize this moment.''
''I know that no police officer wants to be confronted with an assault weapon,'' he said. ''They would be out-ammoed. And I think that it's time for our country to deal with this, it's time for Congress to deal with this.''
But even here, at a meeting of a group that has advocated stricter gun laws for decades, there was not unanimity. Mayor Mick Cornett of Oklahoma City, a Republican, said he did not believe that the gun control proposals being discussed would ''resolve the problem they're trying to resolve.''
''There are larger issues out there, and more specific issues, and I really would like to see us get a better handle on mental health,'' he said. ''I think the way that has trended in the last 10 years, the way that filters out into our jails and types of violence like this needs to be addressed. I wish they'd concentrate on that.''
One thing the mayors who are seeking new gun laws seem to lack is a high-profile sitting Republican mayor who agrees with them -- the way, say, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani became an influential voice in the debate in the early 1990s when he expressed his support for an assault weapons ban. (Mr. Giuliani reiterated his support for such a ban in an interview this month on NY1, the New York cable news channel.)
But some Republican mayors from smaller cities support tighter gun laws. Mayor Richard Ward of Hurst, Tex., a Republican, came here to lobby Congress with Mayors Against Illegal Guns, an advocacy group led by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York and Mayor Thomas M. Menino of Boston.
Mr. Ward, a gun owner who said he enjoyed ''blasting away'' at targets, said that after he joined the group, he got more than 100 letters from constituents who belonged to the National Rifle Association urging him to leave it.
''The next election I got 90 percent of the vote,'' he said, chuckling. ''After that I got 86 percent -- they're gaining on me!''
Mr. Rybak, the Minneapolis mayor, suggested that his counterparts, who buy thousands of guns to arm their police departments, should use their clout with the gun industry.
''We buy a boatload of guns in this country,'' he said Wednesday at a news conference called by Mayors Against Illegal Guns. ''If the gun lobby comes here to Congress and starts throwing their weight around about what's going to happen with guns, well, the mayors of America are going to stand up: we buy a lot more guns than almost anybody in this country.''

Massacre Sways Public In Way Others Did Not

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER and DALIA SUSSMAN; Marjorie Connelly, Megan Thee-Brenan and Marina Stefan contributed reporting.

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 16

LENGTH: 953 words

The massacre of children at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., appears to be profoundly swaying Americans' views on guns, galvanizing the broadest support for stricter gun laws in about a decade, according to a New York Times/CBS News poll.
As President Obama tries to persuade a reluctant Congress to pass new gun laws, the poll found that a majority of Americans -- 54 percent -- think gun control laws should be tightened, up markedly from a CBS News poll last April that found that only 39 percent backed stricter laws. 
The rise in support for stricter gun laws stretched across political lines, including an 18-point increase among Republicans. A majority of independents now back stricter gun laws.
Whether the Newtown shooting -- in which 20 first graders and 6 adults were killed -- will have a long-term effect on public opinion of gun laws is hard to assess just a month after the rampage. But unlike the smaller increases in support for gun control immediately after other mass shootings, including after the 2011 shooting in Tucson that severely wounded Representative Gabrielle Giffords, the latest polling results suggest a deeper, and possibly more resonating, shift.
In terms of specific gun proposals being considered, the poll found even wider support, including among gun owners.
The idea of requiring background checks on all gun purchases, which would eliminate a provision that allows about 40 percent of guns to be sold by unlicensed sellers without checks, was overwhelmingly popular. Nine in 10 Americans would favor such a law, the poll found -- including 9 in 10 of the respondents who said that there was a gun in their household, and 85 percent whose households include National Rifle Association members.
A ban on high-capacity magazines, like the 15- and 30-round magazines that have been used in several recent mass shootings, was supported by more than 6 in 10, and by a majority of those who live in households with guns. And just over half of all respondents, 53 percent, said they would support a ban on some semiautomatic weapons.
After the mass shootings at Virginia Tech in 2007 and Tucson in 2011, polls found that 47 percent of Americans favored stricter gun laws.
''I'm from a rural area in the South, I grew up in a gun culture, my father hunted,'' Leslie Hodges, a 64-year-old graphic artist who lives in Atlanta and has a gun, said in a follow-up interview. ''However, I don't believe being able to have a gun keeps you from thinking reasonably about changes that would keep someone from walking into a school and being able to kill 20 children in 20 seconds. I think that we can say, O.K., we want the freedom to have guns in this country, but there are rules we can all agree to that will make us all safer.''
The poll also gave an indication of the state of play in Washington at the outset of what is expected to be a fierce debate over the nation's gun laws, as the National Rifle Association and several members of Congress, particularly Republicans in the House, have criticized the gun control measures that Mr. Obama proposed Wednesday and have vowed to block them.
Americans said that they trusted the president over Republicans in Congress to make the right decisions about gun laws by a margin of 47 percent to 39 percent, the poll found.
The National Rifle Association, the powerful gun lobby, is viewed favorably by nearly 4 in 10 Americans, the poll found. All told, 38 percent said that they had a favorable opinion of the group, while 29 percent had a negative view and the rest had no opinion. The N.R.A. was viewed positively by 54 percent of those with guns in their homes.
But the group is deeply unpopular with people in households without guns, who were twice as likely to have a negative view of the N.R.A. as a positive one: 41 percent of them expressed a negative view of it, while only 20 percent expressed a positive one.
The survey underscored how common guns in America are: 47 percent of those surveyed said that they or someone in their household owned a gun, and 31 percent had close friends or relatives who did. The top reasons cited for owning guns were protection and hunting.
The national poll was conducted by land lines and cellphones from Jan. 11 to Jan. 15, before the president announced his proposals to curb gun violence. It surveyed 1,110 adults and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
Some gun owners, like Sally Brady, a 69-year-old retired teacher who lives in Amissville, Va., explained in follow-up interviews why they would support some restrictions on ammunition or more thorough background checks of all gun buyers.
''I see no reason for high-capacity magazines if you want to go hunting,'' said Mrs. Brady, an independent who owns a hunting rifle. ''The purpose of hunting is sport, and you don't need a whole big bunch of bullets to shoot a deer or a squirrel. If you're that poor of a shot, stay out of the woods.''
Despite the higher support for stricter gun laws, many Americans do not think the changes would be very effective at deterring violence. While most Americans, 53 percent, said stricter gun laws would help prevent gun violence, about a quarter said they would help a lot.
Other steps were seen as being potentially more effective. About three-quarters of those surveyed said that having more police officers or armed security guards would help prevent mass shootings in public places. And more than 8 in 10 said better mental health screening and treatment would help prevent gun violence.
Violence in popular culture is seen by a large majority of Americans, 75 percent, as contributing to gun violence in the United States, including about 4 in 10 who say it contributes a lot.

Mr. Hawke also plays the title character in this modern update, which traces the slide from success to self-destruction of a songwriter in 1990s New York. Brooks Ashmanskas, Vincent D'Onofrio and Zoe Kazan also star in the production, which features live performances of classic American songs. Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Collision' (in previews; opens on Tuesday) The prolific no-rules New York theater troupe the Amoralists return with this incendiary drama written by Lyle Kessler and directed by David Fofi. An incongruous bunch of intellectuals meet in a heartland college dormitory and embark on a dangerous quest to create order out of chaos. Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, between Perry and West 11th Streets, Greenwich Village, (866) 811-4111, collisiontheplay.com. (Rooney)
'The House of Von Macrame' (previews start on Tuesday; opens on Wednesday) It's not the stage musical adaptation of ''The Eyes of Laura Mars'' that some of us have secretly prayed for, but this ''pop horror fashion show'' sounds close enough. Originally seen as a serialized play at the Flea Theater, this musical follows a small-town girl who becomes muse to a flamboyant designer and is haunted by grisly visions of murdered models that are the handiwork of the Lipstick Killer. Matt Marks wrote the songs, with Joshua Conkel handling book duties. Bushwick Starr, 207 Starr Street, between Irving and Wyckoff Avenues, Brooklyn, (800) 836-3006, thebushwickstarr.org. (Rooney)
'The Jammer' (in previews; opens on Tuesday) Fresh out of the Yale School of Drama, Rolin Jones turned heads at the Atlantic in 2005 with his play ''The Intelligent Design of Jenny Chow.'' After several years devoted to his busy television writing career (''Weeds,'' ''Boardwalk Empire''), Mr. Jones returns to the stage with this contemporary urban fable set in the hard-boiled world of professional roller derby in 1950s New York. Jackson Gay directs a nine-member cast led by Patch Darragh. Atlantic Stage 2, 330 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Rooney)
'Totally Tubular Time Machine' (previews start on Saturday; opens on Feb. 9) Every time a new jukebox assembly appears, musical theater purists complain that the form is being dumbed down into elaborate karaoke. The creators of this show thumb their noses at such charges. This immersive experience allows audiences to time-travel through the 1980s and '90s and back to the present, joining the party of celebrity excess and pop mash-up. (Saturdays only) Culture Club, 20 West 39th Street, totallytubularnyc.com, (212) 921-1999. (Rooney)
'The Vandal' (previews start on Friday; opens on Jan. 31) Since wrapping up his sitcom role on ''The New Adventures of Old Christine,'' Hamish Linklater has impressed on New York stages in ''Seminar'' and ''School for Lies.'' He follows other actors who have recently ventured into playwriting, like Jesse Eisenberg, Zach Braff and Zoe Kazan, with this enigmatic encounter between a woman and a boy, who swap stories one cold night at a Kingston, N.Y., bus stop. Jim Simpson directs a cast that includes Zach Grenier, Deirdre O'Connell and Noah Robbins. Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 226-2407, theflea.org. (Rooney)
Broadway
'Annie' James Lapine's revival of the singing comic strip from 1977 is merely serviceable. But its smiley-faced mixture of hope and corn scratches an itch in a city recovering from a recession and a hurricane. Theatergoers may feel the urge both to mist up and throw up, but Lilla Crawford is a nigh irresistible Orphan Annie. With Katie Finneran and Anthony Warlow (2:25). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Ben Brantley)
'Evita' This just in: Eva Perףn is still dead. That, anyway, is on the evidence of Michael Grandage's unsmiling revival of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice's 1978 bio-musical, which feels about as warm-blooded as a gilded mummy. Elena Roger, Michael Cerveris and Ricky Martin are the stars of this earnest combination of requiem mass and history pageant (2:30). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, Manhattan, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
'The Heiress' Masterpiece Theater on Broadway. Moisיs Kaufman's revival of Ruth and Augustus Goetz's sturdy war horse, starring a one-note Jessica Chastain, is lovely to look at, easy to follow and -- aside from a vivid supporting performance from Judith Ivey -- about as full of real life as an Olde New York Christmas window in a department store (2:45).

&#x2605; 'The Mystery of Edwin Drood' A boisterous, well-cast revival of Rupert Holmes's Tony-winning 1986 musical, which gives the audience the chance to choose the identity of the killer of the titular hero. Chita Rivera lends an air of authentic glamour, Jim Norton is a cutup as the music-hall proprietor, and the young cast sings the lovely score with great skill (2:35). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, roundabouttheatre.org, (212) 719-1300. (Charles Isherwood)
'Newsies' This Disney musical -- adapted from the 1992 movie and inspired by the newsboy strike of 1899 -- markets Urchin Appeal with extra! extra! enthusiasm. Jeff Calhoun directs a cast of comely, if overgrown, ragamuffins. The largely interchangeable songs are by Alan Menken and Jack Feldman (2:20). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (866) 870-2717, newsiesthemusical.com. (Brantley)
'Nice Work if You Can Get It' Every now and then a bubble of pure, tickling charm rises from the artificial froth of this pastiche 1920s musical, directed by Kathleen Marshall and featuring songs by George and Ira Gershwin. But mostly the production, starring Matthew Broderick and Kelli O'Hara, registers as a shiny, dutiful trickle of gags and production numbers (2:30). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Once' This gentle musical, set in Dublin, about a love affair that never quite happens -- based on the 2006 movie -- inventively uses songs (by Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova) and dance to convey a beautiful shimmer of might-have-been regret. Staged by John Tiffany and Steven Hoggett (''Black Watch''), the production stars the immensely appealing Steve Kazee and Cristin Milioti (2:15). Bernard B.

'The Other Place' Laurie Metcalf gives a captivating, complicated performance in Sharr White's clever puzzle of a drama, portraying a woman grappling with sudden onset of a mysterious illness at the same time as her personal life -- disloyal husband (Daniel Stern), estranged daughter (Zoe Perry) -- threatens to implode. Joe Mantello's nimble direction ratchets up the suspense (1:10). Friedman Theater, 261 West 47th Street, Manhattan, (800) 432-7250, mtc-nyc.org. (Isherwood)
'Picnic' A torso stars in Sam Gold's stultifying revival of William Inge's time-yellowed 1953 play, set in lusty, dusty Kansas. The torso belongs to Sebastian Stan as a handsome drifter whose bare pecs and abs stir deep longings in lonely bosoms. Those being stirred include Maggie Grace, Elizabeth Marvel, Ellen Burstyn and the excellent Mare Winningham (2:05).

&#x2605; 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' Pam MacKinnon's shattering 50th-anniversary revival of Edward Albee's hair-raising drama of marital discord stars an electrifying Tracy Letts (of ''August: Osage County'' fame) as George and Amy Morton (ditto) as Martha, ably supported by Carrie Coon and Madison Dirks as the young couple they use as cannon fodder. Not to be missed (3:05). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com.

'Bare' Stafford Arima directs this tale of star-cross'd gay lovers in a Roman Catholic boarding school. While the boys try to keep their romance secret, the truth comes spilling out during a school production of ''Romeo and Juliet.'' Retooled significantly since its first incarnation in 2000, this emo musical has been updated to reflect attitudes toward homophobia and bullying in the ''It Gets Better'' era. But despite touching moments and a committed cast, the material is too painfully earnest and riddled with clichיs to connect with audiences not still mired in adolescence (2:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, baremusicalnyc.com. (Rooney)
'Cougar the Musical' Three older women find themselves attracted to younger men, two against their better judgment. The concept seems made for bus tours, but imagination, appealing numbers with original melodies and theme-transcending jokes lift this show well above the level of ''Menopause: The Musical'' and its ilk (1:30).

&#x2605; 'Forbidden Broadway: Alive and Kicking' Gerard Alessandrini's essential satirical cheat sheet to Broadway musicals returns after a three-year absence, packing polished brass knuckles. A precisionist cast of four provides vocal cartoons as evocative as Al Hirschfeld's caricatures. This show not only tickles but also pierces the Achilles' heels of the productions under scrutiny (1:40). At the 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Fried Chicken and Latkes' Rain Pryor, the daughter of the comedian Richard Pryor, stars in this effervescent solo show, which recounts her upbringing in a biracial household (her mother is Jewish) in Beverly Hills, Calif. Ms. Pryor, who sings and portrays a range of characters (including, poignantly, her father in a spot-on impression) is an ebullient performer with a robust singing voice. Her outsize personality is built for Broadway (1:30). Actor's Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Andy Webster)
'In Acting Shakespeare' What began as an homage to Ian McKellen's one-man show ''Acting Shakespeare'' has become a boisterous, agreeable and somewhat glib tale of acting Shakespeare. The eager-to-please James DeVita charts his progress from histrionics to honesty, interwoven with bits of Shakespeare biography and plenty of dog-eared soliloquies (1:45). Pearl Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 563-9261, pearltheatre.org. (Grode)
'Job' The professionally confrontational Thomas Bradshaw (''Burning'') revisits the Old Testament's most famously afflicted figure in this short, sharp and joltingly funny work, which lets us see a familiar tale through wise virgin eyes. Benjamin H. Kamine ably steers a bright young cast through Mr. Bradshaw's unsparingly graphic vision of heaven and earth (1:00). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 226-2407, theflea.org. (Brantley)
'Love in the Time of Cholera' Directed by Josי Zayas and performed by an efficient four-actor crew, Caridad Svich's adaptation of the Gabriel Garcםa Mבrquez novel is pleasing but lightweight.

(Claudia La Rocco)
'My Name Is Asher Lev' Aaron Posner's adaptation of Chaim Potok's novel feels like a well-made play from the era in which the story takes place -- the 1950s. Set in a Hasidic community in Brooklyn, this tale of an artistic prodigy has been directed with an attention to emotional nuance by Gordon Edelstein and features strong performances from its three-person cast: Ari Brand, Mark Nelson and Jenny Bacon (1:30).

&#x2605; 'Water by the Spoonful' Quiara Alegrםa Hudes's moving collage of lives in crisis, the 2012 winner of the Pulitzer Prize for drama, is the second part of a trilogy centering on the Ortiz family. Elliot (the fine Armando Riesco), a former Marine injured in Iraq, struggles with the loss of the aunt who raised him and a tempestuous reconnection with the ex-crack-addict mother who abandoned him (2:10).

&#x2605; 'Patti Issues' In his funny, tender coming-of-age monologue, Ben Rimalower traces the obsessive Patti LuPone fandom that provided him with an empowering role model. That inspiration proved perhaps most useful to Mr. Rimalower in processing the fallout after his father kicked down the closet door and bailed on the family. While on one hand, this is the story of many young gay men's propensity for diva worship, the tartly observed show goes further by exploring the wide-eyed experiences that result when the acolyte gets to interact with his idol (1:00).

Last Chance
&#x2605; 'The Freedom of the City' (closes on Sunday) The masterful contemporary Irish dramatist Brian Friel puts a human face on the Troubles in Northern Ireland with this stirring drama from 1973 about the shooting by British soldiers of three nonviolent civilian protesters at a march, which echoes the tragic events of Bloody Sunday the year before. Staged by Ciaran O'Reilly, this drama steadily tightens its grip, from its absorbing beginnings through to its shattering conclusion. The standout among the generally solid cast is Cara Seymour as a stubbornly optimistic housewife and mother of 11 children, living in two rooms with a useless husband and no running water (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737, irishrep.org. (Rooney)
'Glengarry Glen Ross' (closes on Sunday) The fight has gone out of the boys from David Mamet's 1984 Pulitzer Prize-winning drama of sharks in a small pond. In Daniel Sullivan's deflated production, which stars an extravagantly gesturing Al Pacino, it's as if all the competitive fierceness has been sucked from them by some cosmic super-vacuum cleaner. It also stars Bobby Cannavale as the hotshot Ricky Roma (1:40). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Golden Boy' (closes on Sunday) Bartlett Sher directs a superbly cast revival of Clifford Odets's 1937 drama about a young man (Seth Numrich) torn between a career as a boxer and his first love, the violin. It's a richly atmospheric production that cuts to the emotional quick of Odets's still-vital play (2:45). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
&#x2605; 'Grimly Handsome' (closes on Sunday) Weird urban wildlife, funny and expansive language, and three terrific actors: What's not to like about Julia Jarcho's latest play, which mucks around in the darkly rich underbelly of the city? The play, part of Incubator Arts Project's Other Forces festival, has no intermission (1:30).

'Hamlet, Prince of Grief' (closes on Sunday) The shortest ''Hamlet'' you'll probably ever see, presented as part of the Under the Radar festival: an Iranian production starring Afshin Hashemi and a suitcase full of plastic toys, in a 30-minute contemporary gloss on the Shakespeare tragedy (:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Isherwood)
'I, Malvolio' (closes on Sunday) Tim Crouch's solo show, which reimagines Shakespeare's ''Twelfth Night'' from the perspective of its most put-upon character, improbably finds the sweet (and sour) spot between comedy and self-subverting analysis. This British import skillfully takes its audience into a discomfort zone where laughter rings hollow. Unusually gutsy -- and thoughtful -- stuff for children's theater (1:00).

This gleeful hourlong exploration of Mary Shelley's novel and its descendants comes from Radiohole, the Brooklyn-based company that has dedicated itself to the proposition that art isn't tidy (1:00). This work is a Radiohole production, presented by Performance Space 122 and the Kitchen, as part of the Coil Festival.

&#x2605; 'Tribes' (closes on Sunday) Nina Raine's smart, lively and beautifully acted play asks us to hear how we hear, in silence as well as speech. This British import considers the passive and aggressive forms of listening within an insular, intellectual family, whose members include a deaf son. David Cromer is the expert director (2:15). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com. (Brantley)
'Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike' (closes on Sunday) Nomenclature would seem to be fate for the title characters of Christopher Durang's sunny comedy about gloomy people. David Hyde Pierce, Kristine Nielsen and Sigourney Weaver portray three siblings (if not three sisters) whose parents burdened them with Chekovian names. Nicholas Martin directs this surprisingly mild-mannered work from a savage satirist (2:30). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)

What Should Be Done About Guns?

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; LETTERS; Pg. 26

LENGTH: 954 words

To the Editor:
Re ''Obama to 'Put Everything I've Got' Into Gun Control'' (front page, Jan. 17): It has become fashionable of late to lament the unbridgeable divide over guns in our country. President Obama's critics charge that his recent action on gun control puts him at odds with all gun owners and enthusiasts.
As a hunter, gun owner and gun control advocate, I believe that the reality is different. In fact, Americans are far from poles apart on the issue of gun control. We recognize that all things entail some measure of risk as well as benefit, and we legislate regulations accordingly. Guns divide us because they fall in the gray area; we disagree as to whether their utility outweighs their risk. 
This is largely because we lack the data to inform our opinions. For decades, the gun lobby has done its best to suppress all research on firearms and their dangers. And as President Obama said on Wednesday, ''We don't benefit from not knowing the science of this epidemic of violence.'' His promise to back research into this area is encouraging.
Only when we understand the cold, hard facts behind gun violence will we be able to properly balance Second Amendment rights with the fundamental human right to peace of mind and safety.
ZACHARY MILLER Fleetwood, Pa., Jan. 17, 2013
To the Editor:
''Gun Reform for a Generation'' (editorial, Jan. 17) holds out hope for an attempt at sanity in the effort to control gun violence.
I would happily register as a non-gun-owning citizen who is qualified to use a weapon accurately and safely. This would be no intrusion on my civil liberties. It would simply note that I have been trained in the safe use of firearms (in my military days). If there were a reasonably accurate and functioning national database, it might catch some mentally ill people who applied for or had already registered for their guns.
No one is trying to take guns away from those who feel they are needed. But government has every right to know who has what guns and to what use the guns and ammunition may be put.
As a veteran, I trust our military and our civilian police to intelligently and openly protect me from ''all enemies, foreign and domestic.'' They have guns, have gone through security checks and know how to use them safely. It's past time for ''gun reform for a generation.''
THEODORE S. VOELKER New York, Jan. 17, 2013
To the Editor:
Re ''I Went After Guns. Obama Can, Too'' (Op-Ed, Jan. 17):
While I'm not usually inclined to agree with John Howard, the former Australian prime minister, he was right to introduce broad and sweeping gun laws in Australia in 1996. But his article did not address a stark difference between the thinking of Americans and Australians.
Australians, myself included, simply cannot comprehend this embedded and unwavering belief in the United States Constitution and the refusal to update the Second Amendment. As far as I'm aware, there is no desperate need for any ''regulated militia'' to exist within the United States in 2013.
The talk of guns is something that isn't discussed too regularly in Australian society, and we don't believe that the government is trying to curb our freedom. I hope that history looks back in generations to come and sees the Newtown, Conn., massacre and President Obama as the catalysts that brought about a safer America.
VINCENT ALVARO Sydney, Australia, Jan. 17, 2013
To the Editor:
Re ''Warning Signs of Violent Acts Often Unclear'' (front page, Jan. 16):
While Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and the New York Legislature are truly to be congratulated on their swift passage of strong gun control legislation, their efforts to involve mental health professionals as an early warning system may be overly optimistic.
As your article notes, psychological prediction tools are uncertain, and the new law is shortsighted as to how such efforts could backfire and make disturbed people less likely to reveal their intentions. After all, the cornerstone of psychotherapy is confidentiality.
Without that, very few patients would reveal anything that would risk a report to the authorities. Much more input from mental health professionals experienced with severely disturbed and potentially violent patients should be sought in shaping legislation.
LOUIS J. JACOBSON Manhasset, N.Y., Jan. 16, 2013
The writer is a former chief psychologist at the Creedmoor Psychiatric Center and Kingsboro Psychiatric Center.
To the Editor:
Given the problems with requiring mental health professionals to report certain patients to law enforcement, I propose an alternative. Many commercial companies and government agencies screen job applicants for sensitive positions using the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory test.
Gun permit applicants should be required to take this test and achieve passing scores on the schizophrenia and psychopathic deviation scales.
The proven ability of this test to identify fake responses would eliminate a flaw in the background check process -- falsifying or fudging background information.
JOHN I. ERDOS East Hampton, N.Y., Jan. 16, 2013
To the Editor:
Re ''White House Denounces Web Video by N.R.A.'' (news article, Jan. 17):
The Republican Party desperately needs someone to stand up to the National Rifle Association and say ''enough!'' When the children of the president of the United States are used in a political ad of any kind, a boundary of decency and respect has been crossed.
To mention his daughters and their school to promote gun freedom reflects an organization that is no longer just tone deaf to the vast majority of Americans, but overtly defiant. Until someone in the G.O.P. denounces the organization, the exodus from the party will continue, and with good reason.

Crowds Gather in Turkey to Honor 3 Kurds Killed in Paris

HATAY, Turkey -- Tens of thousands of people gathered Thursday in the southern city of Diyarbakir to mourn the deaths of three Kurdish activists murdered in Paris last week, an outpouring that some said amounted to the largest political gathering that the Turkish authorities had ever allowed the Kurds to stage.
With fragile peace talks to end three decades of armed insurgency just beginning, top Turkish and Kurdish officials called for calm, and none of the national television networks carried the event live. But a few Web portals provided real-time coverage as crowds accompanying three funeral trucks for the women poured into Batikent Square in Diyarbakir, the hub of Kurdish political and cultural life. The most prominent of the slain women, Sakine Cansiz, was a founding member of the insurgent group, the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or P.K.K. Experts said she had been raising funds for the group in Europe. 
The private IMC TV portal showed that many in the crowd wore white scarves for peace and black clothing for mourning, as suggested by the pro-Kurdish Peace and Democracy Party, the organizer of the ceremony.
The reason for the killings remains unclear, but they were widely perceived as an effort to derail the talks, which for the first time involve Abdullah Ocalan, the founder and spiritual leader of the P.K.K., who has been held in an isolated island prison since his capture in 1999.
Ms. Cansiz, 55, was his close ally. The two women found dead with her -- Fidan Dogan, who would have turned 31 on Thursday, and Leyla Soylemez, 24 -- were Kurdish activists. All three were found dead at the unmarked Kurdistan Information Office in Paris last Thursday, apparently shot by one or more gunmen with silenced pistols. The office had been locked from the outside, and three shell casings were found on the floor. Two women were shot in the head, one in the stomach.
Turkish government officials speculated that the killings might have emerged from internal conflict in the P.K.K. The P.K.K. is known for meting out strict operational discipline, including punishments as extreme as executions for wayward members. Some Kurdish political activists countered by accusing the Turkish ''deep state,'' a nationalist underground network that was behind hundreds of extrajudicial assaults against Kurds in the 1990s and considers any ethnicity a threat against Turkey's national unity.
The mourners on Thursday carried pictures of the slain women and round black banners that read, ''We all are Sakine,'' ''We all are Fidan'' and ''We all are Leyla.''
Turkish security forces remained at a distance despite the crowds, which some took as a sign of the government's sincerity in the quest for a peace deal.
''In the past, the police would have definitely interfered such a funeral crowd, and things would have turned violent,'' one Kurd who attended the ceremony, Mustafa Iritas, said in a phone interview. ''This is a very good sign for the talks. I am very happy, and have better hopes for peace.''
The talks between Mr. Ocalan and senior Turkish intelligence officials started in the last week of December. They focus on Ankara's demands for the P.K.K. to lay down arms unilaterally and those who were involved in fighting to settle in a location other than Turkey. Mr. Ocalan's participation drew strong criticism in nationalist circles that he was being given too much recognition, but it overwhelmingly pleased the nearly 15 million Kurds in Turkey and drastically elevated their sense of the chances for a resolution.
''Even today that we've lost three comrades to a massacre, our people call for peace and brotherhood of peoples,'' Ahmet Turk, a prominent Kurdish politician, said as he addressed the crowd from the top of a bus parked in front of three coffins wrapped in P.K.K. flags. ''However, peace would only come with mutual respect and communication of people, with justice and equality.''
More than 40,000 people have been killed in P.K.K. attacks or anti-P.K.K. military operations since the group, which has a separatist agenda, took up arms in 1984. It conducted suicide bombings and assaults at tourism centers, prompting Turkey, the European Union and the United States to label it a terrorist organization.
Many in the group, like Ms. Cansiz, fled to Europe as political refugees after the 1980 military coup in Turkey. But they continued to generate financial resources and political propaganda as the P.K.K. continued sporadic attacks in Turkey from bases in the Qandil Mountains in northern Iraq.
Peace talks in Oslo in 2011 broke down after recordings were leaked to the news media, igniting strong reactions in nationalist circles that oppose any contact with the rebels. A surge of violence followed.
Cumali Soylemez, the father of Ms. Soylemez, was one of the last speakers who took the stage before coffins were sent off to Tunceli, Kahramanmaras and Mersin for burials on Friday.
''I do not have much to say, except that they wanted peace and got killed by traitors, but we will continue with peace,'' he said. ''Peace is a good thing. Damn the war; war is just bad.''

Militants in Algeria Refuse to Surrender and Continue to Hold Hostages

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER and RICK GLADSTONE; Adam Nossiter reported from Bamako, and Rick Gladstone from New York. Reporting was contributed by Elisabeth Bumiller, John F. Burns and Julia Werdigier from London; Alan Cowell, Steven Erlanger and Scott Sayare from Paris; Michael R.

BAMAKO, Mali -- Defying the Algerian Army's demands to give up, the band of Islamist militant kidnappers who terrorized a remote Saharan gas field complex still held at least 10 and possibly dozens of foreign hostages on Friday, and a senior Algerian government official said there were no talks planned to end the standoff.
''They are being told to surrender, that's it,'' the official said on the third day of the crisis. ''No negotiations. That is a doctrine with us.''
The United States said for the first time that Americans were among the remaining captives and confirmed the first known death of an American hostage, Frederick Buttaccio, 58, of Katy, Tex. Linked In, the social networking site for professionals, lists a Frederick Buttaccio as a sales operations coordinator for BP, the British energy giant that helped run the complex, but a company official said it would not comment on any employee who may have been at the facility. 
France said a French citizen also was known to have been killed.
All foreign governments with citizens at risk were still scrambling for basic information about the missing as they ferried escaped hostages out of the country on military aircraft and urged Algeria to use restraint.
''This is an extremely difficult and dangerous situation,'' Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton told reporters in Washington. Describing a conversation she had earlier Friday with Algeria's prime minister, Abdelmalek Sellal, Mrs. Clinton said she had emphasized to him that ''the utmost care must be taken to preserve innocent life.''
Algeria's state news agency, APS, said 12 Algerian and foreign workers had been killed since Algerian special forces began an assault against the kidnappers on Thursday. It was the highest civilian death toll Algerian officials that have provided in the aftermath of the assault, which freed captives and killed kidnappers but also left some hostages dead in one of the worst mass abductions of foreign workers in years.
Previous unofficial estimates of the foreign casualties have ranged from 4 to 35. The American who died, Mr. Buttaccio, lived in a gated community in Katy, a suburb that is about 30 miles west of downtown Houston.The Algerian news agency also said that 18 militants had been killed and that the country's special forces were dealing with remnants of a ''terrorist group'' that was still holding hostages in the refinery area of the gas field in remote eastern Algeria.
It also gave a new sense of how many people may have been at the facility when the militants seized it on Wednesday, asserting that nearly 650 had managed to leave the site since then, including 573 Algerians and nearly half of the 132 foreigners it said had been abducted. But that still left many people unaccounted for.
The senior Algerian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he believed there were about 10 hostages, under the control of possibly 13 to 15 militants, but he emphasized that ''nothing is certain'' about the numbers, which have varied wildly since the crisis began. He also said that there were other workers on the site ''who are still in hiding'' but that the Algerian military had secured the residential part of the gas-field complex.
''What remains are a few terrorists, holding a few hostages, who have taken refuge in the gas factory,'' he said. ''It's a site that's very tricky to handle.''
The official also challenged the criticism made in some foreign capitals that the Algerian military had acted hastily and with excessive force. On the contrary, he said, Algerian forces had returned fire only as the militants sought to escape the complex with their captives.
''There was a reaction by the army,'' he said. ''They tried to flee and they were stopped,'' the official said of the militants. ''They came absolutely to blow the whole site up. These are bitter-enders.''
Earlier Friday, the State Department spokeswoman, Victoria Nuland, said that not all Americans had been freed. ''We have American hostages,'' she said, offering the first update on what was known about United States citizens since officials confirmed on Thursday that seven or eight of them had been inside the gas-field complex.
Ms. Nuland also said the United States would not consider a reported offer made by the kidnappers to exchange two Americans for two prominent figures imprisoned in the United States -- Omar Abdel Rahman, a sheik convicted of plotting to bomb New York landmarks, and Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani woman convicted of shooting at two American soldiers in Afghanistan. It was impossible to confirm that offer, which was reported by the Washington-based SITE Intelligence Group, a service that tracks jihadist activity on the Internet.
Intensifying the uncertainties, a spokesman for the militants, who belong to a group called Al Mulathameen, said Friday that they planned further attacks in Algeria, according to a report by the Mauritanian news agency ANI, which maintains frequent contact with militant groups in the region. The spokesman called upon Algerians to ''keep away from the installations of foreign companies because we will suddenly attack where no one would expect it,'' ANI reported.
The Algerian military operation to end the gas-field siege was done without consulting foreign governments whose citizens worked at the facility. It has been marked by a fog of conflicting reports, compounded by the remoteness of the facility, near a town called In Amenas that is hundreds of miles across the desert from the Algerian capital, Algiers, and close to the Libyan border.
In London, Prime Minister David Cameron told Parliament that the number of Britons at risk was estimated late Thursday at ''less than 30.'' That number has now been ''quite significantly reduced,'' he said, adding that he could not give details because the crisis was continuing. British officials have said they know at least one Briton was killed when the militants seized the facility.
Offering a broad account of Algeria's handling of the operation, he told lawmakers: ''We were not informed of this in advance. I was told by the Algerian prime minister while it was taking place. He said that the terrorists had tried to flee, that they judged there to be an immediate threat to the lives of the hostages and had felt obliged to respond.''
In Paris, Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius confirmed for the first time that a French citizen had been killed, although it was not clear exactly when. The victim, whom Mr. Fabius identified as Yann Desjeux, had contacted relatives as recently as noon Thursday, according to the French newspaper Sud Ouest, which also said it had spoken with Mr. Desjeux. Three other French citizens were involved in the hostage situation but are now safe, Mr. Fabius said.
Frustration with Algeria's information vacuum seemed particularly vexing to Japan, where an energy company that had assigned 17 employees to the gas-field facility said Friday that seven were confirmed safe but that 10 were unaccounted for. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had personally appealed to his Algerian counterpart by phone early Friday to stop the military action, the Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported, but was told that military action was ''the best response and we are continuing our operation.''
Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta met with Mr. Cameron in London as Pentagon officials were continuing to try to learn details about the raid.
''We are working around the clock to ensure the safe return of our citizens, and we will continue to be in close consultation with the Algerian government,'' Mr. Panetta said in a speech in London before meeting with Mr. Cameron.
A separate hostage situation of sorts appeared to have been averted at a village in Mali, the neighboring country where a French military intervention to stop radical Islamists may have been the catalyst for the Algerian gas-field seizure by the Al Mulathameen group. But details were sketchy.
A senior French official in Paris said Malian Islamist fighters, threatened by French and Malian soldiers, had occupied the village, Diabaly, and were threatening to use residents as human shields if attacked. But by Friday evening, a local official in Diabaly said the Islamists and most of the villagers had fled. ''There's practically nothing left in Diabaly except burned-out vehicles and boxes of ammunition,'' said the official, Benco Ba, a local parliamentary deputy.
The Algerian fighters had been prepared to attack the gas complex for nearly two months, the militants' spokesman said, according to the ANI report, because they believed that the Algerian government ''was surely going to be the ally of France'' in the Malian conflict.
Hostages and analysts have said the attackers appeared well-prepared and deeply knowledgeable about the site, and there was evidence to suggest they had informers on the site or were in contact with workers there. An official at BP indicated earlier in the week that the attackers had shut off production at the site at the time of the attack, for instance. And at least two former hostages, interviewed independently, have said the fighters were aware of labor tensions and plans for a strike among catering workers on the site.
''We know you're oppressed; we've come here so that you can have your rights,'' the militants told Algerians on the site, according to one former hostage. Another hostage said the fighters had asked about the plans for a strike.

Chief Keef Is Sentenced For Violating Probation

BYLINE: By JAMES C. MCKINLEY JR.

SECTION: Section C; Column 0; The Arts/Cultural Desk; ARTSBEAT; Pg. 3

LENGTH: 214 words

Chief Keef, the teenage Chicago rapper who often presents a street-tough image, was visibly shaken and pleaded for leniency when he was sentenced to 60 days in juvenile detention on Thursday for violating his probation on a gun charge, The Chicago Sun-Times reported. 
"I am a very good-hearted person," the 17-year-old rapper, whose real name is Keith Cozart, told Judge Carl Anthony Walker in Cook County Juvenile Court. "I am sorry for anything that I have done wrong." But Judge Walker was unmoved. He said that Chief Keef had ignored the court's orders regarding his probation for having pointed a gun at a police officer. The judge said the rapper had violated an order to stay away from firearms when he agreed to do a videotaped interview with Pitchfork at a New York gun range in June and fired a rifle there.
The prosecution brought up the murderous persona Chief Keef often adopts in songs, particularly the recent single "Love Sosa," as an argument for detaining him. Chief Keef, his voice trembling and breaking, told the judge he was misunderstood, according to The Chicago Reader. "My G.E.D. is almost complete," he said. "And the person people are trying to make me out to be is not who I am."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

A Scene of Carnage Is a Movie Theater Again

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 10

LENGTH: 746 words

AURORA, Colo. -- Some came to the movies limping and on crutches, still hobbled from the fusillade of bullets that cut through bodies and chairs and walls that night in July. They came holding hands and snapping photos, dressed up in blazers to meet the governor or wearing T-shirts emblazoned with the face of a fallen friend.
Six months have passed since an armor-clad gunman opened fire inside Theater 9 of a multiplex here in Denver's eastern suburbs, killing 12 people and wounding at least 58 more. On Thursday, the newly remodeled and renamed Century Aurora cinema opened for the first time since the shooting. 
Hundreds came. There were police officers who helped ferry the wounded and dead to hospitals. There were survivors who dropped to the floor or fled the firecracker pops of semiautomatic gunfire, and friends and family members of the moviegoers who did not escape.
''I wanted to come back,'' said Cheyenne Avery, 16, a close friend of 18-year-old A. J. Boik, an aspiring art teacher who was killed during that July 20 midnight screening of ''The Dark Knight Rises.'' ''I think about him all the time. I want to celebrate his life.''
The mayor and governor made speeches. Religious leaders mused about suffering and asked for God's guidance. The theater handed out free popcorn and Twizzlers, and offered a free screening of ''The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey'' for anyone who wanted to stay past the brief memorial.
People said it was surreal to return to a place that had been a stage for such carnage. They passed through a doorway where they had run frantically into the night. They again smelled popcorn in the air, instead of gunpowder and tear gas.
For many, attending the ceremonial reopening was as much about defiance as memory or grief.
''I cannot allow the shooter in any way, shape or form to win,'' the mayor of Aurora, Steve Hogan, told the families. ''We will not let this tragedy define us.''
Put another way: ''You're not going to heal unless you confront the thing that you fear,'' said Kelly Bowen, who had been sitting in the fourth row of the stadium-style seats when the gunman slipped in through an emergency exit door, lobbed a tear gas canister and started shooting.
But the road to reopening has been painful and divisive. Although a solid majority of Aurora residents said they wanted their theater back, some families touched by the massacre thought it was too soon, or simply insensitive, to once again screen shoot-'em-up blockbusters and sell expensive snacks in a building where their loved ones had been killed.
''They just carpeted over a crime scene,'' said Caren Teves, who lost her son, Alex, an incandescent 24-year-old who studied counseling. ''It's just repulsive. You don't want to go near it. You don't want to be associated with it. You can't get far enough away from it.''
Although the chief executive of the theater's owner, Cinemark, flew to Aurora immediately after the shooting, Ms. Teves and other family members said they felt slighted by the company. She said Cinemark never sent a condolence card or any other communication until it sent out the invitations to Thursday's night of remembrance.
Several victims' families and survivors have filed lawsuits against Cinemark, accusing it of lax security. Some have said they wanted to see the theater torn down, or converted to a memorial.
''I know a lot of people won't feel the way that I did, but the ghosts of their children won't be in that theater,'' said Lonnie Phillips, the stepfather of a budding sports reporter named Jessica Ghawi who was killed. ''I'll never go into any movie theater for the rest of my life.''
On Thursday, even employees said it was hard to recognize the Century theater.
The green carpets are new, the paint fresh. The blood and shell casings are long gone. Theater 9 is now Auditorium I, an ''Extreme Digital'' theater with new seats and a big new screen, to replace the one torn down by police officers who were checking for booby traps or other dangers. There is no plaque or rock to commemorate what happened there, no list of names or wall of photos.
But Dylan Boxer, 21, who escaped Theater 9, said the shooting and its setting were indelibly linked. He had already returned once, during a walk-through on Tuesday for people directly affected, and he came again to look for familiar faces from that night, and to show some solidarity with the families. But he would find somewhere else to go to the movies.
''It's still stained,'' he said.

So, a Peace Activist Takes a BB Gun to a Meeting ...

BYLINE: By VIVIAN YEE

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 14

LENGTH: 618 words

NORWALK, Conn. -- Entering on her grandson's arm, Estelle Margolis, 86, a longtime peace activist from nearby Westport, cut an unlikely figure in State Superior Court here. But there she was on Friday morning, standing briefly to plead not guilty to the one charge against her: breach of peace, second degree.
Ms. Margolis, the widow of a well-known local civil liberties lawyer who has staged weekly protests of the war in Afghanistan for a decade, caused a minor stir on Jan. 8 when she took a Red Ryder BB gun -- the rifle Ralphie covets in ''A Christmas Story'' -- to a debate over gun control held by Westport's legislative body, the Representative Town Meeting. 
She wanted to demonstrate how easy buying a gun was, she told the police, but she was arrested after a town representative saw her carrying the weapon under a white cloth.
Her arrest may have stymied her protest, but Ms. Margolis is nevertheless now seeing her views aired all over town.
The episode has generated debate on local news Web sites, where the headlines usually tell of shoplifters and charity drives, and between friends who said she had meant no harm and others who acknowledged her respected place in town but maintained that her protest could have ended with someone hurt.
Ms. Margolis was also carrying a package of BB gun pellets, a box of .45-caliber ammunition and a Walmart receipt for the goods, according to a police report.
''Regardless of what her reasoning was to bring the BB gun rifle to the meeting, it was a poor decision that created alarm and concern to the public,'' Westport police officials said in a statement. ''This incident could have clearly escalated into a tragedy.''
For the record, a Westport police spokesman said, buying a BB gun like the Red Ryder, which is often sold as a toy and typically does not require a license to own, is legal.
Ms. Margolis, who works as an artist, had been arrested once before, in the 1960s, a friend said, when she led a group to lie down in a road to stop traffic to protest the Vietnam War. She declined to comment on Friday, saying her lawyer had advised her to keep silent until her next court appearance, on Feb. 20.
Rozanne Gates, a friend, said, ''Estelle and her husband are just absolute stalwarts of this town.'' Ms. Gates said: ''But when you run up against people who don't know, and they get scared, and fear takes over -- this is nuts. I mean, she's everyone's conscience when it comes to a peaceful world.''
She added: ''I mean, she has afternoon tea at her house. Please.''
In a letter to local newspapers, Ms. Margolis said she recognized her protest was misguided, especially coming soon after the school shooting in Newtown, a little more than 20 miles away.
''I need to apologize to everyone in Westport for my ill-conceived attempt to bring attention to the pressing need for serious gun and ammunition control,'' she wrote.
''I deeply regret the fact that what I did was dangerous and created a great deal of anxiety for everyone and especially the young police officers at the meeting.''
In the same letter, she called for curbs on guns and ammunition and for better mental health care, and criticized the National Rifle Association as holding too much sway.
Though she was not there to see it, Ms. Margolis might have been gratified by the symbolic resolution that the Westport representatives passed after she was escorted from Town Hall: they voted to support a ban on assault weapons 27 to 1, with 3 abstentions.
Ms. Margolis has told friends she was shocked to discover she could buy the Red Ryder without even giving her name, though she has not tried her experiment with a real firearm.
''Oh God, no,'' Ms. Gates said. ''She's scared to death of guns.''

Please Take Away My Right to a Gun

BYLINE: By WENDY BUTTON. 
Wendy Button is a former political speechwriter.

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; OP-ED CONTRIBUTOR; Pg. 17

LENGTH: 873 words

A FEW years ago, I awoke at 2:30 a.m. to more than a ''rapping, rapping at my chamber door.'' It was a full-force pounding of a body trying to break into my little house in Washington, D.C. It was the sound and scenario that, as a single woman living alone, I feared more than spiders in the house.
Because I was writing political speeches at the time, my BlackBerry slept on the pillow beside me. I grabbed it and looked out my bedroom window at the stoop below. There he was: tall, dark clothes, big. He backed up and then raced to the door, pounding his body against it. Then he kicked at it the way actors take boots to the heads of bad guys in the movies. 
I dialed 911 and ran downstairs, my 100-pound Newfoundland with me.
I gave the dispatcher my address, let her know that I lived around the corner from a police station and said, ''Please hurry.'' She heard the loud noise and remained on the line with me.
I put the BlackBerry on speaker and pushed a heavy armchair toward the door. I watched as the wood expanded with each pound. The white paint splintered some. The deadbolt held at the top, but the bottom half of the door popped open, letting in the steam heat from the summer night. I took that chair and slammed it so the side pushed the door back in line with the frame. I held that chair with everything my 5 foot 3 inches had. My dog sat right by me on the rug, ready.
''The police are outside,'' the dispatcher said.
I let go of the chair's arms and thanked the woman for staying on the phone with me. I answered the questions from the police and looked at the drunk man in the back of the patrol car, kicking at the seats. When they left, I pushed the couch, chair, coffee table and even a lamp in front of the locked door. I did that every night for a week until a steel-gated security door was installed.
And then, I did more.
I considered buying a gun. The threat of violence rattles you like that. What rolled round my head after that dark morning was: what if I hadn't heard the noise, what if it's different next time? While I held that chair with all of my strength, I wished that I had had a gun because if he had gotten in, then I could have pointed it at him, maybe deterred him and if necessary pulled the trigger.
So I looked at guns. Some had mother-of-pearl handles and looked like something Mae West would use in a movie. Others were Glocks, shotguns and rifles. I had gone as far as to dial the number of the Metropolitan Police Department's firearms registration division and begin the process. Then I stopped and put my BlackBerry down.
I remembered who I am.
I am one of the millions of people in this country who live with depression. I knew that in the gun registration form there would be a version of this question: Have you ever voluntarily or involuntarily been committed to a hospital? The answer is yes -- voluntarily. But because my hospitalization was years earlier and I wasn't in treatment at the time, I could have gotten a gun.
My depression appeared for the first time in the late '90s, right before I began writing for politicians. It comes and goes like fog. Medicine can help. I have my tricks to manage and get through it. Sometimes it sticks around for a day or a week, and sometimes it stays away for a couple of years. But it never leads me to sleep all day, cry and wear sweat pants like the people in the commercials. You'd look at me and never know that sometimes my fight against the urge to die is so tough the only way I get through it is second by second; I live by the second hand.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 38,364 Americans lost that fight in 2010 and committed suicide; 19,392 used a gun. No one ever attempted to break down my door in the early morning again, but I had an episode when my depression did come back in full force in the early winter of 2009, after I made a career-ending decision and isolated myself too much; on a January night in 2010; and again in May 2012, after testifying in the federal criminal trial of John Edwards, my former boss. If I had purchased that gun and it had been in my possession, I'm not sure I would have been able to resist and would be here typing these words.
The other day, the president and the vice president announced their plans to curb gun violence in the wake of the shooting in Newtown, Conn. I agree with all of their measures. But I believe they should be bolder and stop walking on eggshells about what to do with people like me and those not even close to being like me but still labeled with the crazy term ''mentally ill.'' The executive actions the president signed to increase access and treatment are all good, although the experts will struggle with confidentiality and privacy issues.
But since most people like me are more likely to harm ourselves than to turn into mass-murdering monsters, our leaders should do more to keep us safe from ourselves.
Please take away my Second Amendment right. Do more to help us protect ourselves because what's most likely to wake me in the early hours isn't a man's body slamming at my door but depression, that raven, tapping, rapping, banging for relief.
I have a better chance of surviving if I never have the option of being able to pull the trigger.

One Comic's Identity Crisis

BYLINE: By JASON ZINOMAN

SECTION: Section C; Column 0; The Arts/Cultural Desk; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 1104 words

In his first television special Dane Cook charged onstage wearing a black tank top and crouched like a giant frog aiming to catch a fly. ''I think every comic wants to be a rock 'n' roll star,'' he said in that 2000 show. ''I do. That's my dream.''
Seven years later it came true. Running around a stage at Madison Square Garden was a new version of Mr. Cook. Gone was the clownish, Jim Carrey-like physicality, replaced by a preening strut. ''This is like a party here tonight, you feel it, right?'' he shouted. They did.
Watching his young crowd roar in laughter at jokes that, to put it generously, varied in quality, makes you understand why Steve Martin soured on comedy after playing arenas. In an environment that resembles a boy-band concert, how can a comic know what's working? If they laugh at everything, is it still funny? 
How Dane Cook, now 40, became one of the biggest names in stand-up (with almost three million Twitter followers) is only slightly less baffling than how he has become one of the most reviled. A moderately talented, hard-working performer with an obnoxious streak, he has an ordinary frat-boy exterior that hides an energetic juggernaut of ambition and drive.
Mr. Cook may have been the first Internet-age comic. He pioneered the exploitation of social media to build a career, consistently responding to fans on MySpace when that service mattered. ''It was unheard-of then to use it like he did,'' said Patrick Milligan, who helps run the club the Stand, near Gramercy Park.
While the Internet can build popularity quickly, it can also accelerate a backlash. When Mr. Cook made a joke about the Aurora, Colo., shootings, it went viral, and he was forced to apologize. When he performed new material earlier in 2012, T. J. Miller, a comic on the same bill at the Laugh Factory in Los Angeles, tweeted criticism. The media picked it up, leading each comic to argue his case on podcasts.
In certain comedy and media circles, contempt for Mr. Cook is knee-jerk, even clichי. At Joe's Pub in the East Village, I once saw Benjamin Walker, an actor who dabbles in comedy, announce that he didn't want to be like Mr. Cook. Hating Dane Cook is a kind of credential-building shorthand. Andrew Dice Clay was once even more controversial. But unlike Mr. Cook, he emerged before the Internet, and his persona has remained relatively constant. His New Year's Eve Showtime special shows him to be basically the same proudly crass, nursery-rhyming comic who rocketed to fame in the 1990s.
Mr. Cook, by contrast, evolves. His early material was exuberantly silly. He did a long bit about wanting to be a snake. He showed traces of self-deprecation. His best album, from 2003, is ''Harmful if Swallowed,'' and it included jokes about working at Burger King, which in an attempt to make a terrible job sound better he referred to as ''the BK Lounge.''
In some of the loosely organized stories on his next album, ''Retaliation,'' he captured the amusing ways that a thin-skinned guy avoids honesty. There were even hints of vulnerability in the manner of Martin Lawrence. But Mr. Cook's macho persona also resorted to cheap laughs through dumb sexual boasts and imagined violence. He was never self-aware enough to be insightful, but his committed, relentlessly upbeat charisma and ambition had a certain brute force.
As he grew more famous, the vulnerability faded, and his persona turned smug. This hurt him more than it would other comics because the strength of his act lies in his force of personality, not carefully wrought jokes. Once he started chuckling over the imagined prospect of harming a girl he had gotten pregnant, part of his appeal evaporated. Boy bands carefully protect their images for a reason.
He starred in some brutally reviewed movies like ''Good Luck Chuck.'' Accusations of joke stealing emerged. These dogged him and became the subject of a scene in the television series ''Louie.'' Louis C. K., who wrote the episode, asks a grumpy Mr. Cook for a favor, which leads to an argument over whether Mr. Cook stole his jokes. Mr. Cook says he didn't. Louis C. K. says that he believes he did, albeit unintentionally.
The scene is less balanced than it appears. The controversy focused on three jokes. At worst, Mr. Cook used similar premises to create markedly different bits from Louis C. K.'s. If employing the same premise is the standard for theft, countless comics would be guilty.
But comparing these jokes makes you realize that the premises make less of an impact than what is done with them. One of the jokes in question marvels at how parents could name their children anything. Mr. Cook thinks of naming his kid after the transformer Optimus Prime, while Louis C. K. takes a more imaginative tack, proposing the expression ''Ladies and gentleman,'' so, when exasperated, he could say, ''Ladies and gentleman, please!''
Mr. Cook's last album of new material, the 2009 ''Isolated Incident,'' introduced another persona that's more sober, confessional. He begins with a rare topical joke about President Obama's name. Where he once did a bit about talking a woman into sex even though he didn't have a condom, he now jokes about turning down sex because there's no birth control. In the Comedy Central special based on this album, he enters the stage quietly, the camera behind him, through an unglamorous backstage.
Other comics are as desperate for success as Mr. Cook, but they hide it better. He didn't just wear that black tank top; at the end of his 2000 special he ripped it off, raising his hands in triumph. Inevitably, Mr. Cook has tried to leverage his toxic reputation by playing jerks, but it's not so easy. He was an obnoxious D.J. in a pilot of the sitcom ''Next Caller,'' but NBC chose not to broadcast the show in October, even though several episodes had been filmed.
The previous year he was to play a sexist cad in Neil LaBute's ''Fat Pig'' on Broadway, but the financing fell apart. Last month he was given another chance at television: NBC signed a new deal with him. But tellingly, the only role that has worked out for him lately is that of a Nazi.
Playing that goose-stepping playwright, Franz Liebkind, in a short run of ''The Producers'' in Los Angeles last summer, Mr. Cook was surprisingly good, better than Will Ferrell in the movie version. His singing was solid, and his jittery clowning loose-limbed and aptly silly. His well-reviewed turn was a reminder of his early stand-up: goofy, brazenly broad, selling it.
It's a performance that made you believe that there's one way that Mr. Cook has not changed. More than anything, he still wants to be a rock star.

Mother Admits She Put Pistol in 7-Year-Old's Bag, Police Say

The mother of a 7-year-old who took a handgun to his public elementary school in Queens was arrested on Friday, the police said.
The woman, Deborah Farley, 53, was charged with criminal possession of a weapon, endangering the welfare of a child, drug possession and several other weapons-related charges. Judge Mary R. O'Donoghue of Queens Criminal Court set her bail at $35,000. Ms. Farley is expected to return to court on Feb. 6.
Ms. Farley, according to the police, admitted on Friday morning that she placed a handgun, ammunition and a flare gun in her son's Batman backpack on Wednesday night and then forgot to take them out before he went to school the next morning. 
The police said the child did not know he was bringing the weapon to school, though he discovered that there was a gun in his bag before school officials were alerted and the weapon was recovered by the authorities.
While the police gave a detailed account of the mother's statement, the boy's father, Walter Orozco, 56, denied that either he or his wife owned a gun and maintained that they had no idea how a weapon could have ended up in the boy's bag.
''We've been living together for 11 years,'' Mr. Orozco said Friday morning. ''We never had a gun.''
Mr. Orozco said he spoke to his son, who told him he discovered the gun in his bag but did not know how it got there.
By the father's account, the episode could have had a much more tragic ending, since the child felt bullied at school and often did not want to go to class.
''They called him sissy and white boy,'' Mr. Orozco said, adding: ''He didn't want to go to school. He fakes like he's coughing when he gets up in the morning.''
He added, ''We always complained, but the school didn't do anything.''
The police gave a very different version of events. Ms. Farley told detectives she was outside walking in Queens on Wednesday night, carrying her son's backpack, with the gun and ammunition inside. She had also put a flare gun in the bag.
She forgot to remove the items when she returned home, according to the police, and the next morning her son grabbed his bag and went off to class at Wave Preparatory Elementary School in Far Rockaway.
Ms. Farley soon realized that she had left the gun in the bag, the police said, and rushed to the school, hoping to retrieve it without attracting attention. She signed the child out on the pretext that he had a dental appointment, the police said.
But when Ms. Farley made a quick search of the bag and did not immediately see the gun, she asked her son what he did with it.
''Thinking his mother was referring to the flare gun he had already given to another youngster in the school and not realizing himself that there was a handgun still in the bottom of his backpack,'' the boy said he gave it to a friend, said Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman for the Police Department.
''With that,'' Mr. Browne added, ''the mother told the principal, who alerted school safety officers, implemented a lockdown and located the other boy in one of the school's second-floor classrooms, where the unloaded Orion flare gun was found in his backpack.''
A more thorough examination of Ms. Farley's son's backpack led to a Phoenix Arms .22-caliber semiautomatic pistol, a magazine with 10 rounds of .22-caliber ammunition and 14 additional rounds in a plastic bag.
Ms. Farley -- who has four sons, ages 27, 21, 9 and 7 -- initially told the authorities that her 9-year-old son, who was at home, saw his 7-year-old brother take a gun to school.
She provided a different account early Friday after detectives confronted her with additional evidence found when they searched her home, including more .22-caliber bullets. They also said they had evidence that she had kept an unlicensed handgun in her home, on Cornaga Avenue. In the home, the police said they found seven small bags of marijuana.
The 7- and 9-year-old boys were placed protective care, the police said.
Far Rockaway residents described Ms. Farley as a gregarious, well-known presence in a rough neighborhood. Julio Blancosantos, 22, who has cerebral palsy, said: ''It doesn't matter that I have a disability. I would still get robbed.''
Still, one resident, who declined to give his full name because of safety concerns, said he had lived in the area a long time and did not understand why Ms. Farley would need a firearm. ''She knows everybody around here,'' he said.

A Pastor Offers Gift Cards for Guns, in Hopes of Saving a Life or Two

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; THIS LAND; Pg. 12

LENGTH: 1219 words

CINCINNATI -- Outside a squat Cincinnati church within sight of an elementary school, dozens of people with guns braced against the Tuesday morning cold, waiting. They had guns in their hands and guns in their handbags, guns swaddled in blankets and guns plopped in plastic bags. A .22 here, a sawed-off there, guns everywhere, a few still loaded.
Inside the church, two private security professionals with Glocks at the hip went over the ground rules for the gun buyback program about to begin. No police on the premises, no questions asked and no more than 10 people in the lobby at a time. Guns must be deemed operable before being exchanged for a $100 gift card. Oh, and the guns must be kept in bags, with muzzles down.
''I don't want them coming in with the weapon and just saying, 'Here you go,' '' explained Michael Brooks, 44, an electrician by trade and the day's lead security man, whose job was to create a controlled environment out of dozens of strangers walking into a church with guns. 
The doors to the President Drive Church of Christ opened, and the first in line took seats in the cramped lobby's welcoming warmth, some chatting, others silent. A burly man in hunting attire cradled two rifles in zippered cases. A slight man in a hooded sweatshirt clutched a plastic bag that drooped from the weight of metal. An older woman held a pocketbook in her lap.
Before long, Mr. Brooks summoned the woman to a foldout table propped just outside the church's small kitchen, now an arsenal-in-waiting. She removed a handgun from her pocketbook. He held the gun up and away, determined it to be operable and empty, and said, ''Thank you, ma'am.''
She was escorted into the church's sanctuary, where a table covered with gift cards sat before a large cross on the back wall. Soon her transaction was completed with no questions asked, beyond, Walmart, Target or Kroger?
''Target,'' was her answer.
So began another gun buyback program in the wake of last month's schoolhouse massacre in Newtown, Conn. Across the country, programs like this modest event, held on the birth date of the shooting victim Martin Luther King Jr., have become a familiar -- and controversial -- attempt at gentle gun control, often organized by people who do not know what else to do.
On Sunday, a front-page article in The Cincinnati Enquirer questioned the effectiveness of gun buybacks in a country that it said was awash with more than 300 million guns. It quoted criminologists who said that heightened police patrols and intervention with known criminals have more impact, and that buyback programs usually collect guns not likely to be used in crimes.
But the event's central organizer, Ennis Tait, a local pastor, stood his ground. Some of the guns might be old rifles traded in by hunters looking to upgrade, or ancient .22s tucked away in sock drawers, he conceded. But every gun collected -- and turned over to the police to be destroyed -- is a gun not found by a curious child, not reached for in a fit of anger over a slight on the street.
Over all, crime has been declining in Cincinnati, but this city of nearly 300,000 still had more than 50 homicides last year, most of them by bullet. On Christmas Day, for example, a 20-year-old woman was shot to death while visiting relatives not far from here.
''You get tired of going to funerals,'' Mr. Tait said, underscoring the point that for the volunteers running this buyback program, guns are not a theoretical concern.
Saying hello at the door was Mitch Morris, 56, who did prison time many years ago (''I was in a gun battle,'' he said, ''and somebody didn't make it home.''), and now helps others find alternatives to violent street life. Saying goodbye at the exit was J. C. Battle III, 65, a third-generation funeral home director in the city who knows too well the aesthetic challenges created by bullets.
Serving as host was the church's longtime pastor, Everett Brewer, 66, who just two weeks ago heard neighborhood gunfire greeting the new year. And supervising it all was Mr. Tait, 42, the pastor of the Church of the Living God, several miles closer to downtown, who is one of those forces of purpose often toiling in poor urban neighborhoods, working two cellphones, trying to nudge things forward.
He is opposed not to guns, he said, but to irresponsible possession, weak background checks and easy access to weapons meant for warfare. That is why, along with an organization of his called Project Nehemiah Ceasefire, he raised $3,500, most of it from his own congregation, to buy 35 $100 gift cards. Thirty-five gift cards meant 35 fewer guns, which meant, maybe, one or two fewer funerals.
One by one, people stepped out of the cold and into the lobby, to sit with their guns beneath a framed print of the Lord's Prayer and wait to be called by Mr. Brooks. One moment he was rejecting what was nothing more than a starter pistol; the next he was ejecting a bullet to clatter onto the kitchen's tile floor.
Each gun had its own story. Here was Lisa Williams, 51, presenting a treasure-chest jewelry box that contained a .25-caliber handgun. It's been in the family for a while, she said, but now there are children running around.
''They're little snoops,'' she said. ''They find everything.''
And here was Michelle Kirkland, 52, explaining that the gun she turned in was her grandfather's, but he died, and then her sister went looking for it because of some stuff that was going on in the street.
''So my mom suggested getting rid of it,'' Ms. Kirkland said, her handbag now holding a gift card instead of a .22.
Forty-five minutes after the door opened, the program had one gift card left and several dozen people still standing outside, where an entrepreneur named Tom Woolery was presenting competition. Holding a sign that said ''Cash for Guns$,'' he explained that he was offering to buy guns to save them from destruction.
As he spoke, the joyous shouts of children rose up from the school playground a few dozen yards downhill.
Mr. Tait quickly dispatched a volunteer to buy 40 more $100 gift cards, charged to his credit card -- an expense that he would have to explain to his congregation later. But this allowed the process to continue, and soon two dozen people were sitting in quiet rows in the sanctuary, as if waiting for a sermon, and not a gift card.
A cheer went up when the volunteer returned with more gift cards, but they too soon vanished. After doing some math in his head -- math heavily reliant on anticipated donations -- Mr. Tait offered i.o.u.'s to anyone else who turned in a gun. The line kept moving until Mr. Tait sensed that he could not push his luck any further.
''You've got to tell the people no more,'' he said. ''I'm already $10,000 out.''
The total: 145 guns, including dozens of shotguns and rifles spread out on the kitchen floor, next to the refrigerator, and dozens of handguns arrayed on the counter, where the church's coffee pot usually sits.
As schoolchildren headed home by cutting through a path behind the church, the two security professionals cataloged the guns and used plastic twists to lock and disengage the weapons. They packed the guns in bags and carried them out to the trunk of Mr. Brooks's white sedan.
The car pulled away from the church, bound for a police station, its back end sagging slightly under the weight.

Newspaper Takes Down Map Listing Gun Permits

BYLINE: By J. DAVID GOODMAN

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 14

LENGTH: 493 words

A newspaper has removed an interactive online map of handgun permit holders in two New York counties that drew nationwide anger and prompted threats against its staff, the publisher said Friday. 
The decision by the paper, The Journal News, to take the information off its Web site came in response to the passage of sweeping gun legislation in Albany this week, the publisher, Janet Hasson, said in a statement. ''While the new law does not require us to remove the data, we believe that doing so complies with its spirit,'' she said.
Legislators pushed to add the measure to the new law in response to the paper's publication after an outcry from gun-rights advocates and some law enforcement groups.
''From the beginning it was irresponsible conduct from The Journal News,'' said Roy T. Richter, the head of the Captains Endowment Association, which represents the upper echelons of the New York Police Department. He said thousands of retired officers live in the two counties -- Westchester and Rockland, just north of the city -- and some objected to seeing their personal information published on the newspaper's Web site.
''The problem is,'' he said, ''once you put things on the Internet, they're stuck out there.''
The newspaper, which is based in White Plains, used public records to create the map, a clickable collection of the names and addresses of thousands of permit holders in the two counties. Since it first appeared in late December, the online map had been viewed nearly 1.2 million times, the paper said.
The paper received a flood of angry phone calls and letters, and opponents posted the home address of editors and other staff members online. The reaction prompted the paper to hire armed security for its headquarters and for a bureau in Rockland.
The new gun law, which Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo signed on Tuesday, includes a provision prohibiting the release of information on gun permit holders for 120 days, and it also allows those with permits already in the statewide database to request the removal of their names and addresses.
State Senator Greg Ball, a Putnam County Republican and a sponsor of the provision, applauded the map's removal. ''I am proud to have passed legislation keeping The Journal News from doing this ever again,'' he said.
In a note to readers published on Friday, Ms. Hasson said the decision to remove the interactive map, which was posted in response to the mass shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., was neither a concession to critics nor a response to threats. ''We know our business is a controversial one, and we do not cower,'' she said.
She said the paper would continue to pursue its request for permit records from Putnam County. Local officials have so far declined to release them.
Ms. Hasson said a snapshot of the map -- with its dots visible but personal information absent -- would also remain on the site, ''to remind the community that guns are a fact of life we should never forget.''

Investing In Guns

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA. 
Charles M. Blow is off today.

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; OP-ED COLUMNIST; Pg. 17

LENGTH: 831 words

In 2006, Cerberus Capital Management, the private equity firm run by the secretive financier Steven Feinberg, set out to raise $6.5 billion in a new fund called Cerberus Institutional Partners Series IV. Feinberg's reputation for extracting value from troubled companies -- by replacing management, shuttering facilities and creating ''efficiencies'' -- was such that by May 2007, when the fund was finally closed, it had gotten commitments for nearly $1 billion more than it had sought.
Cerberus Institutional Partners Series IV is the fund that took over Chrysler in 2007. It bought General Motors' financing arm, now called Ally Financial. It gobbled up hospitals, purchased bus companies, and even bought the raunchy magazine Maxim. 
It is also the fund that bought Bushmaster Firearms, the company that made the assault weapon used by Adam Lanza to massacre 20 children and seven adults in Newtown, Conn., last month. It bought Remington Arms, the maker of the pump-action shotgun that was among the guns James Holmes used to kill 12 people and wound 58 in Aurora, Colo. It bought a handful of other firearms companies, which it then merged into a new parent company, Freedom Group. At which point, Cerberus was the largest manufacturer of guns and ammunition in the country.
Not long ago, I obtained a partial list of the institutional investors that committed money to the Cerberus fund. One of the investors, the California State Teachers' Retirement System, which put in $500 million, has already announced that it will divest its gun holdings. ''We shouldn't be investing in things like that,'' says Bill Lockyer, the California state treasurer. He noted that assault weapons are illegal in California.
Most of the other big investors, however, have kept their heads down. TIAA-CREF, the financial services giant, committed $147.8 million to the Series IV fund. (''No comment,'' said a spokesman.) The State of Wisconsin Investment Board put up $100 million. The University of Texas endowment made a $75 million commitment; the Regents of the University of California kicked in $40 million; the University of Missouri endowment was an investor. So were the Los Angeles Fire and Police Pension system, the Indiana Public Retirement System, and the Pennsylvania Public School Employees' Retirement System (which kicked in $400 million). And plenty of others.
When I called these investors to ask their rationale for investing in a fund that financed a gun ''roll-up,'' as the Cerberus strategy is called, I got three main responses. The first was that the percentage of their investment that went to Freedom Group was minuscule. ''We have a very small investment in Bushmaster, which translates to about $1 million,'' said Dianne Klein, a spokeswoman for the University of California system. (She added that the California system was going to divest its gun holdings.) Jennifer Hollingshead at the University of Missouri told me that the endowment's exposure was less than $450,000 -- ''which represents about 0.01 percent of our total portfolio.''
The second response was that, as limited partners, the institutional investors didn't have a say in how Cerberus invested the money. The fact that Feinberg decided to buy companies whose guns have repeatedly been used for mass slaughter was, in effect, his decision to make.
The third was that the core duty of a pension fund or university endowment is to maximize returns. Nobody made this point more vehemently than Bruce Zimmerman, a spokesman for the University of Texas Investment Management Company. ''We have no plans to divest,'' he said. ''We invest strictly on economic considerations, and we do not take into account social and political consideration.''
Cerberus never tried to hide what it was doing. And why would it? It was proud of its gun strategy. It held annual meetings with its investors and talked freely about Freedom Group. Investors were also aware that in 2010, Cerberus had tried (and failed) to take Freedom Group public.
But until Newtown, none of the investors gave the business a second's thought. Aurora, Fort Hood, Wisconsin -- and dozens of other mass slaughters -- came and went, and the investors stuck with Cerberus.
Newtown, it is often said, has changed that dynamic, sensitizing the country to the insanity of its gun laws, and giving gun control advocates hope that reform might finally be possible. But with the tragedy barely a month old, you can already feel the pushback. Supporters of the National Rifle Association in Congress are vowing to resist any effort to tighten the nation's gun laws. Gun-friendly state legislators are pushing absurd laws aimed at pre-empting federal gun legislation. And then there are the investors, who have a unique ability to push companies to change, if they so choose. (Just recall the South African boycott.)
What I learned this week is that, Newtown notwithstanding, too many of them have other priorities. Making money is still more important that saving lives.

President Obama begins his second term on Sunday with Americans cautiously optimistic about both the years ahead and his stewardship, but more polarized politically than four years ago and with less lofty hopes.
After a first term of both big achievements and disappointments and the economy still struggling to recover from the financial crisis he inherited, Mr. Obama retains the approval of a slim majority of Americans, 51 percent, according to a pre-inauguration survey for The New York Times and CBS News. That is down from 62 percent soon after he took office four years ago, and conceals a sharp divide: 8 in 10 Republicans disapprove of how he is handling the job, while almost 9 in 10 Democrats approve. Independents are split.
The public's approval of Mr. Obama's job performance is similar to George W. Bush's rating at the start of his second term. But it is lower than the standings for the previous two-term presidents, Bill Clinton (60 percent) and Ronald Reagan (62 percent), who served in less polarized times. 
Still, Mr. Obama is in a considerably stronger position as he opens his second term, especially relative to the increasingly unpopular Republicans in Congress. The percentage of Americans who disapprove of Congress -- 82 percent -- is the highest for a new Congress since The Times and CBS News began asking the question regularly two decades ago. While neither party in Congress gets high marks, the public is far more negative toward Republican lawmakers.
That negativity appears to be causing introspection among some top Republicans. After a retreat this week in which they heard bad news from their own pollsters, House Republicans announced that they would agree to an unconditional three-month increase in the nation's debt limit without equal spending cuts immediately -- a tactical retreat that most likely reflects their sense of their disadvantage against Mr. Obama.
Nearly half the public blames Republicans for the partisan impasse that nearly blocked a needed tax agreement over the holidays, compared with almost one-third who blame Mr. Obama. Independents sided with the president by a two-to-one ratio. Almost half of Americans said the episode made them more pessimistic about Washington's ability to resolve other problems in the future.
More broadly, Americans remain deeply concerned about the state of the country. Only 38 percent said it was on the right track, compared with 57 percent calling it on the wrong track. Nearly a decade has passed since more people viewed the country on the right track than the wrong.
As for the next fiscal confrontation -- over a longer-term increase in the nation's debt limit, which is essential for the government to borrow to pay existing obligations -- the poll had some of its only good news for Republicans. Six in 10 Americans say the borrowing limit should not be raised without the White House and Congress also approving cuts in spending -- which had been the Republicans' position before their retreat -- while just 17 percent say the limit should be increased without conditions, which is Mr. Obama's stance.
''Unless the Republicans hold fast and say, 'Come to the table and give us cuts and a budget,' the Democrats will keep saying, 'We'll do it later,' '' said John Asam, 47, an unemployed Republican in Downey, Calif.
While a majority continues to disapprove of Mr. Obama's handling of annual deficits, 54 percent to 37 percent, Americans favor by about two to one his call to both cut spending and increase taxes instead of cutting spending only, as Republicans would.
''I side with the president on social issues, but I do think it's important to be moderate on financial issues,'' said Anna Kroncke, 33, a psychologist and political independent in Denver who voted for Mr. Obama both times. ''That's where it might be really helpful to compromise with the Republicans.''
But the poll holds other signs that the public sees Mr. Obama as having greater leverage than Republicans. Six in 10 say Mr. Obama will have more influence over the next four years, compared with almost 3 in 10 who say Republicans will hold sway.
''I think Barack Obama will have more influence than the Republicans in Congress because the mood of the nation has changed,'' said Sandy Brassard, 52, an independent who is a music teacher in San Francisco. ''I'm not sure what will happen with the budget and the debt, but I am very optimistic about gun control and immigration and gay marriage and even Social Security because of his stance and the mood of the country.''
More Americans say that they trust the president over Republicans in Congress to make the right decisions about the economy, budget deficits and taxes -- the fiscal issues that could dominate Mr. Obama's next term. Half favor him on those issues, while about one-third say they trust Republicans more.
On the more recent issue to join the nation's list of priorities, dealing with gun violence, not quite half say they trust Mr. Obama over Republicans; 47 percent choose the president and 39 percent Republicans.
On illegal immigration, the other issue that Mr. Obama promises to address this year, almost 7 in 10 say they are confident about the president's ability to deal with the matter. And significant majorities, including most Democrats and independents, also express confidence about Mr. Obama's ability to make the right decisions regarding Afghanistan, protecting the United States from a terrorist attack and the economy.
Now a president with a record instead of a newcomer, Mr. Obama has seen his favorability among Americans tarnish a bit. Four years ago, 6 in 10 had a favorable opinion, about 1 in 10 did not and 3 in 10 reserved judgment. Now about one-third of the country has an unfavorable view of him, though a plurality -- 46 percent -- retains a favorable opinion.
Mr. Obama's resilience despite continued high unemployment and partisan battling partly reflects that twice as many Americans continue to blame his predecessor, Mr. Bush, for the state of the economy. More also blame Wall Street, and about the same number fault Congress as Mr. Obama.
By 48 percent to 22 percent, Americans approve of his cabinet picks, despite criticism that he has favored white men, with women no less approving than men. Four years ago, Mr. Obama's cabinet choices were supported 71 percent to 22 percent.
As for much of his presidency, significantly more Americans favor his handling of foreign policy than disapprove. And more continue to disapprove of his record on the economy than approve of it, though the margin has narrowed to a statistically insignificant one as the recovery has picked up. Just 42 percent expect the economy to be better in four years than it is today.
The nationwide poll was conducted Jan. 11-15 with 1,110 adults, using land lines and cellphones, and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.

New Violence in Belfast May Be About More Than the Flag

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 4

BELFAST, Northern Ireland -- For more than six weeks, it has been a dismal case of back-to-the-future, a crudely sectarian upheaval that has defied all attempts at peacemaking.
The scenes recall the sectarian bitterness that infused the 30 years of virtual civil war known as the Troubles: night after night of street protests marshaled by balaclava-wearing militants, who have updated their tactics by using social media to rally mobs; death threats to prominent politicians, some of whom have fled their homes and hidden under police guard; firebombs, flagstones and rocks hurled at churches, police cars and lawmakers' offices; protesters joined by rock-throwing boys of 8 and 9; neighborhoods sealed off for hours by the police or protesters' barricades.
Many had hoped that the old hatreds between Northern Ireland's two main groups -- the mainly Protestant, pro-British unionists, and the mainly Roman Catholic republicans, with their commitment to a united Ireland -- would recede permanently under the auspices of the Good Friday agreement. That accord was reached 15 years ago as a blueprint for the power-sharing government that now rules the province. 
But the fragility of those hopes has been powerfully demonstrated by more than 40 days and nights of violence that were triggered by a decision to cut back on the flying of the Union Jack, Britain's red, white and blue national flag, over the grandly pillared, neo-Classical pile City Council building in central Belfast.
By the latest count, more than 100 police officers have been injured, along with dozens of protesters and bystanders. At times, the violence has expanded to other cities, including Londonderry. Business has slumped. Police commanders, their forces overwhelmed, have assigned dozens of officers to scan hundreds of hours of closed-circuit video, looking for ringleaders.
The crisis began modestly enough. The Belfast council, its pro-British members outvoted by a coalition of republicans and a small liberal bloc, decided in early December to limit the flag flying to 18 days a year, as specified by London for all of Britain. Through the decades when the council was dominated by Protestant unionists, committed to links with Britain, the flag flew from the pinnacle of the building every day of the year.
Incongruously, perhaps, most of those 18 days do not represent landmarks in Britain's history -- Nelson's victory at Trafalgar, say, or Germany's surrender in the Second World War -- but the birthdays of Queen Elizabeth II and her family members, including the former Kate Middleton, now the Duchess of Cambridge, on whose 31st birthday, Jan. 9, the Belfast flag fluttered for the first time since it came down in early December. Under Britain's strict rules about flying the national standard on public and private buildings, not even the Parliament buildings in London fly it on any but government-designated days. But the hauling down of the Belfast flag provoked a furious reaction, the most protracted period of unrest in many years in Northern Ireland.
Among pro-British loyalists, the episode was seen as part of the step-by-step erosion of the British presence, a stripping of what many of them call their identity. Other examples they invoke have also been symbolic, including moves to delete the word Ulster -- an ancient designation for the northern Irish provinces commonly used by Protestants but mostly shunned by republicans -- from the formal names of the province's police force and its military reservists, and to remove the British crown emblem from the cap and shoulder badges of prison guards and other public officials.
But many of the province's political commentators see the flag dispute as a token of something more profound and ultimately more threatening to the hopes for a permanent peace here.
They say the council's decision on the flag, made possible by the fact that nationalists now hold 24 seats on the council, compared with 21 for the unionists, reflects the rapid growth of the Catholic population in the years since the Good Friday agreement, unsettling the long-held assumption among unionists that Protestants would constitute a permanent majority in the province.
The most recent census results, released last year, showed that 48 percent listed themselves as Protestant or brought up Protestant, down 5 percentage points from the 2001 census, while 45 percent of the population listed themselves as Catholic or brought up Catholic, a 1 percentage point rise. In Belfast, many say, Catholics are already a majority or nearly so and could form a majority across the province within a decade.
Since the Good Friday agreement specified that the province would remain part of Britain as long as a majority of the province's people and of the population of the whole of Ireland wished it to be, the reasoning goes, Protestants who are resolved never to accept a united Ireland could be right in seeing the flag dispute as a harbinger of their worst fears.
Patricia MacBride, a Catholic whose father was killed by loyalist gunmen and who has been a leader in reconciliation efforts under the Good Friday agreement, said she had always feared that the peace process might founder when Protestants realized that the population numbers were moving against them. With the sense that power was shifting away from them, she said, the sense of betrayal among Protestants had intensified.
''There was always going to be something that triggered this upheaval,'' she said. ''Increasingly, they feel abandoned by the state whose agents they have been for so long.''
Strong backing for that view was evident on a recent morning in Belfast on Shankill Road, a depressingly run-down loyalist stronghold notorious as a center of sectarian ambushes, bombings and shootings during the Troubles. There the Union Jack was everywhere, atop buildings, in shop windows, in tattoos and in the hands of small children out shopping with their parents. In bars, cafes and shops, ''the humiliation'' of the flag issue was the center of conversation. In the winter chill, groups of men, mostly unemployed, reinforced one another's indignation.
On a stretch of the road punctuated with memorials to Protestants killed in the Troubles and to Ulstermen who died in World War I, Paul Shaw, 33, owner of the Shankill Band Shop, boasted of doing a roaring trade during the upheaval, selling thousands of flags and other loyalist memorabilia, including DVDs of patriotic songs sung by Ulstermen on the battlefields of the Somme.
''It's our flag, our identity; it's been flown above City Hall every day since 1906, and it's being stripped from us,'' he said. With nods from others clustered around him, he compared the flag battle to the fighting on the Somme. ''If we lose this one, we'll have a united Ireland in 5 or 10 years, and we won't accept it,'' he said. ''We'll die to defend the flag. If we have to, we'll go back to the graveyards and the jails.''
With no end in sight, leaders of the power-sharing government have voiced anxiety that the protests, by whipping up antagonism among Protestants, could threaten the peace process. But the top two officials in the power-sharing administration -- Peter Robinson, the unionist first minister, and Martin McGuinness, the republican first deputy minister, who is Mr. Robinson's effective coequal -- vowed in the province's assembly on Monday that their commitment to the peace agreement would not be shaken. Mr. Robinson was unsparing in his rebuke to the protesters. ''You do not respect the union flag if you are using it as a weapon,'' he said, adding that the protests were ''a cynical cover for the real political agenda, which is to destroy the political process.''
Mr. McGuinness, a former chief of staff of the Irish Republican Army, seemed eager not to draw sectarian comfort from the turmoil in the unionists' political base.
''I do not believe for a moment that they speak for the vast majority of unionists,'' he said of the flag protesters, dismissing their efforts as a crude challenge to the power-sharing arrangements ''from people who do not have a mandate and speak for nobody but themselves.''

Advice for Obama's Speech

SECTION: Section SR; Column 0; Sunday Review Desk; ROOM FOR DEBATE; Pg. 7

LENGTH: 2793 words

On Monday, President Obama will stand before the United States Capitol to give his second Inaugural speech to the nation.
What issues should he address and what tone should he adopt? Should he channel Lincoln, Martin Luther King or F.D.R.? Should he talk of partisan politics or propose policy initiatives?
Avoid the Lincoln Quote
By William Kristol 
William Kristol is the editor of The Weekly Standard.
I suspect that in his second Inaugural Address President Obama won't be able to resist quoting the only other second Inaugural delivered by a president from Illinois. And proud as he is of getting us out of Iraq and anticipating as he does withdrawing from Afghanistan, President Obama may be particularly tempted to quote Lincoln's famous quatrain:
Fondly do we hope -- Fervently do we pray -- That this mighty scourge of war May speedily pass away.
So do we all hope and pray. But this prayer is preceded in Lincoln's speech by his prosaic citing of "the progress of our arms, upon which all else chiefly depends." That progress, Lincoln says, has been "reasonably satisfactory and encouraging to all." It's the progress of arms that makes a just and lasting peace possible. There is no substitute for military strength. There's no substitute for military victory.
President Obama likes to say that "the tide of war is receding." But war doesn't ebb and flow like a tide. Wars are won or lost. President Obama may already have squandered victory in Iraq by failing to secure the peace with a continued deployment of American troops. He would compound this error by squandering the achievements of the surge in Afghanistan -- a surge of troops and of fighting that he ordered -- by insisting on a precipitate and almost complete withdrawal from that theater of conflict. And he would endanger the chances of a broader and more lasting peace, one vouchsafed by American military might (as well, of course, as American economic strength and diplomatic engagement), by presiding over a hollowing-out of the American military.
Fondly do I hope -- fervently do I pray -- that President Obama chooses a better way. And that in his second term he doesn't shrink from the tough-minded and hard-headed policies that could truly achieve a just and lasting peace with all nations.

Renew Faith in the American Dream
By Douglas Brinkley
Douglas Brinkley is a professor of history at Rice University and a commentator for CBS News. He is the author of ''The Wilderness Warrior'' and the editor of ''The Reagan Diaries.''
If Barack Obama's first Inauguration was a paean for increased civic responsibility, his second should be an optimistic romp aimed at renewing faith in the American Dream. Not only will the president be orating on Martin Luther King Day, but 2013 also marks both the 50th anniversary of the ''I Have A Dream'' speech and the 150th anniversary of Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation.
History, he should remind us, teaches that our own times aren't uniquely oppressive. America, in fact, has an astonishing record of triumph in the face of seemingly insurmountable adversity. We've overcome slavery, world wars, financial depression and Jim Crow by believing fully in the tenets of liberty -- inherent in the U.S. Constitution, Bill of Rights and Declaration of Independence. And now, in the second decade of the 21st century, America must confront a new series of threats to our liberty.
Playing off Franklin D. Roosevelt's 1937 second Inaugural -- a masterpiece of progressive speechcraft -- Obama should remind citizens that comfort and obstructionism and disunity have no useful place in our democracy. The fear index is too high in America today. No parent should have to worry that their child will be murdered by assault weapons when attending school. No Latino should think that a knock-on-the-door means deportation. No worker should fear that Social Security will be raided or health care benefits incrementally stripped away under a desire for a balanced budget. And no citizen in the Age of Climate Change should wonder whether the federal government will help them rebuild if a natural disaster devastates their community.
Everybody will be expecting Obama to quote from Lincoln and King. He should. But he would be wise to squeeze in an uplifting line from Cesar Chavez (Latino rights) or Eleanor Roosevelt (human dignity) or Susan B. Anthony (voting power). It's important to enlarge the pantheon of social justice warriors in America beyond the rote obvious.
Back in 1937, F.D.R. said that, ''The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.'' I hope the president speaks out fiercely for the 30 million in poverty, the unemployed, the downtrodden and the middle-class families that just can't make ends meet. If one American is hungry, he should say, than we're all hungry.
Striking a bipartisan tone he should remind us that America is a work-in-progress, never complete, as long as social and economic justice remains unattainable for fellow citizens. While the Inauguration is not the forum to lay out a comprehensive plan for tax reform, spending cuts and investments, he should remind us that everybody must pay their fair share for our country to prosper. Bugling a better-days-are-coming message, he should ask for Divine Guidance and, as he did so effectively in 2008, once again chant: Si, se puede (yes we can)!

Acknowledge the Divisions
By Jeff Shesol
Jeff Shesol, a deputy chief speechwriter to President Bill Clinton, is a partner at a communications strategy firm. He is the author of ''Supreme Power: Franklin Roosevelt vs. the Supreme Court."
The occasion seems less momentous because it is: continuity rather than change, ''let us continue'' instead of ''let us begin.'' A second Inaugural Address -- Lincoln's being the great exception -- tends to be a weak echo of the first (and few of those, in truth, are worth a reprise). President Obama, though, has a chance on Monday to give a speech that is stronger, snappier and ultimately more memorable than the sober summons to ''responsibility'' he delivered four years ago. To do it he will, however, have to forsake Abraham Lincoln, whose ideal of national unity he has repeatedly evoked.
''Unity'' is as consistent a theme as one can find in Inaugural Addresses. And for good reason: we are, in fact, a union, even if we do a pretty imperfect job of showing it. For Barack Obama that ideal has always held a special meaning: when he arrived on the national stage in 2004 and when he ran for president in 2008, he seemed, to many Americans, to embody the notion that we can -- despite all appearances -- come together across lines of division (black and white, red state and blue).
His first Inaugural made the point plainly, asserting a ''unity of purpose'' in the nation and proclaiming an end to "the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long." In fact, it was less an end than an intermission, and within a day or two the Republican Party had picked itself up, dusted itself off and recommenced consuming us with stale political arguments.
Still, for a time -- a troublingly long time -- Barack Obama seemed to be the only person in Washington who held to a belief that the two sides could "do big things" (other than wage big battles) together. It was not until the blown grand bargain of 2011 that he finally abandoned his ''post-partisan'' ideal. In 2012, he ran for re-election not as a uniter but a fighter. And in recent weeks he's maintained that posture -- on guns, on the fiscal cliff, on the debt ceiling.
An Inaugural Address should never be sharp in tone. But it can and should show some steel. Gauzy appeals to national unity would serve in Obama's case to underscore the almost willful naivetי of much of his first term. To make this address meaningful, he needs to acknowledge the very real and deeply felt differences between the parties. This is one of the central and chronic facts of our national existence, and President Obama will do himself no favors by minimizing it as he did four years ago, and for too long thereafter.
The question for Obama now -- not just in this speech but in the course it charts for his second term -- is not what he will do to heal our divisions. It's what he can achieve despite them.

Revive the Spirit of Unity
By Linda Chavez
Linda Chavez was the director of public liaison in the Reagan White House and the G.O.P. Senate nominee from Maryland in 1986. She is the chairwoman of the Center for Equal Opportunity, a conservative research group focused on race and ethnicity.
President Obama could do worse in his second Inaugural Address than dust off a copy of the speech he gave to the 2004 Democratic Convention, which arguably got him where he is today. For those of us used to listening to invectives against the opposition at conventions, then-Senator Obama's tone was refreshing.
''There's not a liberal America and a conservative America; there's the United States of America,'' he said. ''The pundits like to slice and dice our country into red states and blue states: red states for Republicans, blue States for Democrats. But I've got news for them, too. We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America.''
Whatever happened to that Barack Obama? Some of my conservative friends would say it was all an act -- that he was always a hyper-partisan. Certainly they have ample evidence in recent days to buttress their opinion. In his press conference this week, the president excoriated Republicans. ''If congressional Republicans refuse to pay America's bills on time, Social Security checks and veterans benefits will be delayed,'' he warned. He also suggested, ''some of the House Republicans'' are ''suspicious about Social Security. They have suspicions about whether government should make sure that kids in poverty are getting enough to eat.''
At the moment it looks like the president's agenda for his second term is to beat the Republicans into submission by demonizing them with the American people. It's a goal unworthy of a president -- and I'd still like to think he's better than that. But it will take humility (not an attribute that comes naturally to him) to admit that he cannot solve the enormous challenges that face a nation buried in debt without working with Republicans.
He once deplored the ''politics of cynicism.'' Let him prove he still does by abandoning his own contempt for those fellow patriots who don't always agree with him.

What I'd Like to Hear, But Won't
By Michael C. Dawson
Michael C. Dawson is the John D. MacArthur professor of political science and the director of the Center for the Study of Race, Politics and Culture at the University of Chicago. He is the author of the forthcoming "Blacks In and Out of the Left."
At Monday's Inauguration, we might hear President Obama announce a new policy outlining a road to citizenship for immigrants to this country. He could call for a return to the dynamic immigration policies that allowed European immigration and that led to the extraordinary economic and intellectual growth during the 19th and early 20th centuries. He could say that we need to correct the racist immigration ideas and policies of that period that led to, for example, the Chinese Exclusion Acts.
He could also remind us that we mistakenly romanticize that period. Jewish, Catholic, Irish, Italian and East European immigrants were viewed with suspicion and considered by many to be inherently corrupting of the American way of life and in need of ''civilizing'' because of their heretical and dangerous ideas and religions. Some of these European populations were not even considered white on arrival.
Yet, somehow we not only survived that foreign ''invasion,'' but prospered economically and intellectually from it. He could call on the country to embrace that spirit which enabled the country to grow and prosper, and welcome this era's populations from around the world that seek to make a better life for themselves and in the process make the country much stronger and more viable.
We might also hear President Obama take a long overdue more combative tone as he pursues a wide range of policy objectives on the domestic front as he has finally done with gun control. He might point to the increasing number of natural disasters as a clarion call for a more aggressive and comprehensive policy on climate change. We might hear some echoes of these concerns in his speech, but probably not to the degree his supporters would wish.
It is unlikely, however, that he will even moderately pursue economic justice and growth as his 2008 supporters thought he would. Unfortunately, I doubt we'll hear him call for the strengthening of the New Deal and Great Society that were the crowning legacies of the 20th century Democratic Party. We will probably not hear about the introduction of economic policies that will lead to full employment and a repair of our social safety net. Nor will we hear him call for Americans to realize that we are responsible for each other and must pay a fair share of taxes to support those who are unable to support themselves. Alarmingly, we will not hear that he will live up to his 2008 pledge to close Guantanamo, or begin to restore the civil liberties that have been under attack now for two administrations within this country, or return to the rule of law in our pursuit of national security.
His supporters will hear some of what they wish to see over the next four years. But the reality is that much of the hope that was generated in 2008 will prove to be unfulfilled.

Talk About the Role of Government
By Drew Westen
Drew Westen is a professor of psychology and psychiatry at Emory University. He the author of ''The Political Brain: The Role of Emotion in Deciding the Fate of the Nation.''
For the last 30 years, Americans have heard one primary narrative about government: that government is the problem, not the solution. That was Ronald Reagan's mantra, it has been the mantra of Republicans for over three decades. It is so engrained in political discourse that Democrats have been too afraid to contest it.
President Obama had little to say about government in his first inaugural address. The absence of government regulation over the most influential and least productive sector of the economy -- the financial sector, which manufactures nothing but instability if not kept closely in check -- toppled the economy and decimated the lives of millions of Americans, just as it had done 80 years earlier during the Great Depression. Yet the president was largely silent about the role of government in preventing abuses of power by the few that affect the many, let alone its role in creating the conditions for prosperity and economic growth, by maintaining a modern infrastructure, laws that protect ever-changing ideas, products and industries, and laws and regulations that protect the wages and benefits of working people against unfair labor practices often perpetrated under the name of ''free trade.'' President Obama once spoke with tremendous eloquence about government in an address at the University of Michigan, but otherwise, he has had little to say about good government. The result is that Americans continue to hear only one side of the argument, and they have come to distrust government still further as it has become infested with the interests of big business, which overwhelm policy decisions unless an event so momentous as the Newtown massacre of 20 innocent children allows public opinion a momentary chance of prevailing over the special interests that buy and sell elections like commodities traded in unregulated markets.
If this president wants a legacy, which he does, the time is now to set the stage for it with an address befitting his eloquence, one that dispels the notion that the measure of a government is its size -- and that unlike virtually everything else in the American psyche, smaller is better. The measure of a government is whether it helps create prosperity for the many, security for all, and a better world for our children.

Closing Gun-Sale Loophole Rises on Agenda

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 22

LENGTH: 889 words

WASHINGTON -- As Senate Democrats grapple with how much of President Obama's broad gun control agenda is politically achievable, or even desirable, Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, chairman of the committee with jurisdiction over gun laws, said that moving to tighten background checks should be a top priority.
''One of the first things you want to do is close the gun-show loophole,'' said Mr. Leahy, in an interview for C-SPAN's ''Newsmakers,'' referring to a legal provision that permits unlicensed gun sellers to sell to people without conducting background checks. The loophole is a small piece of a much broader agenda introduced by Mr. Obama on Wednesday, one that faces considerable, though not insurmountable, odds on Capitol Hill. 
The view of Mr. Leahy, a Democrat with a history of supporting some gun rights, is crucial because the work of his Judiciary Committee will be central to advancing any new gun legislation.
He declined to detail precisely how the committee, which will hold hearings on potential gun legislation this month, would proceed with Mr. Obama's request to push legislation that includes a renewal of an assault weapons ban, a limit on magazine size and universal background checks.
Mr. Leahy's plans will also be closely watched by senators with their own gun control legislative agendas, lawmakers who may decide to push their own bills if the committee process does not yield the results they seek.
The 2004 expiration of the assault weapons ban tipped off the beginning of a new era in gun rights, one in which legislation began to tilt in favor of laws that strengthened, rather than chipped away at, gun owners' rights to own all types of weapons, as well as where and how they could be carried. An attempt to renew that law, which opponents in both parties say did little to stem gun violence in the 10 years it was in effect, faces formidable opposition.
Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, who finds himself trapped between the desires of Mr. Obama and those of his conservative Democratic colleagues who would prefer not to have to vote on gun measures, has already signaled that that particular element of Mr. Obama's agenda is in trouble.
''Is it something that can pass the Senate?'' he said recently on a Nevada television program about a renewed assault weapons ban. ''Maybe. Is it something that can pass the House? I doubt it.''
Mr. Leahy said, ''I have told my staff I'd like to get a definitive answer if we can: 'Did an assault weapon ban work?' ''
It is a question that many Democrats and Republicans alike continue to pose.
It is possible that the Obama administration, which spent its first four years negotiating with Congress by offering its strongest hand up front, may use that legislation as a bargaining chip that it is willing to sacrifice to obtain the rest of its agenda.
Some Democrats, particularly Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, believe the best path to pursue is universal background checks for gun owners, which Mr. Schumer called ''the sweet spot'' among legislative paths. But such legislation would be scrutinized carefully for its details.
For example, in many states and rural areas, guns frequently change hands privately through sales to family members or neighbors, which could complicate background check procedures. But if written narrowly, a background check provision could potentially win bipartisan support.
One of the clearest impediments to mass killings, gun control advocates say, is a limit on the size of magazines permitted for civilian gun owners. ''I've never known a gun owner in Vermont who says, 'No, I've got to have 30 rounds,' '' Mr. Leahy said.
A measure limiting magazines has been drawing bipartisan backing since the school massacre in Newtown, Conn. ''I'm going to support the limitation on the size of the clips,'' said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. Such a bill, narrowly written, ''might well pass,'' she said.
Senator Angus King of Maine, the newly elected Independent, has said that he supports universal background checks and limits on high-capacity ammunition magazines as well, but is waiting to see specific legislative language on all of the proposals, including an assault weapons ban.
The biggest problem may be marrying too many components in one bill. For example, a measure that Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, is working on would reinstitute the ban on assault weapons but also limit magazines. Such a measure would probably enjoy the support of some big-city mayors and the like, but could be met coolly by other Democrats, particularly those from conservative states who are up for re-election in 2014.
Any legislation that managed to get through the Senate would have a tougher ride in the House.
''The necessity of having that legislation here instead of in the states is lost on me,'' said Representative Rob Woodall, Republican of Georgia. ''Folks in New York may have less of that grandfather-to-grandson exchange that we have in Georgia that takes place under the Christmas tree every year.''
Mr. Leahy said legislation would be shaped after he heard from a range of witnesses in his hearings. He said he had invited Wayne LaPierre, the chief executive of the National Rifle Association.
The N.R.A. did not respond to an inquiry about whether Mr. LaPierre would attend.

Sheriff Andy Of Albany

WASHINGTON
WHEN he was a young henchman for his father in Albany, Andrew Cuomo gave intensity a bad name.
Now that he is New York's governor himself, Cuomo gives intensity a good name.
In the old days, that dark zeal was scattered around, directed at anyone who insulted or crossed him. Now he channels it more narrowly on the handful of things he wants to get done that he thinks the public wants.
''I was 23 years old then; now I'm 55 years old,'' he says with an air of the Stephen Sondheim classic ''I'm Still Here.'' ''I was a linear, focused person. Then I got knocked on my rear end. I went through professional and personal hell. So now I keep it very simple. One day at a time. I'm killing myself to do the best job I can as governor. I do what I'm supposed to do and forget about the unhealthy things that used to distract me. I put one foot in front of the other. We take on big problems. And to say there's no solution to the problems is not an option.'' 
Following the grotesque murders of children in Newtown, Conn., and firefighters in Webster, N.Y., the governor bellowed ''Stop the madness'' and shoved through tough gun-control legislation so blindingly fast that some state senators had scarcely read the bill, and the N.R.A. conceded that it had no time to thwart it.
Cuomo, who worked the phones every day for a month, straight through the holidays, to drum up support, dismisses criticism of rushing and secrecy: ''Everyone said, 'You did it so quickly.' That perspective is skewed. We're years and years late. The federal assault weapons ban had lapsed. The state assault weapons ban was on the books, but everybody knew it wasn't working. Government just failed to perform, and people died. So it's all bittersweet because I have to say to myself, maybe if we had done earlier what we were supposed to do, figured out how to overcome the politics of extremes, we could have saved all those lives.
''We should have done it as a prophylactic, but maybe it's human nature to tend to respond to an emergency. You have to sniffle before you get a flu shot.''
You could say it's not so hard to pass such a bill in a left-leaning state with a popular governor (he is floating at a 71 percent favorability rating), and that it's a far easier achievement than the gay marriage bill.
But with the president privately signaling some pessimism on new gun laws, as his domestic policy aides take a slower, less stringent approach, it's bracing to see somebody, anybody, actually make government hum.
Cuomo doesn't spend much time on TV baring his soul or hustling to get name recognition. (He doesn't need to.) He focuses-focuses-focuses on the matter at hand, and on proving that government can work -- if you apply the proper intensity at times of intense awareness.
''You have to try to hit a home run,'' he said. ''Home run hitters also have notoriously high strikeout rates. But it's like when we tried to pass marriage equality. You have to be willing to fail.''
On BuzzFeed, Blake Zeff said ''the latest unachievable triumph'' shows that Cuomo has ''a seemingly superhuman mastery of legislative politics.'' And The Daily News christened Cuomo ''America's Sheriff.''
''I'm psyched,'' Sheriff Andy said in a call from Albany, not Mayberry, joking, ''But I never really saw myself in a big cowboy hat.''
And there is always suspicion swirling: What is Andrew up to? He is always up to something, but is he really deserving of the ever-present assumption that self-advancement trumps his true beliefs? On gun control, was he driven to beat the White House to the punch -- or perhaps to beat a fellow governor and 2016 prospect, Martin O'Malley of Maryland? Was he pandering to the left to make up for centrist moves?
''Even when we're building a bridge,'' the governor noted dryly, ''opponents say, 'You're only building a bridge to run for president.' People are cynical about politicians. I'm the son of a politician, and I grew up in the political world, so people think I must be that -- on steroids.''
The N.R.A. and Greg Ball, a Republican state senator, denounced the New York law as a product of the governor's 2016 ambition, although it could hurt Candidate Cuomo in places like Nevada, Colorado and Florida.
The governor doesn't have the president's public magnetism. But Cuomo, who devotes a lot of time to wining, dining and wheedling legislators, is far more deft at carrots, sticks and baby-talk than President Obama is. It's a fascinating -- and open -- question about whether those skills could work the same way to jolt comatose Washington.
''It's more nuanced than carrots and sticks,'' the governor explained. ''People are complex. It's about the full panorama of relationships, the positive and negative. There's love, fear, desire to please, fear of reprisal. It's not a fist. I would much rather be home watching a ballgame. But it takes time. It takes effort. It's the job.''

Pursuing Many Paths to Find His Own

BYLINE: By BEN RATLIFF

THE singer Josי James's cool and confident new album, ''No Beginning No End,'' to be released by Blue Note next week, sounds like the result of the black-pop continuum, jazz and soul and hip-hop and R&B, slow-cooked for more than 50 years.
It descends from a lot of things. First among them are the great neo-soul records of 2000, D'Angelo's ''Voodoo'' and Erykah Badu's ''Mama's Gun.'' It's got the lagging relationships to the beat on the hip-hop records produced in the '90s and oughts by J Dilla; some of the ballad rumination in Stevie Wonder and Roberta Flack's records from the early and mid-'70s; the tempos of Sade, the vocal color of Gil Scott-Heron, the phrasing of Billie Holiday. 
Its parts don't have a clinically defined relationship, A + B + C. It's an evolved compound, and the album sounds evolved in other ways too. It definitely wants to be appreciated by adult women, with songs like ''It's All Over Your Body'' and ''Come to My Door'': the male soul singer representing sex and trust and ethics, sometimes in duets with calm, female voices -- the French-Moroccan Hindi Zahra on ''Sword + and Gun,'' the New Yorker Emily King on ''Heaven on the Ground.'' It's likely to have a following among musicians, especially through tracks like ''Vanguard,'' with the rhythm section of the pianist Robert Glasper, the bassist Pino Palladino and the drummer Chris Dave, who play an intricate Morse code of funk and negative space. (Mr. Palladino, one of the bassists and producers on ''No Beginning No End,'' played on the D'Angelo and Badu records; the engineer Russell Elevado, who recorded this one, recorded those too.)
Recorded in New York, Paris and London, the album is on a label famous for jazz, but this isn't jazz: no solos. It's got more live-band groove than most singer-songwriter music. It's a little too warm and inward to be considered R&B. It is not trendy music, but its stubborn nonchalance gives it a kind of originality.
''It doesn't feel like he's going for an older-singer kind of vibe,'' Mr. Glasper said. ''He is jazz. He doesn't have to walk around proving it. And very naturally he's a child of hip-hop and R&B. He's just breathing.''
I first saw Mr. James, 34, at the Thelonious Monk Jazz Competition eight years ago. He was small and compact and still relatively young, but his voice seemed bigger, deeper and older. He sang ''Every Day I Have the Blues,'' and he seemed to be referring to Joe Williams's sleek version from the mid-'50s. It was a centered and anxiety-free performance. His bearing implied that he didn't care whether you liked it or not. It killed the judges, including Jimmy Scott, who waved his hands in the air as if he were in church.
Mr. James had come from Minneapolis, the only contestant in the competition who hadn't gone to music school. The actor Billy Dee Williams, one of the M.C.'s, told him backstage that he ought to, which irritated him. ''I didn't have money to go to school,'' he told me a couple of weeks ago over lunch in Fort Greene, his Brooklyn neighborhood. ''It wasn't a choice.'' He didn't win, but he did go to the New School the next year, staying on to work in the equipment room when he ran out of tuition money.
Then things started to happen -- a slowly unfolding series of events routing him through Europe, distant associations with hip-hop and house music, a false start on a once-great jazz label and his current rehabilitation on another one. He has been meticulous this time, financing the recording of ''No Beginning No End,'' and presenting it to Blue Note as a fait accompli. ''Nothing was touched,'' he said proudly.
Mr. James grew up on the hip-hop and indie rock of the late '80s and early '90s: Ice Cube, Nirvana, the Pharcyde, Digable Planets. He is the son of a Panamanian jazz tenor saxophonist with the same name, though his father didn't raise him; he lived with his Irish-American mother in Duluth, Minn.; Seattle; and Minneapolis. He joined his Catholic-school choir at 14 when his voice changed, then dropped out of school and worked at odd jobs for a while. ''I had really fractured teen years,'' he said. ''It's hard to piece it all together.''
At 17 he moved back in with his mother and returned to school; his jobs gave him income to buy records. He did it methodically. First the basics, then a wide-angle understanding of the important labels, and then deep into single artists. (He spent $500 on Mosaic's 18-CD boxed set of the Nat King Cole Trio on Capitol Records, he said, and listened to nothing else for a month.) Around this time he wrote words to John Coltrane's solo on ''Equinox,'' to be sung in the vocalese tradition of Eddie Jefferson and Jon Hendricks. He shared his experiments with older musicians, the saxophonist Douglas Ewart and the pianist Carie Thomas, in Minneapolis, who had connections with Chicago's avant-garde jazz scene of the 1960s; he started playing with them and forming ideas about the entire arc of jazz history.
After graduating from high school he sought out a vocal teacher, who taught him opera technique but no repertory, just warm-ups and exercises. That was his only formal instruction, he said, besides records. Mr. James knows where his music comes from and speaks with specificity and certainty about what he's learned. He calls Billie Holiday's 1950s music on Verve, for example, ''the blueprint for 'Mama's Gun': where she sat in relation to the band, the way that the musicians supported her and the lines went through hers, Ben Webster and those guys playing counterpoint. She took her time. The whole behind-the-beat, J Dilla thing, she was all over that. She meant every word she sang. She took you to the pain right away.''
And also: ''She would reharmonize a line that sounded like it should have been written that way. And it's clear that her genius came from her community: she really got tight with her musicians. You hear, in rehearsal tapes, 'Try this, Billie,' and she'd sing it like that, and remember it.''
In 2006 he recorded a few tracks, including his vocal version of Coltrane's ''Equinox,'' with a band. He went to London for another singing competition, which he also didn't win, but handed out a lot of copies of his demo; one reached the BBC radio D.J. Gilles Peterson, who had become an important European taste maker, specifically where jazz meets electronic dance music. Mr. Peterson had started his own label, Brownswood, and they made two records together, ''The Dreamer'' and ''Blackmagic.'' The first, recorded in New York when Mr. James was still a student, sounds a lot closer to jazz, or his notion of it; the second was made more according to Mr. Peterson's ears, downtempo dance music with jazz harmony. Among its producers were Flying Lotus, the Los Angeles post-hip-hop producer, and Moodymann, the Detroit house musician.
Mr. James moved to London for a while, and he found an audience in Europe and Japan; he noted with satisfaction that instead of playing jazz clubs for 30 people he was playing spaces like the Paradiso in Amsterdam, a 1,000-capacity club where D'Angelo played last year. But Brownswood had no North American distribution, and it frustrated Mr. James that he had no career in his own country.
''Basically I just feel like it was my image, you know?'' he said. ''Nobody knew what to do with me. It was either 'You look like a rapper' ''-- he wears a Yankees cap over a stencil pattern cut into his short hair -- ''or, if I'm singing standards, 'It's not Michael Bublי, it's not pop, it's not easy enough to sell.' '' He played an excellent set at the Charlie Parker Jazz Festival in Harlem a few years ago with Junior Mance, one of his New School teachers, singing blues and standards, but that wasn't quite him. He played at the Blue Note with McCoy Tyner, singing songs from the album ''John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman,'' but that wasn't quite him either. He briefly signed to Verve, the label that once released most of the Coltrane records he loved, but that resulted in ''For All We Know,'' a drowsy duet album of standards with the Dutch pianist Jef Neve; it won awards in France but didn't sound convincing here.
So he's back, reinvented at Square 1. He has great young jazz musicians in his band, including the pianist Kris Bowers, but you won't see him playing at jazz clubs, if he can help it. (He'll perform at the Highline Ballroom next Wednesday.) Before long you may not see him in New York at all. ''That sense of New York being the hub for artists is gone,'' he said. ''More and more, people are saying Berlin is cool, Paris is cool, Marrakesh is cool. My label's here, my musicians are here. But I'm not going to stay here forever.''

WE often hear that comedy is universal -- that laughter is the common language, transcending cultural barriers -- but in fact it may be the most difficult genre to export. A pratfall is a pratfall, but anything more advanced requires a sense of cultural context and an instinctive understanding of local norms. Hence a film like Dany Boon's ''Bienvenue Chez les Ch'tis,'' a comedy that broke box office records in France when it was released in 2008, barely made a ripple elsewhere. (Its humor focused on cultural differences between the sunny south of the Midi and the leaden-skied economic devastation of northern France.) An announced American remake with Will Smith appears to have vanished into the turnaround ether.
I'm reminded of this by the appearance, thanks to the enterprising Oklahoma independent distributor VCI Entertainment, of two volumes announcing a series of classic British comedies starring two of England's most beloved performers, Will Hay (1888-49) and Norman Wisdom (1915-2010). These are not names to conjure with in the United States, and never really have been (although Wisdom did appear in Broadway shows). 
It's suggestive that most of the British comics who have prospered here come from the upper-class, Oxbridge tradition -- performers like the original ''Beyond the Fringe'' troupe (Alan Bennett, Peter Cook, Dudley Moore and Jonathan Miller), the long-running team of Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie, the Rowan Atkinson of ''Blackadder'' (if not of ''Mr. Bean''), most members of Monty Python and most recently the actor-provocateur Sacha Baron Cohen. It's also suggestive that they found their American success largely through PBS, which has long specialized in marketing British class distinctions to American audiences.
In PBS terms, if the Pythons are the ultimate ''Upstairs'' comedians, Hay and Wisdom (as well as other homegrown favorites like Arthur Askey, George Formby and Tommy Trinder) are definitely ''Downstairs'' -- the working class of British popular culture. These were personalities, forged not on the playing fields of Eton but in the rough-and-tumble world of the music hall. It's not as if Americans lack proletarian comics of our own, thanks to our parallel tradition of vaudeville and burlesque. But Hay and Wisdom definitely deserve another look, as strongly defined personalities who assumed creative control of the films in which they appeared.
At first it's difficult to warm to Hay, whose character was that of a prickly, small-time authoritarian, sputtering and stammering as he tries to bluff his way out of situations that have escaped his minimal control, his aspirations represented by the fussy pince-nez glasses that never seem to sit quite straight on his nose. The first of the VCI volumes of Hay's films (two more are set to follow next month) contains the 1935 ''Boys Will Be Boys,'' in which he reprises the blustery schoolmaster role that had made his music hall reputation, and the 1936 ''Where There's a Will,'' with Hays as a small-time lawyer who unwittingly provides cover for an attempted robbery.
Hay's closest American analogue is probably W. C. Fields, and it is said that Hay, who had trained as an engineer (and maintained a lifelong interest in aviation and astronomy), was inspired to try his hand at show business when he saw Fields's famous comic juggling act in a London theater. Both ''Boys'' and ''Will'' were directed by William Beaudine (as were several other Hay films), who had directed Fields in ''The Old Fashioned Way'' in 1934.
If Hay is ultimately sympathetic, it's because, like Fields, he never quite succeeds in disguising his essentially childish nature. There's always a part of him that would rather be playing gambling games with his students, or sneaking down to the pub with his subordinates. His films are a continuous revelation of the elaborate deception that is adulthood, and in his greatest works (not here, but in later movies like ''Oh, Mr. Porter!'' and ''Where's That Fire?'' -- both directed by Marcel Varnel -- there is a drunken delight in the breakdown of order that is about as far from PBS's imperial view of Britain as it is possible to get.
Where Hay cultivated his abrasiveness, Wisdom -- whose emergence as a star coincided with the coronation of Elizabeth II, and Britain's emergence from a postwar culture of shortages and rationing -- exhibits a need to be loved that approaches the intensity of Jerry Lewis. Himself the victim of a miserable childhood (abused by his alcoholic father, his mother abandoned the family, leaving Norman to raise himself on the streets), Wisdom developed a character he called the Gump -- a little man in an ill-fitting suit, with a boyish cloth cap always cocked to one side -- that seems an explicit homage to Chaplin (who returned the compliment by calling Wisdom his ''favorite clown'').
Where Hay dramatized his conflict with authority as an interior struggle (his best self versus his worst), Wisdom confronted the bosses of Britain's emerging entrepreneurial class: the department store manager of ''Trouble in Store'' (Wisdom's first starring feature, from 1953), or the ruthless real estate developer who wants to displace an orphanage in ''One Good Turn'' (1955), both directed by John Paddy Carstairs and both in the first volume of Wisdom films from VCI.
A natural athlete (he had been a boxing champion in the British Navy), Wisdom brought a balletic grace and control to his vocabulary of pratfalls and stumbles, the shyness of his character masking (as in Mr. Lewis) the self-assurance of a complete professional. He was also possessed of a beautifully soft, sweet singing voice, which in ''Trouble in Store'' he uses to serenade the leading lady (Moira Lister, who he loves but she does not love him) with a ballad he partly wrote, ''Don't Laugh at Me 'Cause I'm a Fool.''
The moment is a naked play for pathos, but resistance is futile in the face of Wisdom's precisely calculated delivery, as when he drops, for the space of two or three bars, from a singing to a speaking voice to convey the personal dimension of his declaration. No Oxbridge irony here: this is a direct expression of needfulness and vulnerability, deeply embarrassing and pretty wonderful because of it. (VCI Entertainment, $14.99 each, not rated)

Panetta, in His Last Lap as Defense Secretary, Navigates a Crisis

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 14

LENGTH: 967 words

LONDON -- Leon E. Panetta's final weeklong trip to the old capitals of Europe initially had the feel of a valedictory lap, one that would nurture the trans-Atlantic alliance and give him the chance to dine in the Italy of his heritage. His staff had to insist it was not a junket.
But by the time Mr. Panetta, the defense secretary, arrived in Rome on Wednesday, news had broken about the hostage-taking in Algeria as Pentagon officials, frustrated and alarmed, scrambled to get basic information out of Algiers. 
Mr. Panetta learned of the seizure of the Algerian gas facility after a meeting on Wednesday afternoon with Prime Minister Mario Monti of Italy. He declared it a ''terrorist act,'' cut short a dinner that night with the Italian defense minister and was up until midnight in his hotel room in briefings.
By Thursday, he was overseeing plans to deploy American military cargo planes to ferry French troops and equipment to Mali, where the government of neighboring Algeria said France's armed intervention was the cause of the abductions.
On Friday, he trundled into a hastily scheduled meeting with Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain as snow fell outside 10 Downing Street. ''Let's start with Algeria,'' Mr. Cameron said.
Earlier, Mr. Panetta inserted language into a set-piece speech on the United States' relationship with Europe, telling students at King's College London that ''terrorists should be on notice that they will find no sanctuary, no refuge, not in Algeria, not in North Africa, not anywhere.''
But the reality is that pursuing those terrorists and any others is now to be the job of the next defense secretary. Chuck Hagel, President Obama's nominee for the post, is encamped down the corridor from Mr. Panetta's Pentagon office, preparing for his Jan. 31 confirmation hearings. If Mr. Hagel, 66, is confirmed, Mr. Panetta is likely to exit in mid-February, leaving a NATO meeting later that month in Brussels to his successor.
''The time has come for me to go home,'' Mr. Panetta told the students in London.
Mr. Panetta's aides say that after nearly a half-century in public service, starting as a first lieutenant in the Army in 1964, Mr. Panetta, 74, is more than ready to retire to his walnut farm in Carmel Valley, Calif. There, he will help his wife, Sylvia, run the Panetta Institute, a public policy organization they founded nearby that works to draw students into public service.
He is also likely to make money: in 2008, the year before he became director of the C.I.A., government disclosure forms show that he made more than $1 million speaking, consulting and serving on corporate boards.
Despite a mostly sunny disposition and a perch near the top of the Obama administration, Mr. Panetta has lived something of a lonely-guy life in Washington.
Aides say that if he does not have an evening event, he returns to an attic walk-up apartment, heats a can of soup or has chicken picked up from Popeye's, and watches sports or old movies. (Mr. Panetta could have lived in a larger house on a compound near the State Department, but aides say he did not want to pay the several thousand dollars a month in rent.)
Since becoming C.I.A. director in 2009 and then starting as defense secretary in July 2011, Mr. Panetta has commuted nearly every weekend to his home in California.
Aides say he would have preferred to retire after his time at the spy agency and to have had the C.I.A.-run raid that killed Osama bin Laden be the final act of a long career. But the White House persuaded him to take over the Pentagon after Robert M. Gates retired as defense secretary in June 2011.
In the past 18 months, Mr. Panetta has largely presided over policies set in place before he arrived: the end of the war in Iraq, the drawdown in Afghanistan and the cutting of the defense budget by nearly $500 billion, possibly more, over the next 10 years. He has quietly attended funerals at Arlington National Cemetery for troops killed in war, and on this trip he intends to write about 10 notes by hand to families of the dead.
But at the C.I.A., he oversaw a vast expansion of a drone program that killed militants in Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia.
Gregarious and profane, Mr. Panetta has become more disciplined in public since his first freewheeling trip as defense secretary to Iraq and Afghanistan in the summer of 2011, when his aides were cleaning up misstatements at nearly every stop. But he returned to his old unleashed ways on Thursday during a talk to soldiers of the 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team at the United States Army Garrison Vicenza in northern Italy.
''Who the hell needs armor-piercing bullets except you guys in battle?'' he said during an off-the-cuff discourse into gun control.
Mr. Panetta had saltier words for members of Congress -- he served in the House from 1977 to 1993 -- who have not reached a budget deal.
''People just got to suck it up, and take on some of the risks, and take on some of the challenges,'' Mr. Panetta told the troops. ''You take the worst risk of all, which is that somebody may shoot you, and you may die. It's a hell of a risk. All we're asking our elected leaders is to take a small part of the risk that maybe'' they will anger some constituents, he said, ''but the fact is, that they'll be doing what is right for the country.''
Mr. Panetta met Saturday with the British defense secretary, Philip Hammond. The crisis will continue, even as he prepares to head home to California.
''As I retire from my own career in public service, I recognize that there's a generational shift under way,'' he told the students in London.
He called the trans-Atlantic alliance of the United States and Europe ''the rock upon which we will build our future security and our prosperity,'' then concluded, ''The baton now passes to a new generation.''

Saying What Matters in 701 Words

BYLINE: By RONALD C. WHITE Jr.. 
The author of ''A. Lincoln: A Biography'' and ''Lincoln's Greatest Speech: The Second Inaugural.''

SECTION: Section SR; Column 0; Sunday Review Desk; OPINION; Pg. 6

LENGTH: 771 words

AS President Obama prepares to deliver his second Inaugural Address, beware: second inaugurals have not fared well in American history. First inaugurals have provided many memorable lines. Franklin D. Roosevelt, taking office in the riptide of the nation's greatest depression, asserted, ''The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.'' John F. Kennedy told Americans, ''Ask not what your country can do for you -- ask what you can do for your country.'' By contrast, the words of second inaugurals have largely slipped from memory.
There's one important exception -- the second inaugural of Abraham Lincoln, delivered on March 4, 1865. 
Why have second inaugurals fared poorly, and why did Lincoln's succeed?
To begin with, second inaugural addresses are almost always too long. Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, Jackson, Grant, Reagan, Clinton and Bush II all gave second addresses longer than their first. Lincoln understood that less is more. He spoke only 701 words.
Second, one word typically dominates second inaugural addresses -- ''I,'' ''I'' and ''I''! Re-elected presidents like to personalize second inaugurals -- believing they have more of a mandate than they did the first time around.
By contrast, Lincoln disappeared in his second inaugural. The speech contains the word ''I'' only once. Lincoln was pointing beyond himself to the future of the American democratic experiment, ''to do all which may achieve and cherish a just, and a lasting peace, among ourselves; and with all nations.''
Third, second inaugural addresses are often too predictable. Audiences come expecting to hear about second-term agendas. Lincoln's audience expected him to answer key questions. Would the Confederate States of America be treated as a conquered nation? How should one distinguish the guilty from the innocent?
But maybe it's a bad idea to give an audience too much satisfaction. Lincoln decided not to address any of these questions. If his listeners expected a triumphalist address heralding a victorious North, they were instead asked to help initiate a new era of reconciliation -- one marked ''with malice toward none, with charity toward all.''
LINCOLN also surprised his audience by steeping his address in religious language. In those 701 words he mentioned God 14 times, referenced the Bible 4 times and emphasized the importance of prayer 3 times. The point is not to count but to listen to the way he invoked religion as a balm for a nation deeply divided.
Lincoln, so knowledgeable of the Constitution, understood that even though the founders separated church and state, America has never separated religion and politics. Lincoln is instructive in how religion can become inclusive. ''Both read the same Bible, and pray to the same God,'' he said, telling an audience angry at the deaths of so many sons that the South read the Bible as much as the North.
Lincoln made a final move that also set himself apart. Inaugural addresses can be exercises in self-congratulation, both of the candidate and the nation. In his second Inaugural Address Lincoln, quoting Matthew 18:7, lovingly scolded America. ''Woe unto the world because of offenses,'' he said. Lincoln dared to declare there was something evil at the core of this great nation: ''If we shall suppose that American Slavery is one of those offenses.''
This year's audience will expect Mr. Obama to detail his priorities for the next four years, from fixing the economy to reforming immigration to curbing gun violence.
Maybe, like Lincoln, he should surprise his audience.
At the service in Newtown, Conn., we heard a president sure-footed in invoking faith as an antidote and using Scripture not as a mere illustration but as the core of his argument. Many have wondered why this side of the president remained veiled during his first four years. This summer, one of the president's spiritual advisers told me that the president did not want to politicize religion. I respect that answer. But his fellow citizens would welcome the spirit of the man we heard in Connecticut, who called for deep healing, not only for the grieving parents, but also for a hurting nation.
Daniel Day-Lewis's riveting portrayal of our 16th president in the movie ''Lincoln'' has meant that our most eloquent president has emerged once again in our national dialogue. No president has come into office with a surer grasp of Lincoln than Barack Obama. He knows Lincoln continually surprised those closest to him. What the nation needs on Jan. 21 is not a lawyerly, rational address on the issues facing our nation but a president ready to share his heart. And daring to tell us how we must change.

The Guns Hiding in Your Portfolio

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

SECTION: Section BU; Column 0; Money and Business/Financial Desk; STRATEGIES; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 1679 words

IF you comb through your 401(k) carefully enough, there is a good chance you'll find something startling: a stock that returned more than 80 percent over the last year.
This powerhouse isn't some Silicon Valley darling but an old industrial company that is prospering by sticking to its original mission, manufacturing in the United States and employing American workers. What's wrong with this picture? Nothing at all -- unless it troubles you that the company makes guns.
It troubles Adam M. Kanzer, the managing director and general counsel of Domini Social Investments, which does not include weapons makers in its own mutual funds. ''We don't need to finance violence in order to invest in our own retirement accounts,'' Mr. Kanzer says.
In this instance, we're talking about Smith & Wesson, the gun manufacturer based in Springfield, Mass. It started making revolvers before the Civil War and still makes them, along with a variety of other firearms -- including guns that use high-capacity magazines, and the semiautomatic weapons known in the gun trade as modern sporting rifles and, in common parlance, as assault rifles. 
Sales of such firearms would be severely restricted under the gun control proposal made on Wednesday by President Obama, who says that much tighter rules are required to curb violence in the United States.
''I will put everything I've got into this,'' Mr. Obama said. And in Albany last week, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York signed into law a sweeping package of gun control measures, including a ban on assault weapons.
Yet Smith & Wesson's products are beloved by many gun enthusiasts, and its shares have been soaring. They rose 5.7 percent on Wednesday, the day of the president's announcement, and 8.3 percent for all of last week. Asked for comment, Elizabeth Sharp, vice president for investor relations at the company, said Smith & Wesson representatives were unavailable.
The company's stellar stock return reflects a nationwide boom in sales of guns and ammunition, set off in part by ''concern among gun buyers that new regulations will make guns harder to buy down the road,'' says Rommel Dionisio, who analyzes the stock for Wedbush Securities. Motivated by a desire to stockpile arms and ammunition while they are still available, people appear to be speeding up purchases that they might have made later.
Even before the Dec. 14 shooting deaths of 20 children and six staff members at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., a so-called Obama surge in gun sales had begun, stimulated at least in part by worries that the president would focus on gun control in his second term, which begins on Monday.
Reliable sales figures are hard to come by. The National Shooting Sports Foundation, which describes itself as the trade association of ''America's firearms, ammunition, hunting and shooting sports industry,'' says that December was the biggest month in the history of American gun sales. And Black Friday, which occurs the day after Thanksgiving and is usually a big sales day for retailers of all kinds, yielded a bonanza for gun dealers, according to the foundation, which called it the biggest single sales day in history to that date.
Mike Bazinet, the foundation's public affairs director, says it based its trend estimates on the federal government's National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which ''tells you the number of times a federally licensed firearm retailer will access the system to do a background check on individuals seeking to purchase firearms.'' He added: ''We've found that there's a very close correlation.'' Sales have spiked since the Newtown shootings, he says, and it's quite possible that there have been even bigger sales days that are not yet reflected in these statistics.
Smith & Wesson is among the businesses that have been profiting from the sales surge. That's not surprising. Its guns have a long history, and they have been immensely popular -- among those who like guns.
The company provided weaponry to the sheriffs and cavalrymen of the Old West. In the movie ''Dirty Harry,'' Clint Eastwood brandished a Smith & Wesson .44 Magnum handgun when he urged punks to make his day. The Smith & Wesson .38-caliber revolver, the Model 10, was one of the most widely used handguns of the entire 20th century. The company's fortunes ebbed a decade ago, but after a decline in sales, it turned around its business with a new range of extremely lethal, modern weapons, including the handguns and semiautomatic rifles that have been spurring sales.
Of course, many individual investors don't share gun buyers' enthusiasm for this company. Nonetheless, many of them own Smith & Wesson shares indirectly. That's because, as a publicly traded company included in numerous market indexes, Smith & Wesson is widely held in multistock portfolios like mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, as well as in financial instruments based on them. Vanguard, the mutual fund giant, is the biggest single investor in Smith & Wesson, and BlackRock, the E.T.F. behemoth, is the second biggest, according to Bloomberg. Thirteen Vanguard mutual funds hold shares of Smith & Wesson directly, and others do so indirectly, according to Vanguard.
If you go through the exercise of unraveling the holdings in your own retirement account, college fund or -- if you're lucky -- trust fund, there is a reasonable chance you will find that Smith & Wesson is, at least indirectly, among your own investments.
Much the same is true for a second business, Sturm, Ruger & Company, another publicly traded gun manufacturer based in New England -- in this case, in the picturesque town of Southport, Conn., a roughly 25-mile drive from Newtown. As a stock, Sturm Ruger has also had excellent performance and it, too, is widely held in mutual funds, E.T.F.'s and retirement accounts. Over the last year, Sturm Ruger's shares have returned 48.5 percent.
Like Smith & Wesson, Sturm Ruger has had its ups and downs. Both stocks fell sharply just after the Newtown shootings, for instance, though they have rebounded. Over the long haul, however, both have outperformed the overall market by a vast margin.
Smith & Wesson had an annualized return of 16 percent over the decade through December, while Sturm Ruger's was a sizzling 21 percent. That compares with 9.7 percent for the Russell 2000 small-cap index to which they both belong. In the same period, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which tracks larger companies, returned an annualized 7.1 percent, dividends included, according to Bloomberg.
Profit, of course, is not the sole concern of all investors, especially after the killings in Newtown. The Bushmaster semiautomatic rifle that authorities say Adam Lanza used in the shooting was not made by either of these companies, although they make similar models. It was made by the Freedom Group, a company owned by the private equity fund Cerberus, which announced after the massacre that it intended to sell its weapons businesses. Pension funds and university endowments, meanwhile, have begun to deliberate whether to divest their firearms holdings -- both those owned through private equity funds and as public shares. Another publicly traded company, Olin, a chemical manufacturer that also makes ammunition, often appears on some of these lists.
The California State Teachers' Retirement System, known as Calstrs, one of the country's largest pension funds, voted to sell off its holdings of weapons companies earlier this month. Princeton's faculty has asked the university endowment to make such a move. Public pension funds in New York, Massachusetts and Chicago have taken steps to shed at least some of their holdings.
What about individual investors who find weapons companies distasteful?
Plenty of alternatives exist -- though they may not be available to all investors or in every investment plan.
Vanguard's standard index funds, intended to mirror broad swaths of financial markets, include weapons companies, but Vanguard also has more than 100 funds that don't contain them, the company says. Similarly, BlackRock, many of whose iShares E.T.F.'s include weapons companies, also offers E.T.F.'s that exclude them.
At the moment, BlackRock manages ''about $226 billion of portfolios that I would broadly group as 'socially responsible,' based on client-defined criteria,'' says J. Richard Kushel, senior managing director of the company. ''On behalf of clients, we are excluding things that clients think don't match their ethical beliefs and guidelines.''
Many other asset managers also exclude weapons companies. Mutual funds run by Domini Social Investments, for example, don't include companies with interests in tobacco, alcohol, gambling, nuclear power or pesticides, as well as makers of weapons and other military equipment, Mr. Kanzer says. And US SIF, which calls itself the trade group for people and institutions ''engaged in sustainable and responsible investing,'' lists on its Web site the ethical criteria of many mutual funds.
BUT many employer-sponsored retirement plans don't offer screening on these grounds. Mr. Kanzer, who has blogged about the subject, says individual investors should pressure their own employers and asset managers to let them ''make responsible decisions and avoid being forced to finance things that are abhorrent.'' Short of outright divestiture, he says, companies can be pushed to modify their policies -- so that a weapons maker, for example, might cease production of certain types of weapons.
For investors who don't find gun companies abhorrent at all, however, market timing may be the crucial issue. Mr. Dionisio, for example, downgraded his appraisal of Smith & Wesson in November to ''neutral'' from ''outperform,'' saying its shares were richly priced. Even if new gun control regulations don't crimp sales, he says, America's gun buying spree isn't sustainable.
Gun making won't be going away, he adds. But the appetites of even fervent gun lovers may soon be slaked. ''Can gun buying continue indefinitely at this pace?'' he asks. ''I don't think so.''

The Diversionary Tactics Of the Gun Lobby

BYLINE: By DOROTHY SAMUELS

SECTION: Section SR; Column 0; Editorial Desk; EDITORIAL | SUNDAY OBSERVER; Pg. 10

LENGTH: 793 words

By the time President Obama formally unveiled his suite of executive actions and new legislation to aggressively fight gun violence, the N.R.A. and its allies were already on the attack with a familiar gun lobby refrain: The nation doesn't need any new gun laws, just better enforcement of laws that already exist.
It's a fraudulent argument, but it has been used effectively again and again over the past 20 years to help block meaningful gun reforms. This time, in the rare opening for change that has followed the massacre in Newtown, Conn., no one should fall for it. The argument that the existing laws would be sufficient if only the officials in charge did their job and enforced them properly is nothing more than a clever diversion. Beyond ignoring deadly loopholes -- many inserted at the N.R.A.'s insistence -- this poses a false choice between strong laws and strong enforcement. Why should one preclude the other? America needs both. 
Some of the steps Mr. Obama has endorsed -- making background checks universal and cracking down on illegal gun trafficking -- are needed to make existing laws more effective. Other things, like reducing the supply of assault weapons and large ammunition clips that so often figure in mass shootings, will require new laws. Obviously, better enforcement does not help when there is no underlying statute.
It is true that the Justice Department should prosecute more people who lie or deliberately provide inaccurate information about their criminal histories on background checks. Studies show that those who lie are more likely than the average person to commit violent crimes after they are denied a firearm purchase. Mr. Obama is trying to correct this with a presidential memorandum encouraging ''supplemental efforts'' by United States attorneys around the country to prosecute felons who lie to evade the background check.
This sort of common-sense strategy has long been recommended by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, the group co-founded by Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York. Yet in 2010, the latest date for which figures are available, just 44 of the nearly 80,000 Americans who flunked backgrounds checks because they lied or gave incorrect information were charged with a crime. That's an indefensibly low number even given competing prosecutorial priorities (though consistent with the record of the Bush administration). But insufficient prosecutorial attention is hardly a reason to oppose new federal gun laws that would make Americans safer.
Nevertheless, the N.R.A.'s cynical effort to shift the debate to lax enforcement continues without letup. An N.R.A. official, Andrew Arulanandam, intoned recently that the government's failure to aggressively investigate people who failed their background checks meant that people who should not be buying guns in the first place were escaping justice -- in his words, ''getting away scot-free.'' He failed to mention that it is only because of the 1993 Brady Act, which the N.R.A. vehemently opposed, that the nation even has a system that can identify prohibited buyers and those who lie.
The hypocrisy of the N.R.A.'s argument that the problem is weak enforcement is exposed by its efforts over the years to undercut what enforcement there is. It has tried mightily to ensure that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives lacks the leadership, resources and legal authority to do its job properly. Restrictions enacted at the gun lobby's behest make it exceedingly hard to identify dealers who falsify sales records, for example, and bar the bureau from putting gun-sale records into a central database for speedy tracing of weapons used in crimes.
Further details of the N.R.A.'s anti-enforcement efforts were revealed by Dennis Henigan, a former vice president of the Brady Campaign, a leading gun-control group, in his 2009 book ''Lethal Logic.'' It recounts how the N.R.A. campaigned in the 1980s to weaken the 1968 Gun Control Act that President Lyndon Johnson pushed through after the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy. The result was the Firearm Owners' Protection Act of 1986, a misnamed law that has made it difficult to investigate and prosecute gun trafficking to this day. For example, it protects unscrupulous gun dealers by prohibiting A.T.F. agents from making more than one unannounced inspection a year. It also makes it hard to revoke their licenses. Those and other damaging provisions from the 1986 law should be tossed out as part of the new, still only hazily defined anti-trafficking measure Mr. Obama has pledged to fight for. The N.R.A.'s opposition won't make that easy.
Keeping guns out of the wrong hands has never been a gun lobby priority. Its priority has been weak enforcement of weak laws.

A Warhol Film Surfaces, But Is It His?

BYLINE: By J. HOBERMAN

SECTION: Section AR; Column 0; Arts and Leisure Desk; Pg. 16

LENGTH: 1345 words

ANDY WARHOL created movies by design, by chance, by mistake, and sometimes by doing nothing at all.
''The nearest thing to a philosophical genius the history of art has produced,'' as the art critic Arthur C. Danto called him, Warhol put quotation marks around the concept of motion pictures. One needn't see ''Empire,'' a fixed-camera recording of eight hours in the life of the Empire State Building, to understand that he had created a temporal monument; by simply titling a similarly silent and static movie after a form of oral sex, Warhol transformed a half-hour close-up of a young man's face in an apparent state of rapture to conflate the root meaning of ''obscene'' with ''off screen.'' 
In the mid-1960s Warhol upended conventional notions of motion pictures, making movies without regard to scripts or acting or editing or moving the camera. According to his erstwhile manager and assistant, Paul Morrissey, 74, interviewed by phone from his Manhattan apartment, Warhol ''never directed anything.'' Except, it would seem, from beyond the grave. Starting Wednesday the Museum of Modern Art is giving a six-day run to Warhol's first posthumous feature, ''San Diego Surf,'' a movie that, considering its convoluted provenance and Warhol's hands-off methodology, might be more creditably attributed to Mr. Morrissey.
Filmed in May 1968, shortly before Warhol was shot and nearly killed by a deranged member of his entourage, and edited by Mr. Morrissey in the mid-1990s almost a decade after Warhol's death, ''San Diego Surf'' did not receive a public screening until it was shown in late 2011 at Art Basel Miami Beach, under the auspices of the Andy Warhol Museum, which distributes Warhol's movies. (It was also previewed last November at the Modern in conjunction with the series To Save and Project, on which I served as a guest curator.)
Warhol's earliest movies were silent, largely Minimalist exercises in extreme duration. In 1965 he purchased an unwieldy sound-on-film Auricon camera and began deploying the personalities he called ''superstars'' in fitfully dramatic situations, mainly devised by the playwright Ron Tavel. The frame was static, the shots were uninterrupted. Whatever happened in front of the camera over the course of a single setup and a 35-minute reel was the movie, and the results could be unlike any movies ever made. Because of a malfunction in the camera lens, the entire first reel of the Edie Sedgwick vehicle ''Poor Little Rich Girl'' is implacably out-of-focus.
After the commercial breakthrough of the largely improvised, two-screen ''Chelsea Girls'' in 1966 Warhol shifted from Tavel's desultory melodramas to cursorily edited ensemble films constructed around his garrulous crew of superstars. These more commercial features, including ''I, a Man'' and ''Lonesome Cowboys,'' were made in (uncredited) collaboration with Mr. Morrissey. After Warhol was shot and seemingly retired from filmmaking Mr. Morrissey continued making increasingly conventional movies under Warhol's name -- or rather, continued the Warhol brand into the 1970s with ''Trash,'' ''Heat'' and several 3-D features.
''Lonesome Cowboys'' ended with two of its principals taking off for California to become surfers; very much a sequel, ''San Diego Surf'' features much the same cast and was filmed, four months later, on a private beach in San Diego. As with ''Lonesome'' the movie was shot with two 16-millimeter cameras, one operated by Warhol and the other by Mr. Morrissey. The superstar Viva and the veteran underground movie performer Taylor Mead, paired in ''Lonesome'' as a man-hungry virgin and her epicene dueסa, here play a wealthy married couple with a baby, looking to rent their beach house to some local surfers.
As in ''Lonesome'' the puckish Mr. Mead cuts capers while Viva delivers a number of acerbic soliloquies, calling the surfers repressed homosexuals. Both profess sexual interest in the actual surfers who wander onto the set, intermittently serving as their stooges.
In its lackadaisical way ''San Diego Surf'' anticipates the strategies of Sacha Baron Cohen's ''Borat'' in its use of unwitting civilians as props. One such is an infant, identified at the movie's preview screening by Mr. Mead as belonging to the couple who lent the filmmakers their house. In the course of a domestic spat Viva carelessly drops the baby. The child is caught by the surprisingly alert Joe Dallesandro, as Viva, only slightly abashed, continues her tirade.
The real disaster would occur days after Warhol returned to New York. With the severely wounded artist recuperating in the hospital, Mr. Morrissey added a postscript (filmed in Warhol's Union Square headquarters) in which Mr. Mead wheedlingly importunes an embarrassed-looking ''surfer'' (Tom Hompertz) to urinate on him as he absurdly crouches on a surfboard.
''San Diego Surf'' was at least partially edited, but although publicized, it was never released. One 1969 letter of inquiry received the response that the film was not yet completed and would be available later in the year. By that time Mr. Morrissey had opened his highly successful solo feature ''Flesh,'' and was preparing to shoot his second, ''Trash.'' ''I didn't think it was strong enough to hold an audience,'' he recalled when asked why ''San Diego Surf'' was never released.
A quarter century passed. In 1995, according to information provided by the Warhol Museum, the Warhol Foundation commissioned Mr. Morrissey, under the supervision of Dara Meyers-Kingsley, its film and video collection's director at the time, to complete the editing in accordance with existing notes. Ms. Meyers-Kingsley, who left the foundation in 1996, said she no longer remembers the specifics of the project. Mr. Morrissey disputes them: ''Where do they get that 'partially edited'?'' he said. ''Where do they get that idea of 'existing notes'? I never made any notes -- and poor Andy couldn't.''
Mr. Morrissey recalls only checking the splices on the already edited work print and sending the camera original to the lab to be cut and printed. In any case it was there that the edited ''San Diego Surf'' continued to reside, along with as many as 25 reels of original material, much of it shot by Warhol, for another 16 years. Asked why it had taken so long to release Mr. Morrissey's cut, Geralyn Huxley, the Warhol Museum's curator of film and video, interviewed in a conference call with an assistant curator, Greg Pierce, said only that ''we chose not to,'' adding, ''Our energy was working on other parts of the collection.''
Despite Mr. Morrissey's edit, the museum credits the movie solely to Warhol, and it will appear as Warhol's in the catalogue raisonnי currently being developed because, Mr. Pierce explained, ''Anytime Warhol's controlling the camera it's a Warhol film.''
But is it Warhol's footage or Mr. Morrissey's in the Morrisssey-edited version? Does it matter? In the mid-1990s the Andy Warhol Foundation set up an ''authentication board'' to determine whether certain silk-screens and other works were in fact bona fide Warhols -- and, by implication, to devalue those that were not considered genuine. Attributing the Warhol Foundation's restoration of ''San Diego Surf'' to Warhol reverses the process.
Around the time that Mr. Morrissey completed ''San Diego Surf'' he came to an agreement with the Warhol Foundation, securing the rights to ''Flesh,'' ''Trash,'' and other Warhol productions and waiving them for movies like ''Lonesome Cowboys'' and others, including ''San Diego Surf,'' on which he might have a legitimate claim. Thus the 1971 feature ''Women in Revolt,'' a more interesting movie than ''San Diego Surf'' (and, according to my research, one in which Warhol was far more involved), is credited to, and owned, by Mr. Morrissey, while ''San Diego Surf'' is attributed to Warhol and owned by the Warhol Museum.
''I cast it, I wrote it, I produced it,'' Mr. Morrissey said, while cheerfully declining to take credit. ''I did everything. Why don't they attribute it to Lady Gaga? She's much more famous than Andy.''

Earl Weaver, a Volatile, Visionary Manager, Dies at 82

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER; Colin Moynihan contributed reporting.

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Obituary; Pg. 26

LENGTH: 1868 words

Earl Weaver, the Hall of Fame manager who brought pugnacity and pragmatism to the Baltimore Orioles dugout, leading the team to five 100-win seasons, four American League pennants and the 1970 World Series championship, and tormenting a generation of umpires along the way, died early Saturday. He was 82.
Dick Gordon, Weaver's marketing agent, told The Associated Press that Weaver had died on a Caribbean cruise sponsored by the team, and that the cause of death had not been determined.
A bantam in both stature -- he was 5 feet 7 inches, maybe -- and temperament, Weaver was among the most influential managers in modern baseball history, and among the most combative. His imperiousness as a leader made battles with his players as frequent as those with umpires. 
Aware that the outcome of any season might rest on the outcome of any game, and the outcome of any game on a play, a pitch or an umpire's call, he marshaled a scholar's familiarity with the rule book, a statistician's data, a psychologist's motivational skills and a heckler's needle into a relentless advocacy for the Orioles.
''On my tombstone just write, 'The Sorest Loser Who Ever Lived,' '' he said in 1986, his final season.
He managed the Orioles as a pragmatist rather than as a hunch player, drawing on his observations during a two-decade career in the minor leagues, first as a good-field-no-hit infielder and later as a manager. Weaver relished hitters who could get on base and hit the long ball, starting pitchers who could go deep in a game and fielders who could steal runs.
''Pitching, defense and the three-run homer'' was Weaver's stated formula for winning ballgames.
Weaver's Orioles featured a number of great players -- including the Hall of Famers Brooks Robinson, Frank Robinson, Eddie Murray and Jim Palmer -- but knowing that depth helped win pennants, he was a shrewd roster builder. He chose players to fill in the gaps around his stars, not necessarily for their overall ability or athleticism but for their isolated skills -- a good outfield arm, base running speed, power -- and then deployed them in situations where they were most likely to succeed.
In 1979, for example, his left-field platoon of John Lowenstein and Gary Roenicke, two middling players, combined for 36 home runs and 98 runs batted in, All-Star figures for any outfielder.
''The man's a genius at finding situations where an average player -- like me -- can look like a star because of subtle factors working in your favor,'' Lowenstein said in 1982. ''He has a passion for finding the perfect player for the perfect spot.''
Weaver's game strategy was built around treasuring each of his team's allotted 27 outs and protecting them by eschewing conventional tactics like the sacrifice bunt and the hit-and-run. And he is often credited for his pioneering use of statistics in the dugout.
Long before computer analyses and sabermetrics (the study of baseball statistics) became integral to managerial strategy, long before the so-called Moneyball era and its championing of on-base percentage and slugging percentage as crucial measures of a player's value, Weaver recognized that baseball's traditional measures of success -- batting average, earned run average and the like -- were insufficient for his purposes.
He knew, for example, that certain hitters fared better against certain pitchers and that sometimes, weak hitters were better against some pitchers than stronger hitters were. So he kept tabs on, among other things, how each of his hitters had performed in the past against individual pitchers on opposing teams.
The weak-hitting shortstop Mark Belanger was often sent in to play when Jim Kern, a fireballing relief pitcher for Cleveland, Texas and others, was on the mound: inexplicably, Belanger hit .625 against him in his career.
In 1975, during spring training, Weaver introduced the use of a radar gun to measure the speed of pitches.
''Weaver was the Copernicus of baseball,'' Tom Verducci wrote in Sports Illustrated in 2009. ''Just as Copernicus understood heliocentric cosmology a full century before the invention of the telescope, Weaver understood smart baseball a generation before it was empirically demonstrated.''
Weaver managed the Orioles from 1968 through 1982, then came out of retirement in mid-1985 and managed the team through the end of 1986. His overall record was 1,480 victories and 1,060 losses, a .583 winning percentage, ninth in major league history and first among managers whose careers began in the past half-century. His only losing season was his last.
With a sandpaper voice, a taste for beer (he was twice charged with drunken driving) and a tense, competitive manner, Weaver was a crusty personality, though he had a sharp wit and a well-developed sense of mischief. Once, when outfielder Pat Kelly was irritated that Weaver was not giving him enough time for a pregame prayer meeting, he said, ''Earl, don't you want us to walk with the Lord?'' Weaver replied that he would rather have Kelly walk with the bases loaded.
A chain smoker who puffed on Raleighs between innings in the passageway from the clubhouse to the dugout, Weaver considered it improper to be friendly with his players lest his feelings impede his ability to make decisions about them.
He contended that he rarely spoke to stars like Frank Robinson, and his long-running relationships with other players -- notably Palmer and catcher Rick Dempsey -- were testy, though many admired his competitive zeal and his winning record.
''Earl is right -- you can't be friends with players,'' Dempsey said in an interview with The New York Times in 1982. ''And Earl manages to be unfriendly with players. We alienate each other when it comes time to go on the field. He wants pitchers to call their own games. But if the pitcher gets hit, I get blamed.''
But most fans will remember Weaver for his tirades against umpires. He was ejected from nearly 100 games, often after colorful displays of temper with the beak of his cap turned around so he would not accidentally rap the ump in the forehead with it.
Once, after Weaver had been ejected and the umpire Jim Evans pulled out a stopwatch to give him 60 seconds to leave the field before the Orioles would forfeit the game, Weaver snatched the stopwatch out of Evans's hand and flung it into the dugout. Once he tore up a rule book in front of an umpire's face and tossed the confetti into the wind.
In 1980, in the first inning of a game between the Orioles and the Detroit Tigers, Weaver objected to a balk call by Bill Haller, and the two men engaged in a marathon, profanity-laced shouting match that was caught on videotape and has since become a YouTube favorite.
''I'd get so mad, I couldn't see straight,'' Weaver said to Playboy in 1982. ''I mean, just a wrong ball or strike call can cost you a game. Well, that can cost me my job! Now I can't send my kids through college!''
He added: ''If an umpire misses a called third strike and the other side ends up scoring because of it, I'm not going to forget it. If there are runners on second and third and two out, and if the umpire has just given the hitter an extra strike and the next pitch goes into the hole and both runs score, I've got to say something to the guy. With that one call, he's keeping my kid from going to school!''
Earl Sidney Weaver was born on Aug. 14, 1930, in St. Louis, where his father was a dry cleaner whose customers included the Cardinals and the Browns. He immersed himself in baseball from boyhood, playing second base in high school, and in spite of being a weak hitter and a slow runner, he drew contract offers from both local major league teams for his good glove and heady play.
He signed with the Cardinals in 1948, embarking on a minor league career that lasted two decades. By 1956, he was managing as well as playing, and in 1957, he joined the Orioles organization, which was intrigued by his managerial skill. From then on, as he recognized he would not make it to the big leagues as a player, he managed more and played less.
''It broke my heart,'' he told Time magazine in 1979, ''but right then, I started becoming a good baseball person, because when I came to recognize and, more important, accept my own deficiencies, then I could recognize other players' inabilities and learn to accept them, not for what they can't do, but for what they can do. And in the process, I suppose, I broke some hearts.''
In the minors, Weaver developed his strategic skill as well as his penchant for umpire baiting. On one occasion, after a close fair-foul call against him on a shot down the third-base line, he tore the bag out of the ground and stormed off with it, explaining to the umpire, ''You're not using this anyway.''
The Orioles promoted him to the big leagues as a first-base coach in April 1968, and in July, with the team in third place, he replaced Hank Bauer as the manager; the Orioles finished second, then won the American League pennant the next year, winning 109 games in the regular season.
To the astonishment of most, however, they lost the World Series to a team widely considered inferior: the so-called Miracle Mets. In Game 4, won by the Mets, Weaver was ejected, the first manager to be thrown out of a World Series game in 34 years.
In 1970, the Orioles won 108 games and did win the Series, defeating the Cincinnati Reds.
And in 1971, they were the American League champions again, one of only two teams in major league history (the 1920 Chicago White Sox were the other) with four 20-game winning pitchers -- Palmer, Mike Cuellar, Dave McNally and Pat Dobson -- but lost the Series to the Pittsburgh Pirates.
The Orioles lost to the Pirates again in 1979, dropping the Series in seven games after leading by three games to one. In a Sporting News poll of other managers, Weaver won the Manager of the Year award anyway.
When he retired the first time in 1982, he was only 52.
''I really don't like confrontations,'' Weaver said that year. ''One of the reasons I'm retiring is that I'm tired of hurting people's feelings.''
Weaver, whose first marriage ended in divorce, lived in Pembroke Pines, Fla., with his second wife, the former Marianna Osgood, whom he married in 1964. According to his stepdaughter, Kimberly Ann Benson of Bel Air, Md., his other survivors include a son, Michael Weaver of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; two daughters, Rhonda Harms of Houston and Theresa Leahy of St. Louis; seven grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.
Weaver collected his wit and wisdom in two books, ''It's What You Learn After You Know It All That Counts,'' a memoir written with Berry Stainback, and ''Weaver on Strategy,'' with Terry Pluto. He was voted into the Hall of Fame in 1996, and in his induction speech, he gave surprising thanks to a group he often seemed to revile: the umpires.
''I'm serious when I say their integrity and honesty is, and must be, beyond reproach,'' he said, in part. ''They accept the players' and managers' ire and they never let it affect their next call. Now, counting balls and strikes, and close plays on the bases, they must have made over a million calls while I was managing, and except for those 91 or 92 times I disagreed, they got the other ones right.''

The author of ''The World Until Yesterday'' says that if he had to recommend one book of geography to children, he would suggest his own ''Guns, Germs, and Steel.''
What book is on your night stand now?
Sabine Kuegler, ''Child of the Jungle.'' This unique book is the autobiography of the daughter of a German missionary linguist couple, who moved when she was a child to live with a Fayu clan in a remote area of swamp forest in Indonesian New Guinea. The Fayu experienced first contact with outsiders under terrifying conditions, while I was working in the area in 1979. In the Fayu village while Sabine was growing up there, the only non-Fayu were Sabine, her parents and her two siblings. Sabine grew up speaking Fayu (as well as German, Indonesian and English), with all of her playmates Fayu children, and learning to think and act like a Fayu. At the age of 17 her parents sent her back to Europe to attend boarding school. 
The result for Sabine was an extreme case of culture shock. This book approximates an account of Western society through the eyes of a New Guinean. Europe was as much of a shock to Sabine as the New Guinea jungle is to a Westerner. Through Sabine's words, we experience what it is like to encounter traffic lights, trains and strangers for the first time. By Fayu standards, the variety of chocolates in Europe is wonderful, but the way that Europeans treat each other is not wonderful. This book gives a view of Western life from a fresh perspective shared by no Westerner.
What was the last truly great book you read?
Primo Levi, ''If This Is a Man'' (original, ''Se Questo ֳ[#x2c6] un Uomo,'' 1947). At one level, Levi's book is about how as a young Italian Jewish chemist joining the resistance during World War II, he was captured, sent to Auschwitz, and survived. At another level, the book is about our everyday life issues, magnified: the life-and-death consequences of chance, the problem of evil, the impossibility of separating one's moral code from surrounding circumstances, and the difficulties of maintaining one's sanity and humanness in the presence of injustice and bad people. Levi dealt with these issues and was lucky, with the result that he survived Auschwitz and went on to become one of the greatest authors (both of nonfiction and fiction) of postwar Italy. But he survived at a price. One of the prices, the loss of his religious beliefs, he summarized as follows: ''I must say that the experience of Auschwitz for me was such as to sweep away any remnants of the religious education that I had had. .ג[#x20ac][#x2c6].ג[#x20ac][#x2c6]. Auschwitz existed, therefore God cannot exist. I find no solution to that dilemma. I seek a solution, but I don't find it.''
If you had to come up with your own Best of 2012 list, what book would be at the top?
There were so many good books in 2012 that rather than attempt to identify the best of them, I'll mention here one that is among the best and that deserves more attention than it has received. It's Howard Steven Friedman, ''The Measure of a Nation: How to Regain America's Competitive Edge and Boost Our Global Standing.'' Despite the subtitle, this book is not just another one of hundreds of books making recommendations about what the U.S. should be doing. Instead, Friedman compares the United States with 13 other rich countries in five vital measures of individual and national security: health, safety, education, democracy and equality. Friedman explains clearly and convincingly, writes engagingly and laces his text with personal examples. Contrary to what many Americans think, the U.S. does not lead the world by these measures. Friedman's recommendations are specific and feasible. I'm glad that I resisted my instinct of dismissing the book when I first saw its cover: it's thought-provoking, and good reading.
What's your favorite genre? Any guilty pleasures?
The genre in which I do most of my leisure reading (i.e., reading not targeted for researching my own next book) is Italian literature. My original motive was to practice my grasp on the Italian language, which I took up at age 61. But it turns out that Italy has been blessed with some of the world's great writers, from Dante, Boccaccio and Machiavelli in the past to several modern authors whom I mention here in answers to other questions.
If you could require the president to read one book, what would it be?
It would be Niccolֳ² Machiavelli, ''The Prince.'' Machiavelli is frequently dismissed today as an amoral cynic who supposedly considered the end to justify the means. In fact, Machiavelli is a crystal-clear realist who understands the limits and uses of power. Fundamental to his thinking is the distinction he draws between the concepts expressed in Italian as virtֳ¹ and fortuna. These don't mean ''virtue'' and ''fortune.'' Instead, virtֳ¹ refers to the sphere in which a statesman can influence his world by his own actions, contrasted with fortuna, meaning the role of chance beyond a statesman's control. But Machiavelli makes clear, in a wonderful metaphor contrasting an uncontrollable flood with protective measures that can be taken in anticipation of a flood, that we are not helpless at the hands of bad luck. Among a statesman's tasks is to anticipate what might go wrong, and to plan for it. Every president (and all of us nonpoliticians as well) should read Machiavelli and incorporate his thinking.
What were your favorite books as a child? Did you have a favorite character or hero?
Two books stand out. One is ''The Complete Sherlock Holmes'': all 1,122 pages, containing four novels and 56 short stories. I read them first as a child and have reread them about every 10 years since then, including reading them to my own sons when they were children. The other book is Thoreau's ''Walden,'' which I read once when I was young, and which was the single book that has most influenced me. Thoreau's message that I took away was: Be honest with yourself, think clearly, decide what is most important and do it regardless of what other people think. Reading Thoreau felt like standing in dazzlingly bright light.
What's the best book for a parent to buy for a child interested in learning more about geography and the relationship between geography and society?
I believe that I'm being realistic, not egotistical or self-promoting, when I answer: my own book ''Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies.'' The book explains the long-term effects of geography -- especially continental differences in wild plant and animal species available for domestication, and in shapes, areas and isolations -- in molding the different histories of the peoples native to the different continents. While I wrote the book for adults, to my surprise it has been frequently adopted in schools. I discovered this when one day my twin sons, then in seventh grade, came home from school angry at me. They explained, ''Daddy, our class has been assigned a chapter of your book to read, and the teacher will invite you in to discuss your book, and we haven't read your book yet, but we are sure that it is a bad book.'' When I did receive the teacher's invitation and arrived at the class, my sons were seated in the back row, with their gazes averted in embarrassment and disgust. But my sons warmed up when they saw that their classmates hadn't hated but had enjoyed my book. By the end of the class, my sons were smiling. Since then, they have been among my most devoted defenders, and they erupt in indignation if they hear any of my books criticized. Since that visit to my sons' school, I've had many school visits and invitations, and letters daily from schoolchildren of all ages who have been stimulated by my books.
What was the last book that made you cry? The last book that made you laugh?
The answers to both of those questions are: the same book or series of books. It's the series of Don Camillo stories, by the modern Italian author Giovanni Guareschi, collected in three volumes. The stories are set in a small Italian town, and involve three protagonists: the local priest Don Camillo; the mayor Peppone; and the church's Christ statue, which Don Camillo consults regularly for advice and which answers. Don Camillo and Peppone clash constantly in words and occasionally with their fists. But the two of them are joined by a common sense of humanity. The Don Camillo stories range from gut-wrenchingly tragic to hilarious. Whenever I start the next story in Guareschi's collection, I never know in advance whether it will make me cry or laugh.
What's the best love story you've ever read?
Tolstoy's ''Anna Karenina'' -- even though the love goes sour and the book has a sad ending.
Name a book you just couldn't finish.
Modern Italy's leading woman author is Dacia Maraini. She has written many wonderful, realistic, emotionally rich novels and short stories, all of which I have enjoyed -- with one exception. Her book ''Woman at War'' (''Donna in Guerra'') describes unpleasant protagonists experiencing unpleasant events and relationships. Precisely because Dacia Maraini's writing is so convincing, by Page 97 I couldn't stand to submerge myself any longer in that unpleasantness, and I stopped reading.
If you could meet any writer, dead or alive, who would it be? What would you want to know?
My choice would be the classical Greek historian Thucydides, who devoted the latter part of his life to a book detailing the history of the long series of wars between Athens and Sparta in the fifth century B.C. His book is considered to have laid the foundations of the discipline of history. I read Thucydides every decade or so, about as often as I read ''Sherlock Holmes.'' The reasons why Thucydides is still widely read today, over 2,400 years after he lived, are that his insights into politics and war are universal and still relevant; his moral and psychological reflections on war and history are profound; and his accounts of debates and battles are thrilling. If I met him, I would be curious to discover whether he was really as devoid of humor as is his book. In his entire book there is not a single sentence that could be considered remotely humorous, no less a joke. Second, I would want to ask him how he managed to write such a calm and dispassionate account of a passionate and vicious war, when he himself served as an Athenian general but was fired and exiled after a defeat, and when he loved and admired one of the two sides (the Athenians). Finally, I would ask him the same question that all subsequent historians have wondered: How close to the original does he think are his verbatim accounts of lengthy speeches at whose delivery he was not ֲpresent?
What are you planning to read next?
I am going to reread ֲThucydides.

Which Way Did the Taliban Go?

BYLINE: By LUKE MOGELSON

SECTION: Section MM; Column 0; Magazine Desk; Pg. 28

LENGTH: 7479 words

The village was abandoned. Streets deserted. Houses empty. Behind the central mosque rose a steep escarpment. Behind the escarpment mountains upon mountains. Up there -- above the timberline, among the peaks -- a white Taliban flag whipped in the wind. Several Afghan soldiers were admiring it when a stunted and contorted person emerged from an alley. Dressed in rags, he waved a hennaed fist at them and wailed. Tears streamed down his face. Most of the soldiers ignored him. Some laughed uncomfortably. A few jabbed their rifles at his chest and simulated shooting. The man carried on undeterred -- reproaching them in strange tongues. 
A truck pulled up, and Lt. Col. Mohammad Daowood, the battalion commander, stepped out. Everyone waited to see what he would do. Daowood is a man alive to his environment and adept at adjusting his behavior by severe or subtle degrees. He can transform, instantaneously, from empathetic ally to vicious disciplinarian. To be with him is to be in constant suspense over the direction of his mood. At the same time, there is a calculation to his temper. You feel it is always deliberately, never capriciously, employed. This only adds to his authority and makes it impossible to imagine him in a situation of which he is not the master. A flicker of recognition in the deranged man's eyes suggested that he intuited this. He approached Daowood almost bashfully; only as he closed within striking range did he seem to regain his lunatic energy, emitting a low, threatening moan. We waited for Daowood to hit him. Instead, Daowood began to clap and sing. Instantly, the man's face reorganized itself. Tearful indignation became pure, childish joy. He started to dance.
This continued for a surprisingly long time. The commander clapping and singing. The deranged man lost in a kind of ecstatic, whirling performance, waving his prayer cap in the air, stamping his feet. When at last Daowood stopped, the man was his. He stood there -- breathless and obsequious -- waiting for what came next. Daowood mimed the motion of wrapping a turban on his head. Where are the Taliban? Eager to please, the man beamed and pointed across the valley.
Several hours later, as I shared the bed of a pickup truck with an Afghan soldier who manned a machine gun mounted on the roof of the cab, it became evident that we were lost. The rest of the company was nowhere to be seen, though we could hear them, not far off, exchanging rocket and automatic-weapons fire with insurgents who had fled into the mountains and were hiding behind protective crags, shooting down. The driver sped up one narrow rutted path after another. The paths were hemmed in by rock walls -- a labyrinth of cul-de-sacs -- and the driver grew more panicked and reckless with each dead end. Aside from the occasional night raid, no Afghan or American forces had been to this place in more than a decade. Men stood on top of the walls, watching.
''Where are we going?'' I asked the machine-gunner.
He offered the words I had heard time and again -- so often, and so predictably, they could be the battalion motto. The words were invoked in response to such questions as: What is the plan? Who is shooting? Where will we sleep tonight? How many dead?
The words are ''Mulam nes'' -- ''It isn't clear.''
Finally the driver stopped and asked a bearded man in a black turban for directions. The man -- a Talib? -- kindly pointed the way.
Soon we arrived on a bare ridge and found Colonel Daowood almost alone. Two young soldiers stood nearby with rifles. Daowood sat on a rock. A teenage boy knelt before him, kowtowing, wrists cuffed behind his back. Daowood was doing something to his head. As we got closer, we saw that he held scissors and was roughly shearing the boy's hair. A neat pile of long black locks lay on the ground between Daowood's feet.
When Daowood noticed us, he smiled and winked. Then he went back to work, screaming in the boy's ear, ''Now do you like being a Talib?''
''No,'' the boy whimpered.
''What?''
''No, no, no.''
Daowood lifted him to his feet and examined with satisfaction the ugly patchwork of uneven tufts and bald scalp. He removed the boy's handcuffs and said, ''Go.''
The boy ran away, forgetting his shoes.
While Daowood was giving the haircut, our driver, who it turned out was a company commander, yelled at a pair of intrepid young soldiers who had taken it upon themselves to scale the mountain and capture the Taliban's flag. We were leaving soon, and the commander wanted them to come back down. The young soldiers, however, were too high. They couldn't hear him. The commander yelled and yelled. If only they had radios. If only he had a radio. In lieu of one, the commander drew his sidearm, aimed in the general vicinity of the soldiers, then shot two bullets.
The soldiers ducked, peered down. The commander waved.
It was the third day of a four-day operation being conducted by the Afghan National Army (A.N.A.) in Chak District, Wardak Province. There were no U.S. forces in sight. Every so often, a pair of American attack helicopters circled overhead; otherwise, the Afghans -- roughly 400 of them -- were on their own. For the A.N.A. -- which every day assumes a greater share of responsibility for the security of Afghanistan -- the operation was an ambitious undertaking and a test of its ability to function independently. For years now, the U.S. military's priority in Afghanistan has been shifting from effectively prosecuting the present war to preparing Afghans for a future one in which our role is minimal. But even as American troops return home and American bases across the country close, such a future continues to feel difficult to envision. How will the A.N.A. fare when it is truly on its own? Predictions vary, tending toward the pessimistic. To the extent that assessments of the competency and preparedness of the A.N.A. take into consideration on-the-ground observations, however, they are usually limited to the perspective of American forces working in concert with Afghan units.
After a week with Daowood's battalion, what I found is that the A.N.A. looks very different when there are no Americans around.
So does the war.
The operation to Chak District was nearly over before it began. Just hours before departure, during a briefing at Combat Outpost Dash-e Towp, the battalion headquarters, Daowood told his subordinate officers: ''The only thing we're waiting on is the fuel. If we don't receive the fuel, we will not be able to do the operation.'' A cohort of American advisers stood in the back of the room, silently listening. In the past, they probably would have offered to provide the fuel themselves. But that paradigm has changed. Increasingly, A.N.A. units must rely on their own supply lines, however inefficient they may be. Nevertheless, as the officers rose from their chairs, an Afghan captain pulled aside one of the advisers and told him the battalion lacked batteries for the metal detectors used to find improvised explosive devices. The adviser sighed. ''Come over to our side,'' he said, ''and we'll see what we can do.''
The American side of Dash-e Towp is separated from the Afghan side by a tall wall and a door that can be opened only with a code to which the Afghans do not have access. Whereas a close partnership between coalition and Afghan forces was for years considered a cornerstone of the overall military strategy (shohna ba shohna -- shoulder to shoulder -- went the ubiquitous NATO slogan), recently the Americans have distanced and even sequestered themselves from their erstwhile comrades. The about-face is a response to a rash of insider or ''green on blue'' attacks that killed more than 60 foreign troops in 2012 (and wounded 94), accounting for 22 percent of all coalition combat deaths. The Americans claim that many of the killings result from cultural differences; the Taliban claim to have infiltrated the security forces; the Afghan government claims ''foreign spy agencies'' are to blame. Whatever their provenance, the attacks have eroded trust to such a degree that NATO has begun designating some personnel as ''guardian angels.'' It is the guardian angel's job to protect the NATO soldier from the Afghan soldier whom it is the NATO soldier's job to train.
Other concerns abound. When the time comes, for instance, will Afghanistan's army be able to maintain its own equipment and facilities? Evacuate and treat its own casualties? Overcome ethnic divisions within its ranks? Furnish its units with essential rations like food and fuel? Retain sufficient numbers despite alarmingly high attrition rates? Implement a uniform training doctrine despite alarmingly low literacy rates? Today, according to the Pentagon, exactly one Afghan brigade is capable of operating without any help from the coalition. For better or worse, come Dec. 31, 2014, the other 22 will likely have to do the same.
In anticipation of this reality, the A.N.A. has begun a countrywide realignment of troops that is transforming the battlefield. ''Look at the situation,'' Gen. Sher Mohamad Karimi, the chief of army staff, told me recently in Kabul. ''One hundred and forty thousand international troops, with all the power that they have -- the aircraft, the artillery, the tanks, the support -- all of that now is going. You cannot expect the Afghan Army to do exactly what the international troops were doing.'' As coalition forces diminish, that is, the A.N.A. must decide not only how to fill the gaps but also which gaps to forgo filling. For years, to secure roads and rural areas, Afghan soldiers have manned hundreds of check posts throughout the provinces. Now the A.N.A. plans to relinquish almost all of these in favor of consolidating its forces in significantly fewer locations. General Karimi claims there are two reasons for doing this. First: the Afghans simply lack the wherewithal to keep the more remote posts adequately provisioned. Second: the A.N.A. must move away from defending static positions, toward executing offensive operations. Theoretically, the police will take over check posts as the army quits them. But this will not always be the case; it may seldom be the case. And when vacated posts are not assumed by the police -- as has happened in Wardak -- it will be hard not to see the ongoing ''realignment of troops'' as anything other than an old-fashioned retreat.
Chak was one of the first districts in Afghanistan to undergo this change. When Daowood's battalion woke around 3 a.m. and headed out from Dash-e Towp, the convoy included several large flatbed trailers hauling backhoes and bulldozers that would be used to destroy five of the six A.N.A. check posts in the area. (The last time abandoned posts were left standing in Wardak Province, the Taliban moved into them.) The sun was just starting to rise when the battalion arrived at the first one: a compact fortress of gravel-filled Hesco barriers perched on a squat hill that overlooked the entrance to the district. It was easy to see, from here, why the Taliban liked Chak. Parallel ranges form a wide valley with a river snaking down its middle. Apple orchards and trees with white trunks and bright yellow leaves crowd the basin. Dark canyons branch into the mountains. A single road follows the river deeper into the valley, connecting the lawless foothills of the Hindu Kush to Highway 1, a critical transit route that bridges Kabul and Kandahar, northern and southern Afghanistan.
After being reconstructed by an American firm at an estimated cost of $300 million, Highway 1 was extolled by the U.S. ambassador, in 2005, as ''a symbol of Afghan renewal and progress.'' Since then it has become one of the most dangerous roads on earth, scarred by bomb blasts, the site of frequent ambushes and executions by insurgent marauders, strewed with the charred carcasses of fuel tankers set alight on their way to NATO bases. As Daowood looked out from the top of the hill, he explained that Chak was an ideal staging ground for attacks on the highway and that the check posts were the only way to protect it. ''When we had these check posts, there was good security,'' Daowood said. ''The people were happy. Of course, when we leave them, the Taliban will come back. As soon as we're gone, they will own this whole area.''
Already, Daowood said, the road following the river was known to accommodate large quantities of remotely detonated bombs. As the colonel ordered the convoy to start forward, I watched two minesweepers testing out their metal detectors. The devices looked antique: Vietnam-era green with thick black wires connected to bulky plastic headphones. It was the sort of technology that made you remember ham radios, and I confess I was skeptical of their ability to clear the way. But after only a half-mile or so, one of the minesweepers stopped. A skinny, bearded soldier jumped out of a Humvee wielding a pickax. The minesweeper pointed at a spot. The soldier with the pickax attacked it. Soon he called to Daowood: ''Found it!''
When C-4 explosive was packed around the bomb and exploded from what was deemed a safe remove, the blast proved much larger than anyone expected. Dirt rained down on those of us who were crouched behind a tree 100 meters away. The crater rendered the road impassable, obliging the Afghans to spend the next half-hour filling it with stones. By the time we started moving again, the minesweepers had begun working on another bomb just around the bend. I found the skinny, bearded soldier standing to the side with his pickax lightly balanced on his shoulder, smoking an immense joint.
His name was Shafiullah. He wore a pair of blue latex medical gloves and a metal helmet several sizes too big that sat low and loose over wide, wild eyes: preternaturally alert eyes bugging from their sockets as if to get a little closer to whatever they were looking at. ''Did you see that last one?'' Shafiullah wanted to know.
''It was big.''
He nodded rapidly, the helmet bucking forward and backward on his head, now threatening to fly off, now jerked into place by its leather chinstrap.
''Very big! Very nice!'' He took another toke, held the doobie upright and became suddenly, deeply engrossed in its glowing tip.
''What are the gloves for?'' I asked.
''The human body carries an electrical charge. When you work on the bombs, if you're not careful, you can ignite them with the electricity in your fingers.''
''Do you always smoke hash before you work on the bombs?''
More vigorous nodding. ''It takes away the fear.''
Shafiullah told me he joined the army about five years ago, when he turned 18. He served for three years as a regular infantry soldier in the violent Pakistani border regions before volunteering to become an explosive-ordnance-disposal technician. ''I always wanted to be one,'' he said. ''I love when someone calls me an engineer.'' About a year ago, after graduating from a six-month training program taught by French and American soldiers, Shafiullah was deployed to Wardak. Since then, he estimated, he had disposed of roughly 50 bombs. ''Thanks to God I've never been hurt,'' he said.
I asked if any of the other engineers were less fortunate. Shafiullah said that he belonged to a team of 20 technicians and that during the past three months two were killed and eight badly injured. He also said that nine of his friends from the training course were now dead or maimed. Back on the road, one of the minesweepers called for the pickax. Shafiullah took a last drag before joining them. A few minutes later, the valley echoed with a tremendous boom.
The shooting started soon after: rifles, machine guns, rocket-propelled grenades. It was too far ahead to see exactly what was happening. Later I learned that a group of insurgents ambushed the lead element in the convoy, strafing a narrow stretch in the road from within a dense stand of trees. The soldiers responded forcefully -- with more and bigger weapons -- killing six people in the village where the attack originated. A little while later, not far from the first shootout, there was another. This time an Afghan soldier fired a rocket-propelled grenade at a group of gunmen, killing seven. According to the soldiers, all the dead were Taliban.
By the time I reached the site with Colonel Daowood, the convoy had already moved on, resuming its lurching penetration of the valley. Perhaps not coincidentally, the ambushes occurred near a small gas station that was the target of an American airstrike the night before. The owner of the gas station -- a Taliban leader named Gulam Ali, who Daowood said commanded several hundred insurgents in Chak -- was killed by a missile. Two old fuel pumps still stood out front, but the row of shops behind them was ruined: windows shattered, charred metal bars curled back like the melted tines of a plastic fork. Each shop offered its own little diorama of destruction. Hundreds of pill bottles scattered on a pharmacy floor; emptied shelves hanging vertically in a general store; an iron and a sewing machine standing improbably upright on a tailor's wooden table, among burned and tattered rolls of cloth.
Next to the gas station was Gulam Ali's home and headquarters: an immaculate compound centered on a courtyard with rosebushes and a deep freshwater well. An exterior staircase ascended to the bedroom. Inside I was surprised to find the walls pasted with posters illustrating idyllic scenes from some future civilization, in which sleek modern buildings were harmoniously incorporated into rugged natural landscapes. Or maybe it was Switzerland -- hard to say. Either way, it was odd to imagine Gulam Ali privately meditating on them. Nor did the inspirational quotes at the top of each poster lessen the oddness. ''We love life,'' one italicized blurb instructed, ''not because we are used to living, but because we are used to loving.'' And, ''Even if you are on the right track, you'll get run over if you just sit there.''
When I returned to the courtyard, Daowood announced that he was going to the village where the 13 insurgents had just been killed. ''It's Gulam Ali's village,'' he explained. ''I want to pay my respects.'' He headed into the trees with no protection other than the two teenage bodyguards who accompanied him everywhere. He wore no helmet or body armor (''I don't like them; they give me a headache''), and he carried no weapon. Instead he walked with his hands clasped behind his back, casually flipping a string of turquoise prayer beads. When we reached the compound that belonged to Gulam Ali's parents, where his relatives had gathered to mourn, Daowood told me to wait outside -- the presence of a foreigner would offend the family. When he emerged several minutes later, I was happy to be leaving the place. But as we made our way back to the main road, we encountered dozens of men congregated on a low knoll among the plain stone markers and colored flags of the village graveyard. It was a funeral for the Taliban, and the men regarded us with something less than brotherly affection. Daowood said, ''Keep walking.'' Then he addressed the funeral. ''The aircraft are coming back tonight!'' he shouted. ''The American Special Forces are coming! Leave this area! Don't stay here! If you stay, you might get killed!''
Immediately, the ceremony began to scatter, the men fleeing down the slope as swiftly as they could without betraying panic. ''The helicopters are coming!'' Daowood went on. ''The Special Forces will be here soon!''
At the time, the colonel's prompt dissolution of what appeared to be a potentially dangerous situation seemed to me as deft and inspired as his handling of the deranged man would a couple of days later. But something else was going on as well. Expressing his condolences to Gulam Ali's family, warning the people about a possible airstrike and night raid -- it was all part of Daowood's game. The more time I spent with him, the clearer it became that Daowood was practicing his own version of counterinsurgency, one that involved endearing himself to locals by characterizing as common enemies not only the Taliban but also the Americans and the Afghan government. In almost every village we visited, I watched Daowood rail against Kabul's political elite to rapt audiences of disgruntled farmers. Once, in a place known to abet insurgents, the colonel told a crowd: ''All the high-ranking officials in the government are thieves. They don't care about the country, the people. They take money from the foreigners and put it in their pockets. They make themselves fat. They go abroad, sleep in big houses, buy expensive cars and never think about the people. They have done nothing for this country.''
As with Daowood's occasional flights of rage, it was tough to tell just how much of this was theater and how much true belief. My sense was that Daowood was genuinely conflicted: a committed soldier who spent 10 years of his life in the service of a government he was profoundly disenchanted with. And he wasn't alone. Most soldiers I spoke to conspicuously avoided expressing any fondness for -- much less allegiance to -- their government. Of course, this is the same with other soldiers in other armies (imagine a U.S. Marine explaining his compulsion to enlist by citing a feeling of fidelity to the Bush or Obama administrations), but the nascency of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan makes its political leadership and national character uniquely synonymous. Put another way, in a government that has had only one president, you can't distinguish between corrupt individuals and a broken system. All of which raises the question: In such a country, how can you be both a detractor and a patriot, as Daowood and some of his men seemed clearly to be? The Marine ostensibly fights on behalf of American principles and institutions that transcend elected officials; on behalf of what did the colonel and these soldiers fight? Most of them, when I asked, answered with the word ''watan,'' or ''homeland.'' But what does the notion of a homeland mean for someone who has seen his ruled by monarchists, dictators, communists, mujahedeen, Islamic fundamentalists and Karzai?
When it grew dark, we occupied a half-built mud house on the outskirts of a small mountain village, and Colonel Daowood told us his story. The owner of the property had killed a chicken and prepared for us a large pot of soup. Daowood and his entourage huddled around the iridescent mantles of a kerosene lamp, passing the ladle around, hugging their wool field blankets against a near-freezing night.
Daowood's military career began three decades ago, when he fought the Russians in the tall mountains and narrow valleys of his native Paghman District. After the Soviet-backed government collapsed in 1992, rival mujahedeen groups turned viciously upon one another. While Kabul became the epicenter of a ferocious civil war, Paghman, just 20 minutes west of the city, remained relatively peaceful. Daowood stayed home, preferring not to enter a fray that was decimating the capital and its residents, with no end in sight. But in 1996, when the Taliban entered Kabul and ejected with unexpected ease each of its warring factions, Daowood took his wife and children to Panjshir Valley, an anti-Taliban stronghold where the warlord Ahmed Shah Massoud had retreated in preparation for a longer, harder fight. Although Massoud and his men were Tajiks and Daowood was a Pashtun (the ethnicity of the Taliban) -- and although the recent civil war inflamed ethnic animosities -- Daowood was received with open arms. Massoud gave his family a house and put Daowood in charge of 100 men.
More war followed for Daowood. Years of land mines and rockets, ambushes and close calls. Years of night operations in the orchards of the vast Shomali Plain -- a verdant land between Panjshir and Kabul. Years, finally, of much spilled blood but little ground lost or gained. And then came the year everything changed. When Daowood talks about that time -- after he and his comrades routed the Taliban with the help of American air power and special operators -- he grins the way you might at a memory of your naןver self. It's the optimism of those days that both embarrasses and saddens him, the feeling that Afghanistan had been born anew.
Daowood was among the tens of thousands of fighters in the so-called Northern Alliance -- a loose confederation of anti-Taliban militias loyal to Massoud and other commanders. Although Massoud himself was assassinated two days before 9/11, his successor, Mohammed Qasim Fahim, supposedly a drug trafficker, was installed as the defense minister for Hamid Karzai's interim government. Under Fahim, a majority of the Northern Alliance, including Daowood and his 100 men, became the first incarnation of the new Afghan military. While the United States remained committed to the ''light footprint'' approach championed by Bush and Rumsfeld -- eschewing any commitment of resources that might be construed as ''nation-building'' -- Fahim presided over the creation of a force that soon came to resemble the factionalism of the past far more than the nationalism of a future so eagerly anticipated by people like Daowood. As the International Crisis Group put it: ''Units became organs of patronage, rewarding allies and supporters with officer commissions. The result was a weak chain of command over a mix of militias plagued by high desertion rates and low operational capacity.''
Whatever power-jockeying and cronyism afflicted the fledgling military, the civilian government under President Karzai was looking even worse. After two years, weary and bitter, Daowood resigned. ''It was the corruption,'' he explained. ''It ruined everything. Everything was destroyed.'' While Daowood embraced a new life back in Paghman -- managing his family's land and enjoying the company of his wife and sons -- a resurgent Taliban began to exploit a growing disillusionment with the government and a meager deployment of security forces outside the capital. By 2006, there was no denying it: The insurgency had evolved from a lingering nuisance to a legitimate threat.
One day, an old friend from Panjshir, who was serving as a corps commander in the A.N.A., visited Daowood at his farm in Paghman. ''We argued a lot,'' Daowood recalled. ''I didn't want to be in the army anymore. I didn't want to fight for this government. When I explained this to him, my friend told me: 'If good men don't participate, the criminals will take over. We have to reclaim this country from them.' '' In the end, Daowood was convinced. Once more he left Paghman. Once more he took up arms.
When Daowood finished his story, I asked whether he really believed that the system was reformable. He thought for a while. Finally, he offered another reason for fighting -- one that rang somewhat truer. ''The government only steals money,'' he told me. ''At least they aren't against education or women or human rights or rule of law.''
The next morning, some soldiers found a Taliban flag and brought it to Daowood. It wasn't much: Arabic script scrawled in blue ballpoint pen on a square of white bedsheet tied with twine to a stick. Daowood slashed it with his knife and tried setting it on fire. The cloth was slow to catch. While the soldiers fussed with cardboard and kindling, Daowood received a call from the American advisers at Dash-e Towp. They wanted to remind him to begin tearing down the check posts. Daowood was incredulous; he still couldn't believe it. ''What nonsense is this?'' he said when he hung up. ''Do they want to hand Afghanistan to the Taliban?'' The other soldiers looked just as galled. They sullenly watched the flag absorb a green lick of flame, shrivel and burn. ''After these check posts are destroyed, we won't be able to enter this valley,'' Daowood said.
All the Afghans in Wardak, it seemed, shared Daowood's contempt for the decision to close the check posts. When I met with Wardak's provincial governor, Abdul Majid Khogyani, in Kabul, he told me: ''I was a strong opponent of this idea. The police commander of Wardak and the National Directorate of Security chief were also against it. We know this will not work. The result of this strategy is that the Taliban have become stronger. Without the check posts, the Taliban will easily penetrate these areas. And once that happens, it is very difficult to clear them out again.'' Majid was convinced that the realignment of troops had been forced on the A.N.A. command by NATO -- a suspicion held by many Afghan officers I spoke to. ''The local population are asking why NATO would deliberately provide the Taliban with such an opportunity,'' the governor said. NATO has declined to comment on its involvement.
In Chak Valley, only one A.N.A. position would remain -- the most distant outpost from the highway, manned by a contingent of roughly 100. That afternoon, when the convoy reached this last outpost, a fresh company relieved the bedraggled-looking men who had been stationed there for the past 12 months, collaborating with a U.S. Special Forces team, struggling to gain a foothold. Every one of them painted a similarly bleak picture of near-daily fighting against a more numerous guerrilla army. Mile after mile of mountains and forest was owned wholly by the insurgents. Out in that big wilderness, there was even a Taliban weapons bazaar, where insurgent fighters bought and sold Kalashnikovs and rockets and machine guns and grenades.
The question hovered like a bad smell: How would the Afghan soldiers who remained deep in Chak survive (or perhaps more accurately: What would they be able to accomplish beyond merely surviving?) once every check post between them and Highway 1 was razed? Severing entirely their already embattled position from the foot of the valley would be simple enough. After all, there was only one way in and out. As if to highlight this uncomfortable fact, a local informant called Daowood as soon as the convoy started to make its way back in the direction from which it had come. A number of bombs, the informant warned, were buried somewhere up ahead.
Shafiullah and his team headed to the front, and the procession of Humvees and trucks slowed to a crawl. Right away, the engineers found a copper wire attached to a massive I.E.D. buried two feet underground. A few minutes later, they found another. And then another. As soon as Shafiullah blew up the third bomb, Colonel Daowood's informant called back to say that there were probably ''many more,'' though he was uncertain where. By now it was dark, and we still had miles to travel before reaching the relative security of an open area nearer the highway, where the battalion was supposed to bed down. Fifty feet or so ahead of the lead vehicle Shafiullah knelt in the dim beams of the headlights scratching at the dirt with his pickax. After a while there was some hollering and a disorderly hustle toward the rear. The explosion that followed was so powerful that bits of earth lashed our backs in a warm wave.
No one was hurt, and the convoy started forward again. Then it stopped again. While Shafiullah went back to work, I joined a group of soldiers sitting on the remains of an old Soviet tank. Someone produced a joint. The mood was jolly. It turned out the soldiers belonged to the company stationed since last winter at the remotest outpost in Chak. They were glad to be rotating out -- even if it meant swapping one deadly place for another. Most of them were Pashtuns from eastern Afghanistan who served for many years and had wives and children to whom they sent their salaries and saw once every several months. The soldiers hoped to get some leave when they returned to Dash-e Towp -- but visiting home, they said, was a mission in itself. Stretches of the highway between Dash-e Towp and Kabul were treacherous; many soldiers had been abducted and murdered by insurgents on their way to see their families. In the past you could dress in the traditional shalwar kameez, hire a taxi and pose as a civilian. But now the Taliban had spies who alerted them when soldiers headed out. The only option was to catch a ride on a convoy, and those could be rare. Recently, the soldiers said, one of their lieutenants lost his infant son to an illness: though he was from Kapisa Province -- a short drive north by car -- it took him 20 days to get back.
Eventually Shafiullah found and detonated the fourth bomb, and the soldiers on the tank -- high as kites by then -- returned to the road and continued on. It was 1 in the morning by the time they reached their destination. On the way, they had to stop again and again for Shafiullah's team to excavate and blow up I.E.D.'s -- 11 in total. At some point after midnight the engineers got sloppy, igniting the C-4 on one bomb before Shafiullah could escape the blast radius. The pressure wave collapsed a mud-brick wall he was walking by, crushing his ankle. When I saw Shafiullah the next morning, his pant leg was in tatters and he was limping. His leg looked badly swollen. He hadn't seen a medic yet and didn't plan to.
The ground froze solid during the night and Shafiullah -- who like most of the men in the battalion was never issued a sleeping bag -- got no more than a cold hour's rest. Nevertheless, while he waited in line to collect his breakfast (a plastic bag containing a hard piece of bread and a boiled egg and a mini-carton of coffee creamer), he seemed in high spirits. ''I told you I'd never been hurt before, and now I'm hurt,'' Shafiullah said with a laugh. ''I was close! But God saved me.''
This was the day that Daowood brought his men up the mountain to a village called Ali Shah and found it deserted except for the deranged man who danced for him. Among the Afghan soldiers, Ali Shah was infamous -- an insurgent sanctuary where no government forces had dared to venture in more than a decade. (''Even the women are Taliban!'' one sergeant told me.) Daowood had received intelligence that there would be a wedding in the village that day with several insurgent commanders in attendance. He said he wanted to pace the operation to crash the wedding in time for lunch.
When Daowood asked where the Taliban went, the deranged man pointed to a distant hillside where a large group of villagers had gathered outside a mosque. Daowood and his men jumped in their trucks and headed that way. I rode in the back of a Toyota pickup with a middle-aged machine-gunner named Fazil. It turned out that Fazil was the lieutenant the soldiers on the tank had mentioned the night before -- the one who had been unable to get home in time for his son's burial. As we talked, there was something deeply familiar about the way Fazil described his village in Kapisa Province. He might have been a U.S. Marine reminiscing about the family ranch in Texas. The river was wide and clear, bountiful with fish. The people were kind; the air was fresh; the fruit was sweet.
Fazil's education in the peculiarities of war began when he was 12, during the jihad. One day, while he was with his father and uncle at the local bazaar, a foot patrol of Russian commandos -- or Russian soldiers who Fazil assumed were commandos because of the ski masks they were wearing -- opened fire on the villagers. Fazil's uncle bled out and died on the ground in front of him; Fazil's father also took a bullet but survived. Several years later, a jet from the Soviet-backed government launched a missile at Fazil's home that killed both of his parents; shortly thereafter, Fazil joined the mujahedeen in Panjshir led by Massoud. During a battle with Soviet fighters, Fazil was shot in the leg and had to be taken to a hospital in Kabul. There the government asked him to switch sides. Fazil agreed and for a year fought for the national army against his former comrades. When I asked how he could volunteer for the same force that killed his parents, Fazil said: ''The mujahedeen knew I was with the government the whole time. I was giving them information.'' After the government collapsed, Fazil went back to Panjshir and rejoined with Massoud.
This capacity for switching sides, betraying sides, playing sides, often simultaneously, always baffled the foreign forces in Afghanistan. The complex logic of Afghanistan's ever-shifting allegiances is simply inscrutable to most outsiders; we have never really understood whom we're fighting or why they're fighting us. I once went on a mission in a volatile eastern province with a platoon of American soldiers and a member of the U.S. Army's Human Terrain System -- a historian with a doctorate and an assault rifle whose job it was to map which anti-Soviet mujahedeen groups the elders in the area identified with. Some Afghan troops were there as well, and I remember the mystified looks on their faces as this soldier-professor grilled (through an interpreter) one graybeard after another about the commanders they fought under 20 years ago.
Daowood's method was different. When a fighting-age male struck him as suspicious, the colonel would use his thumbs and index fingers to pull open both of the man's eyelids. Then he would lean close and stare searchingly. Usually, after several seconds, as though he had suddenly found precisely what he was looking for, Daowood would declare, in mock surprise, ''He's Taliban!''
It was a joke, of course -- one that mostly made fun of the Americans. A few years ago, the coalition embarked on an ambitious enterprise to record in an electronic database the biometric information of hundreds of thousands of Afghan citizens, and a hallmark of American patrols has subsequently been the lining up of villagers to digitally register their eyes and fingerprints. Daowood's faux iris scan was in part an acknowledgment of the A.N.A.'s inferior technology. But it was also a dig at the coalition's somewhat desperate reliance on technology. Where Daowood's interactions with villagers were always intimate, it is hard to imagine a more clinical and alienating dynamic between two people than that of the NATO service member aiming his Hand-held Interagency Identity Detection Equipment at the face of a rural Afghan farmer. In such moments, the difference in the field between the U.S. and Afghan soldier is far starker than that of the foreigner and the native. It is more akin to the difference in the ocean between a scuba diver and a fish.
For example: it never occurred to me that Daowood was being entirely serious when he said he wanted to arrive at the wedding in time for lunch. But as soon as we reached the gathering on the hillside in Ali Shah, we were invited into a house and served generous plates of stewed lamb and rice. Daowood dutifully commenced his anti-establishment diatribe, telling me, in a voice loud enough for everyone to hear: ''These are good people, all of them. If the government worked for them, if the government helped them, they wouldn't fight us. The government officials should come to places like this. They know nothing of the people's lives outside of Kabul.'' When one villager added that ''the ministers put all the money in their own accounts, they build themselves nice houses and buy nice cars,'' Daowood nodded in sympathetic agreement.
Just outside, meanwhile, some soldiers standing guard discovered a canvas sack full of rocket-propelled grenades stashed behind a boulder. A group of men were spotted fleeing into the mountains, and the day's fighting began.
Late that night, after the rest of the battalion went to sleep, Daowood set off into a Taliban-controlled village on foot, accompanied by four guards. He wanted to meet with a local Talib, who was also a paid informant. He never said so explicitly -- ''he's an old friend'' and ''he gives me information'' was all he allowed -- but I had the sense this was the man who warned Daowood about the bombs in the road. There was not much of a moon and just enough starlight to see the ground beneath our feet. As we made our way over a steep hill, along a creek, through a field and into winding streets, a chorus of dogs began to howl, and the four soldiers Daowood dragged along grew nervous. ''Don't worry,'' Daowood kept telling them. ''We're close.''
When we reached the Talib's house, a young boy ushered us into a long narrow room dimly lighted by a gas lantern. Pink lace curtains hung over the windows; plush cushions lined the walls; gaudily decorative carpets covered the floor. The informant was a middle-aged man affecting the usual beard and turban. He embraced Daowood and gestured for us to sit. The boy brought tea and then platters of rice and meat and bread. After a while, Daowood said: ''We're closing the check posts tomorrow. We're pulling out of here.''
''That will be fine,'' the man said. ''The aircraft were searching here last night.''
''Just stay inside,'' Daowood told him.
His phone rang. When he hung up, Daowood announced, ''There's going to be an ambush tomorrow.'' And to the informant: ''Tomorrow we're going to search this area.''
The informant nodded. ''There won't be any problem.''
The next day, there was in fact an ambush -- even while the bulldozers and backhoes were leveling the check posts. We were heading up a tight canyon, along the banks of a shallow stream, when rockets and machine guns echoed up ahead. By now, most of the soldiers were ragged with fatigue. Over the past four days, they had walked some 30 miles, stayed up shivering through frigid nights, eaten little more than bread and rice. And they had fought and killed people, too. As Daowood rushed ahead at a brisk pace toward the gunfire, we passed one soldier after another sitting on the side of the trail, leaning against a rock, flushed and spent. ''Don't stop!'' Daowood urged them. ''You're in the enemy's country now! Move like a lion!''
And for the most part -- even if not exactly lionlike -- the soldiers got up and pushed on.
It's too early to tell what the Afghan National Army will look like on Dec. 31, 2014. No doubt its level of readiness for the uncertain future will vary hugely from region to region, unit to unit. But it is a mistake to dismiss or disparage the Afghan soldier, as is often done by foreigners in Afghanistan. After the ambush (three insurgents were injured; no soldiers), I walked toward the highway, which we could see through the bare trees at the foot of the valley, alongside a young medic from Daykundi Province named Abdul Karim. Like most of the people from Daykundi, Karim was Hazara, one of Afghanistan's ethnic minorities. Because they follow the Shia branch of Islam, and because their distinct facial features make them easily recognizable, Hazaras are uniquely vulnerable to militant Sunni fundamentalists. In Afghanistan, this has certainly been true with the Taliban, who, during their rise to power, massacred Hazaras by the thousands. ''For my people,'' Karim told me, ''it is important to serve in this army.'' Almost all of the men in his family, he said, enlisted as soon as they were old enough. Twenty-eight of Karim's brothers and cousins wore the uniform.
There might have been a time early in the war when most American soldiers and Marines genuinely believed that they were fighting to protect their homeland, their watan. But those days are over now; they have been for a while. You can feel it just as surely as you can feel that for soldiers like Karim they will never end.
Almost as soon as we got back to Dash-e Towp, I overheard some U.S. officers loudly complaining about the inability of Afghan soldiers to make appointments on time. Afghan soldiers do have difficulty making appointments on time, it's true. They also don't like to stand in straight lines or dress according to regulation or march in step or do so many of the things intrinsic to a Western notion of professional soldiering. When a lieutenant calls a formation of Afghan privates to attention, they will inevitably resemble, as my drill sergeant used to say, ''a soup sandwich.'' But they will also accept a much higher level of risk than any coalition force ever has. Their ranks are filled with tough and brave men who run toward the fight without body armor or helmets or armored vehicles and sleep on the frozen ground without sleeping bags and dig up I.E.D.'s with a pickax and often go hungry and seldom complain.
It was dark by the time Daowood returned to the base; he wanted to be the last man in. When I visited him in his room, he was sitting on the floor, drinking tea. A small TV played quietly in the corner, and as we talked I heard a broadcaster mention the news: yesterday, Barack Obama was re-elected president. I pointed this out to Daowood, who wasn't much interested. ''They're all the same to us,'' he said. Then, seeing I was taking notes, he added, ''We just want someone who will help Afghanistan.'' But the colonel seemed to know that in the end that job would be his.

GEORGE SAUNDERS
This line from George Saunders resonated with me most: ''What a powerful thing to know: that one's own desires are mappable onto strangers.'' If we could really live that insight, the world would be better -- to see the great, often unbridgeable distance between yourself and ''the other'' turn into a roadway paved with understanding. To recognize, despite the difference, or maybe because of it, some common humanity between us. What a marvelous profile. Made me take ''Pastoralia'' off my bookshelf and start reading again. KATHLEEN B. JONES, PH.D., Bristol, England, posted on nytimes.com 
The literary history of Syracuse, N.Y., is more important than most readers realize. Joel Lovell beautifully portrays one of Syracuse's most original fiction writers. Illuminating is Lovell's exploration of Saunders's ties to David Foster Wallace. Pointing to a basement apartment, Saunders is quoted as saying: ''That's where Dave wrote 'Infinite Jest.' There should be a plaque there.'' But while Wallace wrote with exceptional lucidity in Syracuse, according to D. T. Max's recent biography, most of the novel was drafted in Boston. Would Wallace have agreed to any markings of his time in a place he called ''Drearacuse,'' the gray-lit center of heartbreak for him, a place from which he so often sought escape? MICHAEL PAUL THOMAS, Asst. Dean, Wayne D. McMurray School of Humanities and Social Sciences, Monmouth University, West Long Branch, N.J.
FORGIVENESS IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE?
This is a tragic story of two young lives -- one shot to death, the other sentenced to a long prison term. What makes it even more tragic is that it never needed to happen. Had Conor McBride not had easy access to a gun in his parents' home, he would not be in prison, and Ann Grosmaire would be alive and able to look forward to a career and a family. What better example is there for stricter gun laws? ANNE E. CITRON, Beverly Hills, Calif.
By his own admission, McBride hit Grosmaire several times during their relationship; each time, Grosmaire clearly ''forgave'' him enough to stay. Restorative justice potentially allows the cycle of abuse and forgiveness that fuels domestic violence to enter the courtroom. While I do not doubt the sincerity of the Grosmaires' forgiveness of McBride, nor begrudge them the peace they have found, I cannot agree that their feelings have a place in the justice system. ELSPETH GREEN, Princeton, N.J
'BE WRONG AS FAST AS YOU CAN'
I'm a metal artist with great ideas, but I'm trapped by easy success at making silver jewelry. My days start with fabulous concepts swirling in my head but are spent making fattening breakfasts, carrying in firewood and taking afternoon naps. Yesterday at the Met, I saw photos of Matisse's paintings as they ''evolved.'' He would continually paint over his female figures -- one day slumped, the next erect; the face articulated, then later a squiggle as if by a second-grader. They were ''mistakes'' leading to what I thought were simple sketches but now see as refinements. He was being wrong as fast as he could. Now I sit, having read Hugo Lindgren's essay (it was easier than making a fattening breakfast). A personal sea change has occurred. I wish I could convey my thanks, but the only way to do that is with my paintbrushes or carving chisels or torches. Just as soon as I get this smoky bacon into that iron skillet.

Movies In the Age Of Obama

BYLINE: By A. O. SCOTT and MANOHLA DARGIS

SECTION: Section AR; Column 0; Arts and Leisure Desk; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 2219 words

FOUR years ago, on the historic occasion of Barack Obama's first inauguration, we took a look at the good, bad and outrageous movie characters who helped make his election possible. The road to the White House, we wrote, hadn't just been paved by Mr. Obama's speeches, innovative campaign strategies and the hopefulness of a majority of voters, but also by decades of African-American men in movies. From the class striving of Sidney Poitier's everyman in the classic film ''A Raisin in the Sun'' to Will Smith's messianic loners in recent titles like ''I Am Legend,'' the movies have ennobled, consecrated, glorified, immortalized and, most important, normalized the figure of the black man. 
Now, on the eve of a second Obama term, the images are more complex, and in some ways blurrier. Politically and personally this president functions as a screen onto which different Americans project their fears and fantasies. From the right, the picture is often of a monster whose policies are steps on a scary road to socialism or some other exotic form of tyranny. Many liberals, by contrast, have expressed disappointment at his willingness to compromise with Republicans and his reluctance to fight. At different times and from various angles Mr. Obama is a fiery orator, an aloof intellectual, a policy nerd and a shrewd strategist. He is notoriously resistant to sketch-comedy impersonation and also, perhaps, to simple pop-cultural appropriation.
Last year in The New York Review of Books the critic J. Hoberman wondered when we would see an ''Obama-inflected Hollywood cinema.'' ''The longing for Obama (or an Obama),'' he wrote, ''can be found in two prescient 2008 movies,'' citing ''Wall-E'' and ''Milk'' as releases about creative community organizers, with Harvey Milk also a political symbol of hope. It may be too soon to identify an Obama Cinema, but the president's second inauguration seems like an appropriate time to try. His first term wasn't easy for Hollywood, representationally; the most visible evidence for this seeming paralysis was the whiteout that descended over the 2011 Oscars, where African-Americans were conspicuous only by their absence.
Subsequent Oscar nominations for ''The Help'' partly rectified the color imbalance. This year race is firmly back on the table with movies like ''Lincoln'' and ''Django Unchained.'' Yet much like Mr. Obama, who has rarely made race a topic of conversation, the current nominees for best picture speak to other issues, including war, the economy and just about everything else. Some of the connections between politics and movies are obvious, but we wanted to go beyond the topical resonance of films like ''Zero Dark Thirty'' and enter into the realms of allegory and national mythology. Here is our highly preliminary, wildly speculative thematic guide to American cinema in the Obama Era.
Our current bout of LINCOLNMANIA may have begun that frigid day in 2007 when Mr. Obama announced in front of the Old State Capitol in Springfield, Ill., that he was running for president. Since then Lincoln books have continued to pour in; the Ford Motor Company has taken Honest Abe out of cold storage for its rebranded Lincoln; and he has become an unexpected box-office draw with Steven Spielberg's political procedural, ''Lincoln.'' That Daniel Day-Lewis's grave and wily interpretation of the mature president outperformed a younger, ax-wielding Abe in the gonzo ''Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter'' wasn't just a surprise, including at the box office, it was also one of the biggest film stories of 2012.
Literal Lincolns have been few on the big screen, but variations on the Lincolnesque have emerged, from the leadership of Sheriff Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks, a distant relative of Abe) in ''Toy Story 3'' to Jamie Foxx's avenger in Quentin Tarantino's ''Django Unchained.'' In its virtuous violence ''Django'' at times can be seen as an elaboration on a crucial passage from Lincoln's second inaugural speech: ''Yet, if God wills that it continue, until all the wealth piled by the bond-man's 250 years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash, shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said 3,000 years ago, so still it must be said, 'The judgments of the Lord, are true and righteous altogether.' ''
The Lincoln in Mr. Spielberg and Tony Kushner's film represents the triumph of the moral good, achieved through rational discourse, the law and backroom wrangling. In Quentin Tarantino's ''Django,'' by contrast, the salt-and-pepper team played by Christoph Waltz and Mr. Foxx embodies a blood-drenched fantasy of justice achieved through the rule of the gun. It's a fantasy that has deep roots in American history, on screen and off. What these period pictures have in common is a sense that righting our wrongs is a shared burden. Or, as Nick Fury, in describing another battle between good and evil, puts it: ''There came a day, a day unlike any other, when Earth's mightiest heroes found themselves united against a common threat.''
''Marvel's The Avengers'' might have been called ''Team of Rivals'' -- the title of the book, by Doris Kearns Goodwin, that was one of the sources for ''Lincoln.'' And Joss Whedon's Marvel costume party is, like Mr. Spielberg's historical costume drama, largely about an urgent response to a political crisis. It is also about COMMUNITY ORGANIZING, as Fury mobilizes a fractious group of individuals whom he must persuade to pursue a set of common interests.
As such, ''The Avengers'' may be the exemplary Obama Era superhero movie, replacing the figure of the solitary, shadowy paladin with a motley assortment of oddballs and, despite the title, focusing less on vengeance than on interplanetary peacekeeping. A similar ethic informs ''X-Men: First Class,'' which takes place around the time of Mr. Obama's birth (at the height of the cold war and the civil rights movement) and which shows how the idealistic pursuit of justice and tolerance can end up tragically divided between radical and conciliatory impulses. (The philosophical split between Magneto and Charles Xavier mirrors that between the moderate mediator Mr. Obama claims to be and the angry militant that Dinesh D'Souza's documentary ''2016: Obama's America'' insists he really is.)
The ideal of community and the threats to its survival are powerful themes in these anxious times, when economic upheaval and environmental catastrophe are ever-present worries, and when the values of comity and neighborliness can seem hard to sustain. ''Beasts of the Southern Wild'' and ''Promised Land,'' both released in 2012, imagine emblematic American landscapes -- the bayous of Louisiana and the green rural towns of the Northeast -- as ecologically and socially fragile places, easily destroyed by hundred-year storms or million-dollar fracking payoffs. Another, ''The Descendants'' (set in Hawaii, the president's birthplace), locates the struggle between the pursuit of profit and the desire to hold onto other values within the conscience of a lawyer played by George Clooney, the president's contemporary and a quintessential Obama Era movie star. An earlier movie, ''The Company Men'' showed the effects of hard times on the less picturesque world of middle-class suburbia.
THE GREAT RECESSION ''officially'' ended in 2009, but that hasn't dramatically thinned unemployment lines or buoyed the global economy. Historically American movies often take on class in ''little micropolitical movies like 'The Postman Always Rings Twice,' '' to borrow an observation from the German filmmaker Christian Petzold. Newer fiction tales like ''Warrior'' (about brothers battling in the lower middle class) and ''Arbitrage'' (about a nose-diving venture capitalist) as well as documentaries like ''Inside Job'' have taken on the economy and its fallout but largely attract more critical love than paying customers. One of the few class-conscious titles recently to hit the top of the box office was Steven Soderbergh's independently produced ''Magic Mike,'' about a stripper whose offstage dreams seem thwarted when he's turned down for a bank loan.
The big studios still shy away from openly taking on class, unless the issue comes swaddled in period rags and a comfortable historical distance, as in ''Les Misיrables'' and even the last ''Robin Hood'' was more about the rights of the rich than the privations of the poor. When the big studios do notice bad times, it's often with the cluelessness of people who whine about their money woes while driving a Lexus. That said, glimpses of class conflict emerged amid the shadows of ''The Dark Knight Rises,'' which riffs on the French Revolution, nods at the Occupy movement and glances back at the gangster movies of the 1930s, in which struggles for power and money were accompanied by the rat-a-tat of Tommy guns.
Of course, ''The Dark Knight Rises'' is also a WAR movie, and Mr. Obama has been (to cite his predecessor's self-description) a wartime president. ''The Dark Knight Rises'' imagines a Hobbesian state of social chaos, a more complicated situation than pictured by its prequel, ''The Dark Knight,'' which is in some ways the central movie of the Bush years, with its sharply drawn lines of good and evil. Batman's fight with the Joker was as personal and apocalyptic as Harry Potter's epochal struggle with Voldemort, which came to an on-screen conclusion in the same year that Osama bin Laden, the prime evildoer of the Bush era, met his violent end.
The big movie about that event -- Kathryn Bigelow's ''Zero Dark Thirty'' -- was pre-emptively attacked as a piece of election-year Obama-boosting, and then criticized, for seeming to imply that waterboarding and other brutal forms of interrogation produced some of the intelligence that led to Bin Laden. Mr. Obama appears on screen briefly, but the film's action takes place far from the centers of political power, in Central Asian ''black sites'' and then in the cubicle warrens of C.I.A. headquarters in Langley, Va. Its mood is hardly triumphant (Ms. Bigelow and the screenwriter, Mark Boal, originally planned to make a film about the failure, during the Bush presidency, to catch Bin Laden), and its message is far more equivocal than some commentators have supposed. The world of ''Zero Dark Thirty'' is one of shadows, ethical compromises and constant danger, and though it ends with victory -- as most American war movies have -- it also ends in tears.
Movie audiences tend to prefer symbolic, fantastical wars, with intergalactic robots (in the subliminally anti-Obama ''Transformer'' movies, the third of which lays waste to the president's adopted hometown, Chicago), alien life forms and futuristic settings. But those films have nuances of their own. Both James Cameron's ''Avatar'' and Rupert Wyatt's ''Rise of the Planet of the Apes'' scramble the usual good guy/bad guy dichotomy, suggesting that, as Pogo once observed, the enemy is us.
That surely is one lesson of ''The Help,'' ''Lincoln'' and ''Django Unchained.'' The passionate arguments over these movies partly confirmed that the postracial utopia in ''Avatar'' remains as much a dream deferred as mind-tripping in someone else's body. Yet even as pundits and the public wrestle over representations of America's torturously segregated past, some filmmakers are imagining a present that looks like America, where 15 percent of all new marriages are now interracial. The historic uptick in such relationships is reflected in recent movies in which RACE matters, as it always does, but is not necessarily the topic of on-screen conversation, as in ''The Social Network,'' ''Flight,'' ''Celeste and Jesse Forever,'' ''Rise of the Planet of the Apes,'' ''The Words'' and ''Yelling to the Sky.''
There is progress in movies like these, as well as in youth-bait franchises like ''The Fast and the Furious'' and a winning comedy like ''Bridesmaids,'' another movie in which interracial couples are an unremarkable given. Even so, big studios overwhelmingly remain reluctant to incorporate interracial couples as the main narrative event. Seen in the larger context of such romantic homogeneity, the heartthrob figure of Jacob the wolf boy, played by Taylor Lautner, in ''The Twilight'' series feels unexpectedly, well, important. Putting aside Mr. Lautner's own heritage (he has said that he's part American Indian), the fact is that millions of girls, women and gay men have united in a rainbow coalition of lust to transform Jacob into a wildly popular pinup. A gross of $1 billion and counting signals progress of a kind.
The year 2012 culminated with a sigh of relief for believers in supposed Maya end-of-the-world prophecies. But intimations of apocalypse have figured heavily in the popular imagination of the past four years. Real-world disasters (hurricanes, earthquakes, wars) have been mirrored in movies about rampant zombies, planetary collisions, killer epidemics and other harbingers of human extinction. The future -- as depicted in ''The Hunger Games,'' ''The Book of Eli,'' ''Contagion'' and ''Cloud Atlas,'' among others -- looks very scary indeed. These outsize fears may be the flip side of the extravagant hope of 2008, or exaggerated versions of the real challenges that we will face over the next four years.

Change Comes: After 4 Years, Friends See Shifts in the Obamas

BYLINE: By JODI KANTOR

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 1596 words

Barack and Michelle Obama have spent more than a thousand days on display before the nation's eyes, but the personal changes they have undergone can be hard to detect.
Up close, though, those who know the Obamas say they can see an accumulation of small shifts in the president and the first lady since they walked the inaugural parade route four years ago. The man who wanted to change the nature of Washington now warns job candidates that it is hard to get anything done there. Not so long ago, he told others that he did not need a presidential library, a tribute to himself costing hundreds of millions of dollars. Now a former aide, Susan Sher, is quietly eyeing possibilities for him in Chicago.
The first lady who wanted to forge connections with her new city found that even viewing the cherry blossoms required a hat, sunglasses and wheedling the Secret Service. In a demonstration of how difficult it can be for any president or first lady to sustain relationships, Mrs. Obama stopped taking on girls in a mentorship program she founded because of concerns that other teenagers would envy the lucky advisees, according to an aide. 
When the president returned from consoling families of teachers and children killed in the Newtown, Conn., massacre -- he wept as they handed him photos and told him stories of victim after victim -- aides could see in his face the toll of absorbing the nation's traumas. ''This is what I do,'' Mr. Obama told them.
''This position has perhaps cost him more on a personal, and even energic, level than most of his predecessors, because he was most entirely an outsider,'' observed the playwright Tony Kushner, a supporter who recently dined with Mr. Obama to discuss the film ''Lincoln,'' for which Mr. Kushner wrote the screenplay.
The Obamas have gained and lost in their four years in the White House, becoming seasoned professionals instead of newcomers, more conventional, with a contracted sense of possibility. They are steady characters, not given to serial self-reinvention. Yet in interviews, current and former White House and campaign aides, donors and friends from Chicago said they could see how the president and the first lady had been affected by their roles.
Describing them, they used phrases like: more confident but more scarred. More isolated. Less hesitant about directing staff members, whether butlers or highest-level advisers. Gratified by re-election, which the Obamas view as sweet vindication, and bloodier-minded when it comes to beating Republicans. And Mr. Obama has learned that his presidency will be shaped by unanticipated events -- ''locusts,'' one former aide called them, for the way they swarm without warning.
Mr. Obama never wanted to be an ordinary politician -- there was a time when Mrs. Obama could barely use that noun to describe her husband -- and his advisers resist the idea that he has succumbed to standard Washington practice. Some donors and aides give an ''if only'' laugh at the idea that the couple now follows political ritual more closely: this is a president who still has not had Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton to dinner but holds lunches to discuss moral philosophy with the fellow Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel.
''He thinks about destiny in human terms,'' Mr. Wiesel said in an interview.
Still, others say the Obamas have become more relaxed schmoozers, more at ease with the porous line between the political and social, more willing to reveal themselves. They have recently begun inviting more outsiders into their private living quarters, including Mr. Kushner, Steven Spielberg and Daniel Day-Lewis at the ''Lincoln'' dinner. At a dinner in late November to thank top campaign fund-raisers, the first couple was like a bride and groom, bantering and traveling from table to table to accept congratulations and good wishes for the years ahead, making sly jokes that guests would not repeat for publication.
Even Mr. Obama's speech has changed a bit, close observers say. Though he still disdains Washington, he often sounds less like a disapproving outsider and more like a participant. One former aide was startled to hear Mr. Obama use ''impact'' as a verb, a particular tendency in the capital. Another longtime adviser said he was struck during the 2011 debt ceiling negotiations when Mr. Obama grew offended that House Speaker John A. Boehner did not return his multiple phone calls. The old Barack Obama would have thought the who-calls-whom protocol was stupid, the adviser said, but ''the world that he inhabits now is the world of inside-the-Beltway maneuvering.''
In video footage of Mr. Obama as president, the contrasts can be subtle but amusing. At his first Thanksgiving turkey pardoning ceremony in 2009, the president played along, but then paused to distance himself from what he was doing and hint that he found the tradition ridiculous. ''There are certain days that remind me of why I ran for this office,'' he said. ''And then there are moments like this -- where I pardon a turkey and send it to Disneyland.'' Cut to the same ceremony, three years later, and cue Mr. Obama promoting a contest over which bird to pardon and giggling just a little. ''You can't maintain your day-to-day cynicism about that stuff,'' said Arun Chaudhary, the former White House videographer, because many Americans cherish White House rituals.
What Mr. Obama wants to achieve this term is pretty clear: a fiscal deal and overhauls of gun and immigration laws, steps to address climate change and less restrictive voter identification laws. But what Mrs. Obama wants is more of a mystery. In almost every appearance, she sounds warm, unpretentious notes; on Friday, she continued her Twitter banter with Ellen DeGeneres over who could do more push-ups.
That informal tone can mask how disciplined she is. Though many surrounding the Obamas say she has changed far more than her husband, mastering a role she initially found uncomfortable, she still treats the job of first lady like a dangerous country through which she must navigate safe passage. The woman who never wanted to live in the bubble now uses it to protect herself, according to friends and former aides, preparing her public activities in 6- and 12-month strategic plans, rarely saying anything unscripted. First ladies are often figures of comfort, but she did not address the Newtown tragedy, beyond two brief letters she published, even though some of her fans were clamoring for the self-described ''mom in chief'' to do more.
In recent weeks, Mrs. Obama and her advisers have been discussing whether to expand her work beyond childhood obesity and military families and how to capitalize on her popularity. On Friday, she threw herself into her husband's new effort to organize supporters, introducing the group, Organizing for Action, in an announcement video. (The effort did not seem to garner as much attention as her new hairstyle, which set off headlines like ''Michelle Obama's Bangs Are a Total Shock to the System.'')
Mrs. Obama cannot wait too long to set out on a new course: the Obamas will soon have more time behind them in the White House than in front of them. The rituals they introduced are now matters of tradition instead of innovation. At their White House Seder, the small group of mostly African-American and Jewish attendees reads the Emancipation Proclamation right before welcoming Elijah, just as the year before. The president played basketball on Election Day 2012, as he did on most of the voting days in 2008. But this time it felt different: the men older, the action slower, a reunion game with everyone talking about the old days, said John Rogers Jr., a longtime friend who joined in.
Mr. Obama's entire career has been about getting to the next stage: if he could only become a lawyer, and then a public official, and then a United States senator, and then president, he could create real change. But soon there will be no higher job to reach for, and aides say there is an all-business quality to the Obamas now, a contrast with the sense of possibility that hung over the first inauguration. Early in the presidency, Mr. Obama would sometimes spend hours polishing ceremonial speeches, like one for Abraham Lincoln's bicentennial; now, the president has a more finely honed sense of how to use his precious time, said Adam Frankel, a former speechwriter. When Mr. Obama walked off the stage on election night, he did not pause to exult; instead, he wanted to talk about the impact of outside spending in that night's Congressional races, said Patrick Gaspard, the director of the Democratic National Committee.
But Mr. Obama also knows now that he is not fully in control of his fate, that the presidency will continue to bring tasks that no one could ever anticipate. Mr. and Mrs. Obama were supposed to spend the evening of Dec. 16 enjoying their daughter Sasha's ''Nutcracker'' recital. Instead, the president was making condolence calls in cordoned-off rooms at Newtown High School.
''Words don't exist'' to describe the grief on his face as he approached the families, said Sarah D'Avino, whose sister Rachel died protecting her students. The president asked each family to describe the relative who died, paying special attention to the victims' mothers. Mourning parents handed him pictures to carry back to the White House, and he told them that the children were beautiful, that the teachers were national heroes.
Moments later, he was smiling, on cue. One of his photographers was on hand, as always, and despite everything, the bereaved wanted pictures with the president.

Despite Gun Smuggling, New Controls Are Feared

In the recent debate about stricter gun control, some Mexican and American officials saw a sliver of hope -- that such laws might curb the flow of illegal weapons over the United States' southern border.
''I hope that whatever we are going to do in trying to protect our gun rights but at the same time regulate the legal ownership of weapons is going to have a component on guns that are being smuggled out of the country so easily now and causing the carnage,'' said Alonzo Peסa, the former deputy director of Immigrations and Customs Enforcement who has also served as a Department of Homeland Security attachי at the United States Embassy in Mexico City.
But the national debate, coupled with the Obama administration's proposals to tighten gun laws, has only fortified the ranks of Second Amendment proponents in Texas, who say the border states that are a main source for weapons in Mexico's drug war are not responsible for the thousands of murders in that country since 2006. 
After President Obama called last week for more background checks on potential gun purchasers and a ban on military-style assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, Republican lawmakers immediately rebuked the White House's efforts. Texas state lawmakers have already pushed proposals that would permit college students to carry weapons on campus and that would also open the door for gun-carrying marshals at primary schools.
Attorney General Greg Abbott last week threatened Travis County and the City of Austin with a ''double-barreled'' lawsuit when they considered banning gun shows on public property, and Gov. Rick Perry has said the country's Democratic leadership is using the slaughter of innocent children as a political pawn.
''The piling on by the political left, and their cohorts in the media, to use the massacre of little children to advance a pre-existing political agenda that would not have saved those children, disgusts me personally,'' Mr. Perry said in a statement on Wednesday.
Other Texas Republicans dismissed the notion that it was time to re-evaluate what role the United States plays in the carnage in Mexico, where more than 70,000 people have been killed in cartel-related violence since former President Felipe Calderףn declared war on organized crime in December 2006.
A December 2012 report from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives showed that more than 68,160 of the approximately 99,700 weapons recovered in Mexico and submitted for tracing between 2007 and 2011 had originated in the United States.
But United States Representative Michael McCaul, Republican of Austin and the chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, said the data were misleading and that changing gun laws in the United States would not change gun behavior in Mexico.
''The fact is, guns are illegal to possess in Mexico,'' Mr. McCaul said, ''and that certainly hasn't had any effects on the drug cartels.''
He said he understood that the debate was fueled by emotion, which he said was inevitable after years of bloodshed in Mexico and the murder of 20 schoolchildren in Connecticut. But he also said the public was not aware that many of the weapons favored by cartels like the Zetas came from other countries and were often not traceable, which inevitably led to data that reflected poorly on the United States.
''We all feel for what happened recently with the shooting in a very emotional way, but the fact is a lot of their AK-47s, which is the Zetas' gun of choice, those are coming from China and Russia,'' Mr. McCaul said. ''We could make guns in the United States illegal altogether, and I don't think it's going to stop the drug cartels from getting weapons.''
Gun-control proponents who link the United States' gun laws to violence in Mexico have drawn attention to what they call the gun-show loophole, which allows many dealers to sell firearms without conducting background checks. Critics call it a significant flaw that allows weapons to fall into the wrong hands, and law enforcement officers say it has aided the illegal smuggling of weapons into Mexico.
Jerry Patterson -- the Republican land commissioner and a gun collector, who wrote the state's concealed-handgun law in 1995 when he served as a state senator -- drew attention last month when he suggested that he was open to changing the ways background checks were conducted at gun shows.
But Mr. Patterson is not changing his mind on gun rights. What he is actually calling for is a privacy measure, he said, which would allow a customer to get a background check at a gun show that was good for the duration of the event but would not leave evidence of the purchase.
Mr. Patterson said what gun owners feared was what they believed gun control proponents wanted: to record every conveyance of a firearm.
''The fear is that things like that lead to registration,'' Mr. Patterson said. ''Registration may not be unconstitutional, but confiscation certainly is, and you can't have confiscation without registration.''
In one of his first public statements after being appointed Mexico's ambassador to the United States, Eduardo Medina Mora, the former attorney general of Mexico, said the Connecticut shooting had presented officials in the United States with an opportunity to quell the illegal flow of weapons into his country.
And United States Representative Robert O'Rourke, Democrat of El Paso, said ignoring the smuggling of weapons across the border during the current gun control debate would be counterproductive to the United States' work under the Mיrida Initiative, a $1.4 billion aid package of equipment and training intended to help Mexico and Central America fight drug violence. He said better enforcement of existing American laws, the closing of gaping loopholes and the institution of waiting periods for the purchase of high-powered guns should be on the table.
''As part of a community that has seen more than 10,000 people murdered in the last five or six years, this is certainly a discussion worth having,'' Mr. O'Rourke said. ''El Paso and other communities that have a unique perspective on this, given the recent violence in Mexico, should certainly be part of the conversation.''
Mr. Patterson acknowledged there was a problem with weapons smuggling into Mexico. But he said the best solution to end the carnage there was outside his purview as a Texas official.
''It wouldn't be a U.S. law; it would be a Mexican law,'' he said. ''There is no right to bear arms in Mexico. I would put forth a law that would establish a Second Amendment to keep and bear arms for Mexican citizens.''

9:40 P.M. (TMC) MELANCHOLIA (2011) Justine (Kirsten Dunst, above), a young bride whose crippling depression sabotages her lavish wedding party and nascent marriage, and Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg), her dutiful sister, await the impact of a rogue planet that suddenly appears in the night sky and seems to be heading straight for Earth. Alexander Skarsgard portrays Justine's bewildered husband; Mr. Skarsgard's father, Stellan Skarsgard, plays her obnoxious boss; and Charlotte Rampling and John Hurt are her bitterly divorced parents. In this ''excursion from the sad to the sublime by way of the preposterous, the always controversial Danish director Lars von Trier offers his own, highly personal version of apocalypse: a celestial collision rendered in surprisingly lovely digital effects and accompanied by mighty blasts of Wagner,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. ''Mr. von Trier, inspired (if that's the word) to make this movie by his own experience of depression, gleefully turns a psychological drama inside out. The world, Justine declares in her darkest moment of clarity, deserves its awful fate. The perverse achievement of 'Melancholia' is how difficult it is to argue with her conclusion.'' Ms. Dunst won best actress at the Cannes Film Festival, and Mr. von Trier was nominated for the Palme d'Or. 
6 A.M. (IFC) CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER (2006) A cruel emperor (Chow Yun-Fat) and his secretive wife (Gong Li, below) plot each other's annihilation: he by destroying her sanity with a rare fungus, she by planning a bloody coup during a festival. Writing in The Times, Jeannette Catsoulis said that this martial-arts drama from the director Zhang Yimou, set in A.D. 928, ''achieves a kind of operatic delirium, opening the floodgates of image and melodrama until the line between tragedy and black comedy is all but erased.''
9:25 A.M. (HBO Signature) GREENBERG (2010) In this film, directed by Noah Baumbach, Ben Stiller stars as Roger Greenberg, a 40-year-old former musician who, after a mental breakdown, house-sits in the large Los Angeles home of his vacationing brother. Greta Gerwig is Florence Marr, the brother's 25-year-old assistant and Roger's on-again, off-again love interest in his quest to recapture his youth. ''Only at the end does Mr. Baumbach reveal that the film has been a romantic comedy all along,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The Times. ''And suddenly a movie about a man who is defiantly difficult to like becomes very hard not to love.''
10 A.M. (ABC) THIS WEEK David Plouffe, a senior adviser to President Obama, makes the rounds of the morning news programs as he discusses some of the issues the president is facing -- including the economy, gun control and balancing the federal budget -- as well as the approach to a second term. The actress Eva Longoria, a co-chairwoman of the Presidential Inauguration Committee, talks about the celebrations surrounding the event. Mr. Plouffe also appears on ''Fox News Sunday,'' at 10, where Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri will offer the Republican perspective on the president's coming term; and on ''Face the Nation,'' at 10:30 on CBS, where he appears alongside former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Dee Dee Myers, a former press secretary to President Bill Clinton and a Vanity Fair contributing editor.
10:30 A.M. (NBC) MEET THE PRESS Senators Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, and Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, debate the president's second term, the debt ceiling and gun control.
9 P.M. (Reelz) ENTRAPMENT (1999) Sean Connery portrays Robert MacDougal, an art connoisseur who has assembled his collection through unscrupulous means; Catherine Zeta-Jones is Virginia Baker, an insurance investigator who tries to catch him by persuading him to join her in a heist. Jon Amiel directed this caper, which sends the two to the top of the world's tallest building on New Year's Eve to try to steal billions from a Malaysian bank. ''The match between these two may sound unlikely,'' Janet Maslin wrote in The Times, ''but it works because it isn't forced, and because both actors are so mischievously game.''
9 P.M. (13, 49) DOWNTON ABBEY The Irish revolution arrives at the abbey, and so does the fight for women's suffrage. Meanwhile, a conspiracy keeps Anna (Joanne Froggatt) and John Bates (Brendan Coyle, above) apart.
9 P.M. (E!) KOURTNEY & KIM TAKE MIAMI In this two-night season premiere, Kourtney and Kim Kardashian return to Miami to overhaul their Dash store. Part 2 will be shown on Monday at 9. KATHRYN SHATTUCK

Action Star With Savoir-Faire and a Killer Kick

BYLINE: By ANDY WEBSTER

SECTION: Section AR; Column 0; Arts and Leisure Desk; Pg. 19

LENGTH: 1029 words

TO paraphrase Paul Simon, every generation sends an action hero up the box office charts, whether it was the swashbuckling Douglas Fairbanks in the silent era, the stoic John Wayne midcentury, the hip Steve McQueen in the 1960s and '70s, or the musclebound Sylvester Stallone in the '80s.
The turn of the millennium offered its own template in Jason Statham, whose evolution from minor screen thug to global action star has brought him to ''Parker,'' opening Jan. 25, in which he plays the title character, the celebrated career criminal dreamed up by the novelist Donald E. Westlake (writing as Richard Stark). The production has a seasoned director (Taylor Hackford) and supporting cast (Nick Nolte, Patti LuPone, Michael Chiklis), and a glamorous leading lady (Jennifer Lopez). Will it be the film that finally pushes Mr. Statham into a Hollywood tier above his usual shoot-'em-up ghetto? Certainly this actor, 45, possesses a charisma transcending the genre.
His debut was modest but promising. The British director Guy Ritchie (''Sherlock Holmes'') midwifed Mr. Statham's arrival, in ''Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,'' a beery, rambunctious 1998 free-for-all about British gamblers and hooligans. 
In the first shot an uncharacteristically effusive Mr. Statham (pronounced STAY-thim) hawks stolen jewelry on the street. It isn't entirely an act; Mr. Statham, born in Derbyshire, hustled goods with his father in Norfolk market stalls growing up. Minutes later, when his character, pursued by a constable, bounds over a traffic barrier, we see the agility of this actor, for years a member of the British national diving team. Later, in a frenetic binge-drinking montage, he executes a standing back flip. But Mr. Ritchie must have seen something in Mr. Statham besides acrobatics; a sympathetic dimension, perhaps, a humanity.
In 2000 Mr. Ritchie cast him as the central narrator of ''Snatch,'' another British ensemble caper, about diamonds, bookmakers and unlicensed boxing. But Mr. Statham was overshadowed by Brad Pitt and Benicio Del Toro, and the role sentenced him to a career as a screen criminal. Who else has titles like ''The Bank Job'' and ''The Italian Job'' on his rיsumי? There he is as a kidnapper in ''Cellular,'' a drug dealer in ''Turn It Up,'' a convict in ''Death Race.''
But in his breakthrough he was a very smooth criminal. In 2002 the French director-producer Luc Besson (''La Femme Nikita'') cast him as the dapper Frank Martin in ''The Transporter,'' an action picture that goes down like cool prosecco. Martin is a getaway driver and underworld deliveryman with principles; any deviation from ''the deal'' is anathema. Things get complicated when he breaks his code and falls for his cargo (Shu Qi), the daughter of a human trafficker.
''The Transporter'' capitalizes on gorgeous French Riviera locations, blithe humor, flashy cars and spectacular stunts. And then there is Mr. Statham, easily stepping into dazzling fight sequences choreographed by the director, the martial-arts veteran Cory Yuen. Steven Seagal may have aikido moves, but not Mr. Statham's elegance in a suit (before ''Lock, Stock'' he was a model), nor his compact grace and stubbled, close-cropped sex appeal. (It's no accident that Martin has a habit of doffing his shirt mid-brawl.) Not since Sean Connery had the action genre seen such Continental savoir-faire. Mr. Connery, however, couldn't execute a roundhouse kick.
But Mr. Statham the actor didn't take the genre too seriously. As Clint Eastwood did in ''City Heat,'' he sent up his persona in Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor's 2006 cult favorite ''Crank,'' a delirious exercise in comic macho excess, edited at blinding speed. ''Crank'' -- about a poisoned hit man forced to consume all manner of stimulants (cocaine, Red Bull, epinephrine) to keep his heart from giving out -- has Mr. Statham piloting a motorcycle in a hospital smock, copulating in front of a tourist bus and calling his girlfriend as he plummets from a helicopter. ''Crank 2: High Voltage'' takes the parody further: Mr. Statham bites into jumper cables and fights an opponent amid a shower of sparks at a power station, their slow-motion blows evoking combatants in Japanese monster movies.
''The Bank Job,'' from 2008, directed by Roger Donaldson and based on an actual 1971 London heist, returned Mr. Statham to firm ground, buoyed by a tight script, a strong cast (including Saffron Burrows and David Suchet) and a role tailor-made for him. As Terry Leather, the leader of a hapless gang, he plays a loyal but flawed husband trying to improve his family's lot but in over his head with a pornographer, loan sharks and the royal family.
Mr. Statham is at his best here: shrewd, tough, compassionate, appealing without a fancy car or a gun. In his plain-spoken bearing he exudes an integrity devoid of upper-crust pretensions. His performance is winning because it feels authentic, and it feels authentic because in the case of Mr. Statham, a working-class high school dropout, it is.
But acting requires more than authenticity. In 2006 Mr. Statham stretched a little, with ''London,'' a little-seen character study about victims of love at a loft party, featuring his ''Cellular'' co-stars Jessica Biel and Chris Evans. Mr. Statham, as a commodities dealer with a secret, at one point offers a rare display of vulnerability.
It's a worthy effort, but not enough. After all, an action star like Steve McQueen had his dramas (''The Cincinnati Kid'') and romances (''Love With a Proper Stranger''), playing not only men of action but men of complexity and inner conflict. Mr. Statham needs to do the same. Lately he has done only cursory movies -- ''Killer Elite,'' ''Safe,'' ''The Mechanic'' -- and the ''Expendables'' films, orgies of gunplay, explosions and wrinkled pugilists.
It remains to be seen whether ''Parker'' can raise Mr. Statham's standing. His next movie, though, finds him in good company: ''Hummingbird'' is a drama written and directed by Steven Knight (''Dirty Pretty Things''), in which Mr. Statham plays a haunted veteran who assumes a wealthy Londoner's identity. Trust him to put up a good fight; he's pretty skilled at that.

Good and Evil in Birmingham

BYLINE: By DIANE McWHORTER. 
Diane McWhorter is the author of ''Carry Me Home.''

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; OP-ED CONTRIBUTOR; Pg. 21

LENGTH: 985 words

FIFTY years ago, Birmingham, Ala., provided the enduring iconography of the civil rights era, testing the mettle of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. so dramatically that he was awarded the 1964 Nobel Peace Prize.
During his protest there in May 1963, the biblical spectacle of black children facing down Public Safety Commissioner Eugene (Bull) Connor's fire hoses and police dogs set the stage for King's Sermon on the Mount some four months later at the Lincoln Memorial. And the civil rights movement's ''Year of Birmingham'' passed into history as an epic narrative of good versus evil.
Our understanding of the ''good'' has expanded beyond the lone-dreamer theory to embrace other activists, like King's partner in Birmingham, the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth. Yet the evil segregationist archetype is fixed in the popular mind as the villainous housewife of ''The Help'' or the cretinous mob of ''Django Unchained'' -- nobody we'd ever know, or certainly ever be. 
But the disquieting reality is that the conflict was between not good and evil, but good and normal. The brute racism that today seems like mass social insanity was a ''way of life'' practiced by ordinary ''good'' people.
According to the Southern community's consensus of ''normal,'' those fighting for rights now considered mainstream were ''extremists,'' and public servants could rationalize plans to murder men like Shuttlesworth, confident that they were on the right side of history.
Consider new evidence about a plan by Connor to have Shuttlesworth assassinated. Under Connor's orders, Detective Tom Cook found a black man vulnerable to the law, supplied him with a gun and planted him by the steps of a church where Shuttlesworth was speaking one night. The plot was foiled when a passing police car frightened the hit man away.
What distinguishes this from other officially sanctioned schemes to kill Shuttlesworth is proof that it was known by the state's largest news organization, The Birmingham News, owned by the Newhouse family, which also sponsored extensive surveillance of local citizens.
Cook described the attempt to a young reporter at The News, Tom Lankford, who was considered ''Bull's boy'' by the police he covered. He was also the protיgי of the paper's chief executive, Vincent Townsend, who had given him a sizable budget for surveillance equipment to fulfill his own desire, as the city's power broker, ''to know every word they're saying,'' according to Mr. Lankford, ''10 minutes after they've said it.''
Logically, then, Townsend was also aware that the city commissioner he had supported editorially intended to murder an innocent, nonviolent man. But The News remained silent on Connor's criminal proclivities, and the lawman who had no qualms about telling a reporter of his key role in an attempted murder must not have realized he was doing anything wrong.
Mr. Lankford saw Townsend's goal as ''racial peace in troubled Birmingham,'' and believed that it was being served by the surveillance he conducted in frequent concert with the police. Indeed their mission was aided by a previously undisclosed communitywide network.
The phone company gave Mr. Lankford and his law-enforcement cohorts spiked pole climbers and instructions on ''running'' various junction boxes, and lent them an old truck still bearing the Southern Bell logo.
A local rabbi -- one of the eight clergymen to whom King addressed his ''Letter From Birmingham Jail'' -- purchased spy equipment for the police, intending for it to be used on racist groups under investigation for placing dynamite at a local temple in 1958.
But the electronics also ended up being used on white community leaders and, naturally, the civil rights movement. Mr. Lankford says he and a police detective even eavesdropped on union officials representing Newhouse's broadcast employees during contract negotiations. One popular wiretap target was a local pastor, A. D. King, who was overheard arranging a rendezvous for him and his visiting older brother, Martin Luther King, with women who were not their wives. The police organized a sting, with Mr. Lankford along to take pictures. We may never know if the intelligence on the brothers was correct, because the detectives lost the car carrying the elder King that night in a traffic jam.
But the most surprising detail about this incident is that it happened in October 1963, months after Connor was forced from office. That means that the new, supposedly enlightened city government was carrying on his battle to destroy the movement that had just irrevocably put Birmingham on the map, next to Gettysburg: those ''events of Birmingham'' had moved John F. Kennedy to introduce what became the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
As its yearlong commemoration of those events now begins, white Birmingham will be tempted to fall back on its favorite ''Bull Connor as bad apple'' defense. Even for those who lived through segregation, it's hard to accept the civic truth of Shuttlesworth's time: that ''racial peace'' was an objective supported by murder.
''Everyone behaves badly -- given the chance,'' Hemingway wrote in ''The Sun Also Rises.'' What sets white Southerners apart is that they had so many ways to go wrong, confronting a moral dilemma each time they drank from a white water fountain. Painting all segregationists as cartoon racists encourages the rest of us to take cover under a blanket illusion of blamelessness -- give or take an Abu Ghraib or a Penn State football program. Or the F.B.I.'s own obscene wiretap campaign to discredit Martin Luther King.
If I were to indulge in the annual ''If King were alive ...'' game, I would guess he'd be morally embarrassing the insidious new ''normal'' -- assassination by drone, for example, and the repressed torture ''debate'' that has returned on such a timely holiday. Do we really want to be a country that argues about whether torture ''works''? So did segregation.

Gun-Control Advocate Says She Is Looking For a Million Good Moms

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; CITY ROOM; Pg. 19

LENGTH: 671 words

Shannon Watts of Zionsville, Ind., did not want her 12-year-old son to hear about the Sandy Hook massacre. The memory of what had happened last summer after the movie theater shootings in Aurora, Colo., was too raw.
The day after the Colorado shootings, her son Sam went to see "The Dark Knight Rises," the same Batman movie that had been playing when James E. Holmes opened fire, killing 12 people and wounding 58 others. Sam had what Ms. Watts described as a panic attack. 
"He became obsessed with the idea that the person next to him had a gun," she said, adding that he was soon afflicted with nervous tics and had a hard time sleeping. He has since seen a psychologist, she said.
Ms. Watts's first response to word of the carnage at the elementary school in Newtown, Conn., was: "We can't let Sam know." Her second response was to start a grass-roots group, One Million Moms for Gun Control, to press for more effective firearms legislation and for what she called "a sensible interpretation of the Second Amendment."
The group, working with newly formed chapters from Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens, plans to gather at 9:15 a.m. on Monday at Cadman Plaza Park in Brooklyn, march across the Brooklyn Bridge at 9:35 a.m. and hold a rally in City Hall Park at 10:30 a.m. Ms. Watts will speak, as will Jackie Rowe-Adams, a founder of Harlem Mothers SAVE, which assists parents whose children have been killed by gun violence.
"The time has come, just like in the 1980s when the time was right for Mothers Against Drunk Driving," Ms. Watts said. "We need MADD for gun control."
Ms. Watts, who said she was a corporate public-relations executive for 15 years and has been "a stay-at-home mom" for the last five, started the group with a Facebook page. By Saturday, more than 31,600 Facebook users had "liked" the group.
"There was no focus group testing," she said. "I came up with the name off the top of my head. I had a feeling that every other mom in America had a similar idea. I just happened to create the page that they found."
Since then, she said, the group has applied to the Internal Revenue Service for nonprofit tax status and has set up more than 70 chapters. But she said she was determined to use social media to counter the influence of the National Rifle Association and its success in lobbying to loosen or eliminate gun regulations.
"We had a whole tool created so moms can get online and e-mail and tweet their representatives, 'We demand action now,'" she said. "We see this as very much a long-term effort on the state and federal levels to create stronger gun control laws that will protect our families."
The group issued a statement on Wednesday applauding President Obama's proposals to ban military-style assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines and to widen background checks for gun buyers. The One Million Moms group also called for regulating and tracking ammunition and for limiting state concealed-weapons laws.
Ms. Watts, in a telephone interview, praised the gun control bill that the New York Legislature approved and that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo signed into law on Tuesday. The measure expanded the existing ban on assault weapons and limited magazine clips to 7 rounds of ammunition instead of 10.
She suggested that New York's success in passing a gun-control bill should serve as an example for Congress. "The fact that Governor Cuomo was able to find common sense and common ground with a Republican-led State Senate shows it can be done," she said.
She said the Sandy Hook shootings were "the tipping point" in the national dialogue on gun violence.
"When you see 6- and 7-year-old babies shot 11 times in a classroom, a place we consider a safe haven, that's a tipping point," she said. "The N.R.A. outlined how they saw the vision of America. That future is everyone is armed and the bad guys shoot it out with the good guys over our children's heads. That's not tenable, and it's not the American way."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

5 Hurt at 3 Gun Shows

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

LENGTH: 118 words

MEDINA, Ohio (AP) -- Accidental shootings at gun shows in three states left five people wounded over the weekend. 
At a show in Raleigh, N.C., a 12-gauge shotgun went off on Saturday as its owner unzipped its case at a security checkpoint. Two people were hit by shotgun pellets and were hospitalized. A retired deputy sheriff also suffered a slight hand injury.
In Indianapolis, the police said a 54-year-old man was wounded when he inadvertently shot himself in the hand while leaving a gun show.
In Ohio, a gun dealer in Medina was examining a semiautomatic handgun he bought on Saturday when he accidentally pulled the trigger and a bullet ricocheted off the floor and struck his friend in the arm and the leg.

For Obama, Context for His 2nd Term

BYLINE: By ALBERT R. HUNT | BLOOMBERG NEWS

SECTION: Section ; Column 0; Foreign Desk; LETTER FROM WASHINGTON; Pg. 

LENGTH: 881 words

WASHINGTON -- Here are two realities about U.S. second presidential terms: They aren't cursed, as legend has it, and they are rarely better than first ones.
On Sunday, Barack Obama was to become the 17th U.S. president to be inaugurated for a second time, and historians offer useful context. ''Obama has read the literature and understands overreach,'' said Michael Beschloss, one of the more than half a dozen scholars who recently had dinner with the president. ''This puts him one step ahead of most'' re-elected presidents.
That sentiment contrasts with the mood of many Democrats these days. In conversations with a dozen Democratic politicians, with a few exceptions, there is a pervasive pessimism about the next several years. Almost all requested anonymity, not out of fear, they say, but to avoid giving solace to Republicans. 
The political environment, they say, is as poisonous as it ever was.
The fiscal struggles won't be settled in the next few months; more likely they'll be prolonged through the year, crowding out most other issues, with the possible exception of immigration and conceivably gun violence legislation.
The president shows few signs of reaching out or broadening his horizon. If anything, Capitol Hill Democrats say, the inner circle is more closed. Mr. Obama, most recently at a news conference last week, deprecates the role of relationships in politics; he's dismissive of the notion that all would be better if he would just drink whiskey with lawmakers, as Lyndon B. Johnson did. He's right. Few will shift policy positions because of a good Scotch or bourbon. Yet his critics also are right when they point out that every successful president has forged crucial political relationships.
Some conditions are beyond a president's control to influence. Saturation news coverage takes more of a toll in a second term. ''One of the greatest threats to the modern presidency is overexposure,'' said the historian Richard Norton Smith. ''There will be Obama fatigue.''
Then there's the supposed second-term curse: Johnson and the Vietnam War; Richard M. Nixon and Watergate; Bill Clinton and impeachment; George W. Bush and Hurricane Katrina.
Robert W. Merry, who has written about how presidents are evaluated, suggested ''it's almost impossible to find a president who had a second term better than his first.''
Presidents usually win re-election because they had a reasonably successful first term; that, some experts point out, distorts any comparisons, a state of affairs that became apparent with one of the earliest U.S. presidential re-elections: that of Thomas Jefferson in 1804.
''You can't buy Louisiana every term,'' Mr. Norton-Smith said. ''That doesn't mean there can't be accomplishments.''
Ronald Reagan, in his second term, won sweeping tax changes and a historical arms-reduction treaty with the Soviet Union. Even some administrations known for conspicuous failings look better with perspective.
Franklin D. Roosevelt botched the economic recovery and tried to pack the Supreme Court in the late 1930s. He also, subtly, prepared the United States for World War II, a bigger achievement. Dwight D. Eisenhower's party was clobbered in congressional elections, and he was embarrassed when a spy plane was shot down over the Soviet Union. He also sent U.S. troops to integrate the schools in Little Rock, Arkansas, a seminal moment. Mr. Clinton's second term produced few tangible achievements, though he continued to reposition the Democratic Party.
Today, the second-term optimists among Democrats say the president is contending with a much stronger and stable economy than the one he inherited four years ago. They see a more self-assured chief executive. One outside operative contrasts a session he had with Mr. Obama four years ago with one a few weeks ago, saying the president is a different man, more confident, clearer on what he wants to do.
Mr. Obama no longer harbors illusions, these Democrats say, about Republican congressional leaders. He's willing, even eager, for combat. Republicans, whose standing with the public continues its free fall, are one of Mr. Obama's greatest assets.
Whatever the political limitations, historians say Mr. Obama needs to think big, starting with his second Inaugural Address.
''He has a chance to explain where America ought to be in 10 or 20 years,'' said H.W. Brands of the University of Texas at Austin, who also attended the scholars' dinner with the president. ''He can rise above everyday politics and speak to history. Lincoln did it in 1865; F.D.R. in 1937. Now it's Obama's chance.''
Some Democrats say the president would be able to make a more compelling case if his inner circle weren't so insular. The Team of Rivals of the early first term, when the president brought in diverse voices, has turned into the Band of Brothers, with a premium on personal loyalty. Top White House aides have let it be known that they will be making more personnel and policy decisions in the economics and foreign affairs arenas.
And while Mr. Obama may appreciate the dangers of second-term overreach, he's quick to claim a mandate on issues, an assertion with a dubious historical resonance.
''Presidents should erase the word 'mandate' from their vocabulary,'' Mr. Norton Smith said. ''At best, it's treacherous.''

1913 Marconi Dissolves Contract
LONDON -- There was a surprise at the Marconi select committee of the House of Commons yesterday [Jan. 20], when the chairman reported that the Postmaster-General had forwarded to him from the Marconi Company a letter in which it requested the Government to treat the contract as no longer binding on either party. The letter -- a long one -- was signed by Mr. Godfrey Isaacs, and referred to the contract of July 19, 1912, between the Post Office and Marconi's Wireless Telegraph Company (Limited) and Mr. Guglielmo Marconi. The attention of the Government was called to the serious loss and inconvenience to the company through the work under the agreement not being proceeded with. 
1938 Royal Wedding in Egypt
CAIRO -- In a curious Moslem ceremony lasting only a few minutes, Farida Zulficar became the wife of King Farouk of Egypt this morning [Jan. 17]. Both are seventeen years old. It was the first royal wedding in Egypt since the days of the Pharaohs. Tonight, while the city was aglitter with colored lights and noisy with merrymaking, the young Queen cut a wedding cake nineteen feet high with her husband's bejeweled sword. At midnight, she was led by Farouk to the throne. The Nile was a fairyland spectacle, with water fetes, thousands of colored lights, and Oriental music.
1963 Paintings Found in Caracas
CARACAS, Venezuela -- Police recovered five stolen French paintings worth $660.000 here last night [Jan. 19] following a gun battle with three persons in a car. The paintings, on loan from the Louvre and the Museum of Modem Art in Paris, were stolen by terrorists last week from an exhibition here entitled ''100 Years of French Painting.'' Interior Minister Carlos Andres Perez said the paintings -- still-lifes by Picasso, Braque and Gaughin, Van Gogh's ''Lilies in a Copper Vase'' and Cezanne's ''Bathers'' -- were ''intact.'' But police said that the Van Gogh, the Cezanne and the Picasso had been slightly scratched.

Obama Takes Oath, Beginning 2nd Term: An Intimate White House Ceremony -- Traditional Pomp Is Set for Today

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES; Sheryl Gay Stolberg contributed reporting.

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 1

WASHINGTON -- With only his family beside him, Barack Hussein Obama was sworn into office for a second term on Sunday in advance of Monday's public pomp, facing a bitterly divided government at home and persistent threats abroad that inhibit his effort to redefine America's use of power.
It was a brief and intimate moment in the White House, held because of a quirk of the calendar that placed the constitutionally mandated start of the new term on a Sunday.
But the low-key event seemed to capture tempered expectations after four years of economic troubles and near-constant partisan confrontation. And it presaged a formal inauguration on Monday that will be less of a spectacle than the first one, when the nation's first black president embodied hope and change for many Americans at a time of financial struggle and war. 
For Monday's festivities, with the traditional parade, balls and not least the re-enacted swearing-in outside the Capitol, there will be fewer parties and fewer people swarming the National Mall; organizers expect less than half the 1.8 million people who flocked to the city last time.
Once the parties end, Mr. Obama's second-term challenges are formidable, not least given his ambitious priorities of addressing the national debt, illegal immigration and gun violence.
The economy, while recovering steadily, remains fragile. The unemployment rate is as high as it was in January 2009, though it is down from the 10 percent peak reached late that year, and there is no consensus with Republicans about additional stimulus measures -- or virtually anything else.
And as the terrorist attack in Algeria last week illustrated, Mr. Obama continues to confront threats around the globe, both from state actors like Iran and North Korea and from Qaeda-inspired extremists seeking to exploit power vacuums in the Mideast and across Africa and Asia.
At home, the emphasis is on reducing the deficits that piled up because of the economic downturn and the soaring costs of caring for an aging population. Yet Mr. Obama and Republicans in Congress, divided by opposing views on the role of government, are no closer to a budget agreement that would overhaul taxes and costly, fast-growing entitlement programs like Medicare. The next showdown in what has seemed a never-ending loop of fiscal brinkmanship and half-measures is likely to come as soon as next month over spending cuts.
The persistent partisan battles underscore Mr. Obama's inability to make good on an original promise -- that he would open a bipartisan era of problem solving. While Mr. Obama's words have become less soaring and more confrontational toward Republicans after four years in which they sought to foil him, David Plouffe, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama, said on the CNN program ''State of the Union'' on Sunday that the president had written a ''hopeful'' inaugural address for Monday's ceremony.
But Senator John Barrasso, Republican of Wyoming, said on the same program, ''The president seems so fixated on demonizing Republicans that he is blinded to the opportunities as well as the obligations that he has to deal with the big problems of this country on debt and the entitlements.''
Mr. Obama draws approval from just over half of Americans -- down 11 percentage points from his popularity in a New York Times/CBS News survey just after his first inauguration -- with Republicans united in opposition and independents split. If history is a guide, he has a limited time to act before his post-election leverage fades.
The official swearing-in of Mr. Obama, 51, was just the seventh time in history that a president was sworn in privately before the public ceremony, and the first since President Ronald Reagan's second inauguration. Each instance since 1821 occurred because the constitutionally mandated date for the inauguration fell on a Sunday.
The simplicity of Mr. Obama's minute-long taking of the oath of office suggested a marriage before a justice of the peace, with a big ceremony and party planned for later.
Only Michelle Obama, holding her family Bible for the ceremony, and the Obamas's daughters, Malia and Sasha, stood beside Mr. Obama in the grand Blue Room as he recited the 35-word oath in the Constitution that was administered, as it was four years ago, by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. About a dozen relatives of the Obamas and Jane Roberts, the justice's wife, watched out of camera range.
By contrast, the swearing-in hours earlier of Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. at the vice-presidential mansion, while simple, was large enough to suggest that Mr. Biden is indeed looking beyond the next four years to the 2016 election. Among the 120 guests who watched Justice Sonia M. Sotomayor swear in Mr. Biden were Democratic dignitaries from the early presidential-nominating states, including Gov. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire. On Saturday evening, Mr. Biden attended a party of Democrats from Iowa, the first presidential caucus state.
The private ceremonies were held because, under the Constitution, the two men's first terms ended at noon on Sunday. In between their events, Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden went together to Arlington National Cemetery to lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns. And they prayed, separately: the Obamas attended services at the 175-year-old Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church, where the enthusiastic congregation engaged in a call-and-response with the pastor evoking the president's ''Forward'' campaign slogan; the Bidens and their guests celebrated a Mass in the vice-presidential mansion.
In the evening, Mr. Obama, Mr. Biden and their wives attended a gala for donors to both the 2012 campaign and the inaugural expenses, where performers included Stevie Wonder.
For Mr. Obama, the solemnity of his swearing-in was broken by his younger daughter, Sasha, who seemed to recall the problem four years earlier, when a garbling of the oath by both her father and Chief Justice Roberts at the Capitol forced them to repeat the oath at the White House the next day.
With warmth that belied their political differences, especially over campaign spending law, Justice Roberts congratulated Mr. Obama, and the president thanked him twice as they shook hands. Mr. Obama then embraced his wife and daughters in turn. ''Good job, Daddy,'' Sasha said. ''I did it!'' he replied, only to have her quip, ''You didn't mess up'' -- leaving the president chuckling and rolling his eyes as he pivoted to thank the small group of witnesses and exit the room.
Elsewhere on a sunny winter Sunday, the streets of Washington were snarled with traffic, and hotels and homes were filling with the tens of thousands of visitors who, along with area residents, began partying through the weekend in bars and at receptions hosted by corporations and political groups.
Democratic women especially were feted. At a party sponsored by Emily's List, which helps elect Democratic women who favor abortion rights, the talk was of 2016 -- and whether Hillary Rodham Clinton, the departing secretary of state, might run for president.
Flags, bunting and red, white and blue lights festooned streets, buildings and grounds, but as usual for such events, also ubiquitous were cement and metal security barriers, along with police and troops on downtown blocks.
Much is changed since January 2009, and much of it not in the way Mr. Obama planned. His challenges ahead are perhaps not so great as then -- 779,000 people lost their jobs that January, a one-month record, the financial and auto industries were teetering and millions of Americans were losing homes and savings -- but they are nonetheless daunting.
While Democrats controlled Congress for his first two years, when Mr. Obama passed his signature laws for economic stimulus, expanded health insurance and financial industry regulation, Republicans captured the House majority in a conservative backlash at his midterm and are expected to keep it for his second term, given their success in drawing districts to keep them safe for Republicans. That means Mr. Obama's other priorities for a second term -- chiefly addressing illegal immigration and gun violence -- likewise will hardly come easy, if at all.

Insurgents Attack Kabul Traffic Police

Five insurgents attacked the headquarters of the Kabul traffic police early Monday morning, setting off a huge explosion near the entrance to the compound and storming the building. 
Two insurgents were shot during an initial gun battle before 6 a.m., the police said, and at least one traffic police officer was killed. Another traffic officer wounded in the firefight managed to call for help from his cellphone, according to a police official.
Explosions and gunfire continued to ring out from the compound, where a battery of Afghan security forces assembled to defend the lightly armed traffic police. From the street, police officers could be seen firing on insurgents from the rooftop of the facility's main building.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, the second one it has carried out in less than a week.
''Our target was a special police training unit where foreign instructors and trainers train,'' said a Taliban spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahid. ''We inflicted heavy casualties to the enemy so far and that is a part of our routine operations against the enemy.''
On Wednesday, heavily armed bombers blew up the gate to an Afghan intelligence facility, killing at least one security agent and injuring numerous civilians. The consecutive attacks have rattled the relative security Kabul has experienced compared with other areas of the country.

Private Pain and Public Debate Take Toll on Newtown Parents

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME and ELIZABETH MAKER

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 1173 words

NEWTOWN, Conn. -- Jimmy Greene and Nelba Mבrquez-Greene have not turned on a television or read a newspaper since their 6-year-old daughter, Ana, a blur of joyful energy who loved singing, dancing, floral headbands and the Bible, died more than a month ago.
They listen to gospel music constantly, while what they call a Peace Posse of relatives and friends helps them with cooking and chores and prays on their behalf.
Ana Mבrquez-Greene was one of 26 children and educators murdered by a gunman at Sandy Hook Elementary School here on Dec. 14. And for the Mבrquez-Greenes and other families of the Sandy Hook victims, the horror of the crime and the media glare that followed have meant they must confront intimate personal grief in the midst of a heated debate about guns. 
The families find themselves caught between private healing and public participation, between the need to take care of themselves and the pull of voices demanding that the tragedy produce public change. The competing pressures can be overwhelming.
Members of about 11 families came forward as part of a local organization formed in response to the shootings, and four families attended President Obama's speech last week unveiling his gun-control initiatives.
''We're not in post-traumatic stress; we're in trauma, right now,'' said Mrs. Marquez-Greene, a marriage and family therapist. ''We've chosen not to make hard and fast decisions about anything. Some days I want to get up and go outside and get the groceries, and some days I can't brush my teeth. Some days I feel I can be a good parent to my son, and some days I just want to stay in bed and sleep.''
Most pointed, the families find themselves struggling with whether and how to participate in the public debate over guns and violence. At Mr. Obama's news conference on Wednesday, he made special mention of Grace McDonnell, killed at Sandy Hook, whose parents were in attendance. One of her paintings, given to Mr. Obama by her father, Chris, now hangs in the president's private study off the Oval Office.
''We have to make something positive come of this, and I feel a need to advocate for change right away,'' said Alexis Haller, an uncle of Noah Pozner, another of the children who were killed. Mr. Haller, a lawyer in Washington State, attended Mr. Obama's speech and had earlier sent the White House a memorandum on gun and school safety issues.
''To me,'' Mr. Haller said, ''this is now a lifelong mission, to make children safer and to stop mass shootings.''
But in a fairly conservative, highly religious suburban community where guns are common, many people are not psychologically ready to jump into the fray, not sure what their position should be, or not convinced that the existing political template is the way to move forward.
The Mבrquez-Greenes have been drawn to the fledgling local group Sandy Hook Promise, which says it is committed to producing lasting change but has advocated conversation and recognition of common ground, rather than a defined agenda.
The group, in a statement, said it welcomed the ''broad focus of the president's proposals,'' appreciated his actions through executive orders and applauded his ''broader commitment to finding meaningful, common-sense solutions to help prevent similar acts of violence.''
''What we desire and deeply pray for is real change,'' Mr. Greene said, ''and we stand alongside the folks who organized Sandy Hook Promise, who say real change doesn't happen when we immediately take sides and get ready to fight the other side. Real change happens when we come together on issues that are not political but that are, above all, human issues that affect us all as human beings.''
Each family is finding its own ways to cope and to honor the victims. Most have set up Facebook pages, Web sites or memorial funds honoring their children. But even that can be a source of dissonance -- several of the pages have become magnets for extremists hawking the bizarre theory that the killings in Newtown were a hoax intended to advance the cause of gun control. Some family members have been taken aback at the vitriolic response to their engagement on gun issues.
Mark Barden is still trying to make sense of the day when his 7-year-old son, Daniel, for unknown reasons, rose almost two hours early and ran down the driveway in his pajamas and flip-flops to give his older brother a hug and kiss goodbye as he waited for his school bus.
Daniel then stayed up to watch the sunrise through his window, played a game of foosball and the piano with his father before he left for Sandy Hook Elementary on Dec. 14.
''I can't admit, I can't comprehend that he's gone forever,'' said Mr. Barden, who, like Mr. Greene, is a musician.
The family is seeing a psychotherapist and, like many others, finding support through its church and the astounding outreach within the community, which includes people cooking meals, shoveling driveways, running errands.
''I have never owned guns, and I don't feel educated enough about gun culture to take a position on it,'' Mr. Barden said. ''And I'm not prepared to speak about mental illness. What I can do is talk about family values. Our children never went to day care. My wife and I could have worked extra jobs, but we agreed it was more important for us to get by with less money, but be able to raise our children with consistent love and kindness.''
So he has been drawn to Sandy Hook Promise, and he has created a Facebook page called W.W.D.D. -- What Would Daniel Do. The page is full of photos, stories and videos of Daniel, ''intended to inspire goodness; to inspire people to do random acts of kindness,'' Mr. Barden said.
Dr. John Woodall, a local psychiatrist who has done trauma counseling in war zones and disaster areas across the world, said that what the families wanted most was to find ways to honor the victims. But to enter the public debate is to invite opposition and rancor. And, he said, many are just not psychologically ready for that.
''You can't pull a butterfly out of its cocoon; it has to be its time,'' Dr. Woodall said. ''The nation has an important debate, but these people have much more intimate work to do, and whether they are ready to participate in that debate is a very intimate and personal thing.''
Some worry that with the short attention span of the American public, failing to act on guns now risks missing a pivotal political window that will not remain open indefinitely.
Still, both those who have joined with Sandy Hook Promise and those who have not agree that each family will have to find its own path, and that path over time could include private grief, public activism and a continuing need to come to terms with what still seems unimaginable.
Ms. Mבrquez-Greene recalled that one day when she was a bit anxious, Ana turned to her and said, ''Don't let them suck your fun circuits dry, Mom.''
''This grief process is personal, it's long and it's complex, and it's different for every one of us,'' she said.
She added, ''But we're not going to let this suck our fun circuits dry.''

Prison Is Not as Mandatory As the State's Gun Laws Say

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 18

LENGTH: 1010 words

The last time New York State's gun laws were tightened, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg rolled out a graphic reminder of what would happen to anyone caught carrying a loaded, illegal weapon.
''Guns = Prison,'' public service posters proclaimed categorically. In 2006, the mandatory prison sentence was increased to 3.5 years from 1 year.
Five years later, though, that equation seemed decidedly more equivocal. In 2011, the latest year for which sentencing statistics are available, fewer than half the defendants who had been arrested for illegal possession of a loaded gun in New York City received a state prison sentence, according to an analysis of criminal justice statistics by the mayor's office. 
In the Bronx, as few as 31 percent were imprisoned. In Brooklyn the rate was 41 percent; in Staten Island it was 47 percent; in Manhattan it was 68 percent; and in Queens it was 76 percent.
Still, the proportion of defendants sentenced to prison represents an improvement over previous years, said John Feinblatt, the mayor's chief policy adviser and criminal justice coordinator. ''Before the new law in 2006, which required anyone convicted of felony possession of an unlicensed loaded gun to serve three and a half years, the prison rate was 28 percent,'' he said. ''We've made a lot of progress.''
But the fact that only half the suspects arrested wind up in state prison also demonstrates that the prerogatives of prosecutors and judges still create a lot of wiggle room, particularly in cases that are weaker or have mitigating circumstances.
Mr. Feinblatt said the laws had what he called a ''gigantic loophole'': prison sentences are mandatory except where the interests of justice would dictate otherwise. ''You could drive a Mack truck through that,'' he said.
Sometimes, he said, prosecutors reduce the charges appropriately as a result of plea bargaining, which spares the time and expense of going to trial in a marginal case, as when a weapon is found in a car carrying several people and it is difficult to prove who had physical possession, or the seizure is subject to constitutional challenges over its reasonableness.
In pressing for a stricter assault weapons ban last month, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said the law had ''more holes than Swiss cheese.''
Even some of the more stringent assault weapons provisions rushed through the Legislature last week, while raising minimum penalties, have left some prosecutors puzzled. For example, the new law says those penalties ''shall'' be imposed, not ''must be.''
The law also leaves some latitude if a judge, ''having regard to the nature and circumstances of the crime and to the history and character of the defendant,'' finds that meting out consecutive sentences for multiple offenses ''would be unduly harsh and that not imposing such sentence would be consistent with the public safety and would not deprecate the seriousness of the crime.''
Richard A. Brown, the district attorney in Queens, has taken the word ''mandatory'' more literally.
''The statistics bear out the effectiveness of the supply-and-demand strategy that we have been following for some time here in Queens,'' he said. ''On the one hand, we aggressively go after the gun supply by going after those who traffic in illegal weapons, and on the other hand we concentrate on controlling the demand for illegal guns by making it clear that if you illegally possess a gun in Queens County, there is a very strong likelihood that you are going to state prison.''
Robert J. Masters, the executive assistant district attorney in Queens, said prosecutors sought to change the culture on the street and in the courthouse.
''We wanted to make sure that people understood that prison was the presumptive sentence for carrying a gun,'' he said. ''We also wanted the legal community to appreciate that if we deviated from that position, it would be rare and based on prison being truly 'unduly harsh' rather than being merely unduly inconvenient.''
The ratio of arrests to prison sentences is only one measure of the law's effectiveness. By another measure, of the 448 defendants sentenced in New York State in 2011 after conviction on the top illegal gun possession charge, 437 received a term of at least three and a half years.
That same year, 3,018 people were arrested on that charge in the state. State Division of Criminal Justice Services officials caution that comparisons between arrests and convictions can be imprecise because not all the cases are adjudicated in one calendar year.
Steven Reed, spokesman for the Bronx district attorney, said the comparison of arrests and prison sentences of three and a half years also did not account for the number of shorter prison sentences imposed after guilty pleas, or after the many convictions in the cases that prosecutors chose to try. ''When those numbers are included, the incarceration rate for gun cases in the Bronx is nearly 85 percent,'' he said. (In Queens that rate is 98 percent.)
An illegal gun is one for which someone does not have a valid New York State permit, which means that the law can sometimes trap travelers who bring licensed guns into the state. Critics of strict mandatory sentencing caution that allowances must be made for unwitting violations.
''What happens is you caught up so many people who are really innocent, honest gun owners who make stupid technical mistakes,'' said Peter H. Tilem, a Westchester lawyer who specializes in weapons possession cases.
Mr. Reed said that in 2011, Bronx prosecutors did not seek the mandatory minimum in cases involving a state prison guard who was not authorized to carry a firearm only because he had failed to submit the required paperwork, and a Pennsylvania school bus driver who was traveling to his sister-in-law's wake in New York.
Still, Mr. Feinblatt, the mayor's criminal justice coordinator, suggested that the 50 percent mandatory minimum imprisonment rate remained too low. ''Maybe I can't answer what should it be,'' he said, ''but when I look and see that one borough is doing 76 percent, I certainly see what it can be.''

Texas Attorney General to New Yorkers: Come on Down, With Guns

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ

AUSTIN, Tex. -- Attention New Yorkers: Texas wants you. And your guns.
Last week, the day after Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York approved a broad package of gun-control measures that made New York's tough gun laws even tougher, the Texas attorney general, Greg Abbott, began running Internet advertisements in Manhattan and Albany asking New York gun owners to consider moving to Texas.
The two ads -- displayed on news sites and aimed at Web users with Manhattan and Albany ZIP codes -- promote the state's low taxes and gun culture, with one asking, ''Is Gov. Cuomo looking to take your guns?'' The other reads, ''Wanted: Law abiding New York gun owners looking for lower taxes and greater opportunity.'' 
When clicked on, the ads lead users to a Facebook page where a letter from Mr. Abbott, the state's chief law enforcement official, promotes Texas's strong economy and lack of an income tax, allowing transplanted gun owners ''to keep more of what you earn and use some of that extra money to buy more ammo.''
The ads are a rare burst of political theater from Mr. Abbott, a former State Supreme Court justice who has built a reputation as a gentlemanly yet fiercely conservative litigator eager to challenge the Obama administration, and who, in a speech last year, described his job this way: ''I go to the office. I sue the federal government. And then I go home.''
Mr. Abbott has been laying the groundwork and raising millions of dollars for a possible run for governor in 2014, regardless of whether Gov. Rick Perry, his ally and fellow Republican, decides to seek re-election.
Mr. Abbott's ads were paid for not by the attorney general's office but by his political campaign, Texans for Greg Abbott. A campaign spokesman, Eric Bearse, said the ads began running on Wednesday and were ''interest targeted'' to those in Manhattan and Albany who visited several news sites, including The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times.
Mr. Bearse said the ads were created in response to New York's new gun-control laws as well as the executive actions that President Obama announced the same day to curb gun violence. He declined to say how much they had cost Mr. Abbott, whose campaign account has grown to $18 million.
''It's a somewhat unconventional method to weigh in on a very serious issue,'' Mr. Bearse said. ''It makes the point that Texans value freedom, and specifically their freedom to protect themselves. Our state has experienced the largest population growth in the country from places like California and New York because our culture does value freedom.''
The ads illustrate the extent to which the debate over guns and gun violence since the mass shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., has played out differently in Texas than it has in other parts of the country.
In Texas, guns and the right to carry them continue to be closely linked to the state's self-image. Those licensed to carry a concealed weapon can do so in restaurants, shopping malls and even the Capitol building here in Austin.
Responding to Mr. Obama's gun proposals, Mr. Perry said in a statement that he was disgusted to see the political left and the news media use the school shooting to advance a pre-existing agenda, and he suggested that prayers rather than laws were in order.
A day after the president unveiled his proposals, a different sort of gun debate unfolded here, after a Republican state senator from Granbury, Brian Birdwell, filed a bill to allow those with a concealed handgun license to carry their firearms on college campuses.
Mr. Abbott posted his ads on his Facebook page, creating an impromptu cross-state forum and occasional shouting match between New Yorkers and Texans on both sides of the issue. A woman from Jarrell, Tex., called the ads ''another embarrassing example'' of politicians in the state. Another woman in Texas complained of Yankees and their liberal attitudes, adding, ''Stay up North we don't want you in Texas.''
And one Republican New Yorker wrote that she was sick of Mr. Cuomo, ready to move to Texas and would greatly appreciate ''any info, regarding employment, schools, and city to live in.''
New Yorkers moving to Texas might find that the two places have more in common than they expect: each is as much a state of mind as it is an actual state. The century had barely gotten started when Mr. Perry declared in his inaugural address in 2011 that historians would look back and call it ''the Texas century.'' New Yorkers are as New York-centric as Texans are Texas-centric.
And there is at least one place where newly arrived New Yorkers might feel strangely at home: New York, Tex., an unincorporated community amid the green acres of East Texas, about 1,500 miles from Times Square. It is made up of a handful of houses, a cemetery, a church and Reynolds New York Store.
Carolyn Reynolds, who runs the feed and fertilizer store, paused when asked for the population. She started counting under her breath. ''Right now, I'd consider it 11,'' she replied.
Still, Mr. Abbott said in a statement, because of the state's low taxes and gun laws, ''our New York is better than their New York.''

Insurgents Attack Police Unit in Kabul

KABUL, Afghanistan -- In the second brazen attack on the capital in less than a week, five Taliban suicide bombers stormed the headquarters of the traffic police early on Monday, setting off a fierce nine-hour gun battle that raged into the afternoon and claimed the lives of at least three traffic officers. 
The attack began around 5 a.m., when insurgents shot and killed officers at the checkpoint in front of the headquarters, which is on the same road as the Parliament building.
After the firefight began, insurgents wearing suicide vests remotely detonated a huge car bomb and rushed into the compound. Throughout the day, rocket explosions and gunfire erupted in intermittent bursts, as an array of Afghan security forces tried to dislodge the insurgents.
The battle ended shortly after 2 p.m. with all of the insurgents dead. Only two of the bombers detonated their vests, officials said at the scene. The other three fighters were gunned down by the security forces.
In addition to the three dead officers, six members of the security forces were wounded in the attack, said Gen. Abdul Rahman Rahman, a deputy minister at the Interior Ministry. At least eight civilians were also wounded, mostly from the bombing.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the assault, the second it has carried out in less than a week. On Wednesday, heavily armed bombers blew up the gate to an Afghan intelligence facility, killing at least one security officer and injuring numerous civilians.
The consecutive attacks have rattled the relative security Kabul has experienced compared with other areas of the country. The group has promised to continue its fight against government targets in Kabul and elsewhere, creating unease among many Afghans as they prepare for coalition forces to withdraw troops from the country by 2014 or sooner.
''Our target was a special police training unit where foreign instructors and trainers train,'' said a Taliban spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahid. ''We inflicted heavy casualties to the enemy so far, and that is a part of our routine operations against the enemy.''
Unlike the facilities of the security services, which are heavily armed and protected by mountainous blast walls and coils of razor wire, the traffic police headquarters offered a softer target. Traffic police officers are not typically armed in the streets of Kabul, and the headquarters does not have the same level of security as the intelligence installations.
Still, within half an hour of the blast, the area was cordoned off by an array of Afghan security forces, as onlookers listened to the firefight from beyond the security perimeter. Periodically, debris from rocket-propelled grenades rained down on the street.

Algeria Defends Tough Response to Hostage Crisis as Toll Rises

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER and ERIC SCHMITT; Adam Nossiter reported from Algiers, and Eric Schmitt from Washington. Reporting was contributed by Hadjer Guenanfa from Algiers, Steven Erlanger and Scott Sayare from Paris, Alan Cowell from London, and Rick Gladstone from New York.

ALGIERS -- The prime minister of Algeria offered an unapologetic defense on Monday of the country's tough actions to end the Sahara hostage crisis, saying that the militants who had carried out the kidnappings intended to kill all their captives and that the army saved many from death by attacking.
But the assertion came as the death toll of foreign hostages rose sharply, to 37, and as American officials said they had offered sophisticated surveillance help that could minimize casualties, both before and during the military operation to retake a seized gas field complex in the Algerian desert.
At least some of the assistance was accepted, they said, but there were still questions about whether Algeria had taken all available steps to avert such a bloody outcome. 
American counterterrorism officials and experts said they would have taken a more cautious approach, using detailed surveillance to gain an information advantage and hopefully outmaneuver the militants. But others declined to second-guess the Algerians, saying events had unfolded so rapidly that the government might have felt it had no choice but to kill the kidnappers, even if hostages died in the process.
The debate over how the Algerians handled one of the worst hostage-taking episodes in recent memory reflects conflicting ideas over how to manage such mass abductions in an age of suicidal terrorist acts in a post-9/11 world.
The Algerians -- and some Western supporters -- argue that the loss of innocent lives is unavoidable when confronting fanatics who will kill their captives anyway, while others say modern technology provides some means of minimizing the deaths.
At a news conference in Algiers, the prime minister, Abdelmalek Sellal, portrayed the military's deadly assaults on the Islamist militants who had stormed and occupied an internationally run gas-producing complex last Wednesday in remote eastern Algeria as a matter of national character and pride.
''The whole world has understood that the reaction was courageous,'' Mr. Sellal said, calling the abductions an attack ''on the stability of Algeria.''
''Algerians are not people who sell themselves out,'' he said. ''When the security of the country is at stake, there is no possible discussion.''
It was the Algerian government's first detailed public explanation of its actions during the siege, a brazen militant assault that has raised broad new concerns about the strength of extremists who have carved out enclaves in neighboring Mali and elsewhere in North Africa.
Mr. Sellal said that the 37 foreign workers killed during the episode -- a toll much higher than the 23 previously estimated -- came from eight countries and that five captives remained unaccounted for. It was unclear how many had died at the hands of the kidnappers or the Algerian Army. The United States said that three Americans were among the dead and that seven had survived.
The prime minister also said that 29 kidnappers had been killed, including the leader, and that three had been captured alive. The militants were from Egypt, Mali, Niger, Mauritania, Tunisia and Canada, he said -- an assertion the Canadian government said it was investigating. Mr. Sellal said the group began the plot in Mali and entered Algeria through Libya, close to the site.
Other countries, notably Japan and Britain, have raised concerns about what they considered Algeria's harsh and hasty response. The United States has not publicly criticized Algeria, which it regards as an ally in the fight to contain jihadist groups in Africa. But law enforcement and military officials said Monday that they almost certainly would have handled such a crisis differently.
First, the United States would have engaged in longer discussions with the captors to identify the leaders and buy time, the officials said. In the meantime, the Pentagon, the C.I.A. and possibly allied security services could have moved surveillance drones, high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft and electronic eavesdropping equipment into place to help identify the locations of the hostages and the assailants.
''It would have been a precision approach as opposed to a sledgehammer approach,'' said Lt. Gen. Frank Kearney, a retired deputy commander of the United States military's Special Operations Command.
A senior American official said the Algerians had allowed an unarmed American surveillance drone to fly over the gas field on Thursday. But it was unclear what role, if any, it had played in the Algerian Army's assault that day. American officials said they had not been told of the strike in advance.
Prime Minister Sellal conceded no mistakes as he provided the government's first distinct timeline in the sequence of events, breaking it down into three episodes.
First, the militants attacked a guarded bus carrying foreign plant workers to the airport at In Amenas, and two people aboard were killed. ''They wanted to take control of this bus and take the foreign workers directly to northern Mali so they could have hostages, to negotiate with foreign countries,'' he said. ''But when they opened fire on the bus, there was a strong response from the gendarmes guarding it.''
After they failed to capture the bus, the prime minister said, the militants split into two groups: one to seize the complex's living quarters, the other to capture the gas plant itself, a maze of pipes and machinery. They invaded both sections, taking dozens of hostages, attaching bombs to some and booby-trapping the plant.
At this point, he said, the facility was ringed by security forces.
Perhaps late Wednesday or early Thursday morning -- Mr. Sellal described it as a nighttime episode -- the kidnappers attempted a breakout. ''They put explosives on the hostages. They wanted to put the hostages in four-wheel-drive vehicles and take them to Mali.''
Mr. Sellal then suggested that government helicopters immobilized the kidnappers. Witnesses have described an intense army assault, resulting in both militant and hostage deaths.
''A great number of workers were put in the cars; they wanted to use them as human shields,'' the prime minister said. ''There was a strong response from the army, and three cars exploded,'' he said. One contained an Algerian militant whom the prime minister identified as the leader, Mohamed-Lamine Bouchneb.
The second and final operation happened Saturday, Mr. Sellal said, when the 11 remaining kidnappers moved into the gas-producing part of the complex, a hazardous area that he said they had already tried to ignite.
''The aim of the terrorists was to explode the gas compound,'' he said. In this second assault, he said, there were ''a great number of hostages,'' and the kidnappers were ordered to kill them all. It was then, he said, that army snipers killed the kidnappers.
None of the Algerian reporters questioned the prime minister's version of events, and some spoke of a disconnect between foreign complaints about the way Algeria had managed the crisis and Algeria's protracted struggle with Islamic militancy over the past three decades.
''The terrorists came with a precise plan: Kidnap foreigners and destroy the gas plant,'' said Hamid Guemache, a journalist at TSA-Tout sur l'Algיrie, an online news site, dismissing criticism of the government. ''Did it really have a choice? If the assault hadn't been undertaken quickly, maybe the terrorists would have succeeded in killing all the hostages, and blowing up the factory.''
Some American counterterrorism officials conceded that point.
''If the terrorists were shooting hostages or at least putting explosives around their necks and their intent was to sabotage the plant, this might have been a suicide mission to blow up the plant, and not negotiate,'' said Henry A. Crumpton, a retired career C.I.A. officer and formerly the State Department's top counterterrorism official.
''It sounds horrible to say, but given the number of hostages and scope of this, this is not as bad an outcome as what could have happened, if that was their intent.''
In all, 790 workers were on the site -- including 134 foreigners of 26 nationalities -- when it was first seized, the prime minister said.
From the start of the siege, the Algerians were bound to respond with force, said Mansouria Mokhefi, a professor who heads the Middle East and Maghreb program at the French Institute for International Relations in Paris. The question, she said, was how bloody the outcome would be.
''Everyone knows the Algerians do not negotiate,'' Dr. Mokhefi said, and surely the attackers knew this as well.
After all, she said, the foundation of the Algerian government is its longstanding defeat of Islamist militancy and its restoration of a ''certain peace'' to the country after the civil war during the 1990s, when tens of thousands died.
''The legitimacy of this government in Algeria is its fight against terrorism and the security of the country,'' Dr. Mokhefi said.
Criticizing the Algerians for their harsh tactics, as the British and Japanese have done, simply shows ''a deep lack of knowledge about this regime, of its functioning,'' she said.
But the French understand the Algerians, Dr. Mokhefi said.
French officials have publicly supported Algeria's actions, in part because France needs to use Algerian airspace for its military intervention in Mali and wants Algeria to work harder to seal its borders with Mali.
''There isn't a military unit that would have done better, given the strategic conditions, the place where this unfolded, the number of assailants and the number of hostages,'' said Christian Prouteau, who was chief of security under President Franחois Mitterrand. ''I challenge any Western country confronting this kind of operation to do better.''

A Call for Progressive Values: Evolved, Unapologetic and Urgent

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; NEWS ANALYSIS; Pg. 11

LENGTH: 931 words

WASHINGTON -- He did not utter the words, but President Obama suffused his second Inaugural Address with the spirit of a favorite phrase: the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s call to heed ''the fierce urgency of now.''
This was a president unbound from much of what defined him upon taking office four years ago, a man clearly cognizant of time already running down on his opportunity to make his imprint on the country and on history. 
Gone were the vision of a new kind of high-minded politics, the constraint of a future re-election campaign and the weight of unrealistic expectations. In their place was an unapologetic argument that modern liberalism was perfectly consistent with the spirit of the founders and a notice that, with no immediate crisis facing the nation, Mr. Obama intended to use the full powers of his office for progressive values.
''We must act, knowing that our work will be imperfect,'' he said.
After spending much of his first term ''evolving'' on the question of same-sex marriage and doing too little in the eyes of many African-Americans to address poverty and civil rights, he invoked ''Seneca Falls and Selma and Stonewall'' and cited responsibility for the poor, sick and displaced.
He acknowledged the budget deficit but emphasized protecting Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. He mentioned jobs but highlighted global warming. He lauded the bravery and strength of the United States armed forces, but started his foreign policy remarks by asserting that ''enduring security and lasting peace do not require perpetual war.''
Mr. Obama came to office four years ago all but consumed by what he inherited: two wars and an economy in free fall. He then confronted an exhausting series of crises and political problems at home and abroad: budget showdowns, a huge oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, Middle East turmoil, the rise of the Tea Party movement.
Through it all, he chose to wage additional battles of choice, most notably his successful push to overhaul the health insurance system. But not until this point, with the economy gradually mending, one war over and another winding down, with Osama bin Laden dead and the Democratic Party drawing strength from the nation's changing demographics, has he had the opportunity to master his own presidency.
The policy details of what that effort entails will emerge over the next month through his State of the Union address and his budget, and many or most of them will encounter strong opposition from Republicans on Capitol Hill. Monday's address to the nation and its political class was intended to set out the value system that informs the policy.
Mr. Obama has always had a dialectical quality: pragmatism versus ideology, bold versus cautious, hawk versus dove, post-racial versus man of color. Those tensions no doubt remain.
But since Election Day, he has seemed to be choosing between them more than in the past. His decision after the Newtown massacre to embark on a full-scale effort to crack down on gun violence showed him to be less shackled to political wisdom about what is possible or electorally wise. His willingness to stare down Republicans over raising the debt limit -- and winning -- showed that he is less likely nowadays to start a negotiation by moving to the center and trying to find common ground.
To some Republicans, it is what they warned of all along: a president who ran as a centrist proving to be an unreconstructed liberal. It was no doubt hard for some of them to accept a scolding for treating ''name calling as reasoned debate'' -- a phrase in his Monday address -- from a man who won re-election by excoriating Mitt Romney as a job-killing plutocrat.
''I think all Americans would hope that President Obama, now that he's not facing re-election, would actually sit down and honestly work with Republicans who are very sincere in our desire to fix these problems,'' said Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin.
But, Mr. Johnson added, that was not the sentiment he detected from Mr. Obama on Monday. ''You've got to sit down in good faith,'' he said. ''But I just don't see that with this president.''
Representative Pete Sessions, Republican of Texas, said, ''I'm surprised we've so abruptly noticed after this election we're now managing America's demise, not America's great future.''
Mr. Obama's address nodded to ideological inclusiveness but did not repeat his view from four years ago that it was time to end the ''recriminations and worn-out dogmas'' that characterized Washington battles. It recognized the power of individual liberty but argued that only through collective action could the nation remain prosperous and secure.
But most of all, it sought to elevate to a more prominent place in the political debate the question of how best the nation should address the ''little girl born into the bleakest poverty,'' the parents of a child with a disability, the gay men and women seeking to marry, voters facing hurdles because of their race and immigrants seeking a toehold in a land of opportunity.
''We do not believe that in this country, freedom is reserved for the lucky, or happiness for the few,'' Mr. Obama said.
In many ways it was an address, given on a day that commemorates King, that reflected not just the civil rights leader's ''fierce urgency of now'' but the lines that immediately followed it in his ''I Have a Dream'' speech on the National Mall 50 years ago.
''This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism,'' King said. ''Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy.''

The Bronx, The Bench And Life In Between

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

SECTION: Section C; Column 0; The Arts/Cultural Desk; BOOKS OF THE TIMES; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 1414 words

MY BELOVED WORLDBy Sonia Sotomayor
Illustrated. 315 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $27.95.
''I think this fish has found her pond.''
That's what Sonia Sotomayor told a friend after her first day in open court as a new federal judge back in 1992. She had been so terrified, she recalls in her new memoir, that her knees were literally knocking together as she began addressing the courtroom from the bench. And yet the minute she jumped in with a question for the litigants, the panic passed, and she realized she would be just fine.
More than fine, it turns out: from federal court for the Southern District of New York she would move on to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and in 2009 she was sworn in as an associate justice of the Supreme Court. 
In nominating Judge Sotomayor to the highest court in the land, President Obama pointed out that her life story was the embodiment of the American dream. She grew up poor in a Bronx housing project at a time when gangs were carving up the neighborhood, learned she had juvenile diabetes when she was 7 and lost her father a couple of years later. She would go on to Princeton (where she won the prestigious Pyne Prize), Yale Law School, the Manhattan district attorney's office and ultimately the Supreme Court, where she became the nation's first Hispanic justice.
But if the outlines of Justice Sotomayor's life are well known by now, her searching and emotionally intimate memoir, ''My Beloved World,'' nonetheless has the power to surprise and move the reader. Whereas the justice's legal writings have been described by reporters as dry, methodical and technical, this account of her life is revealing, keenly observed and deeply felt.
The book sheds little new light on how she views issues that might come before the Supreme Court (aside from some candid talk about resistance she encountered, as a student, from critics of affirmative action), but it stands very much on its own -- not unlike Barack Obama's first book, ''Dreams From My Father'' -- as a compelling and powerfully written memoir about identity and coming of age.
Through evocative, plain-spoken prose Justice Sotomayor engages in an earnest, soul-searching look back at her childhood as the daughter of Puerto Rican parents and at her education and years as a lawyer. She provides a visceral sense of what it was like to grow up with a dysfunctional family, overshadowed by her alcoholic father's unpredictable behavior, and what it was like to grow up in the Bronx in the 1960s and '70s, in a neighborhood where stairwells were to be avoided (because of muggers and addicts shooting up), and where tourniquets and glassine packets littered the sidewalks.
The young Sonia's best friend was her cousin Nelson, with whom she began childhood ''almost as twins, inseparable and, in our own eyes, virtually identical'' -- except that ''he was smarter'' and ''had the father I wished for.'' Nelson would become a heroin addict and die of AIDS before his 30th birthday. Why, Justice Sotomayor wonders, did she manage to survive when Nelson failed, ''consumed by the same dangers that had surrounded me?''
The culture of machismo played a role, she writes, the ''culture that pushes boys out onto the streets while protecting girls,'' but her own force of will would prove crucial too.
That sense of discipline and perseverance stemmed partly from her determination to manage her diabetes (she started giving herself insulin shots at 7 because her parents seemed unable to deal with the procedure); partly from her awareness, as a child, of the precariousness of existence, slammed home by her father's drinking and her mother's angry response to his alcoholism (which took the form of working nights and weekends to avoid being at home). It was the love and protection of her grandmother Abuelita, says Justice Sotomayor, that gave her ''a refuge from the chaos at home'' and allowed her ''to imagine the most improbable of possibilities for my life.''
The self-reliance she learned as a girl would serve her well in navigating the high altitudes of the Ivy League and later the world of law, but it would also have emotional fallout on her personal life. She says her marriage to her high school sweetheart, Kevin Noonan, fell apart partly because of the demands of her career, partly because her husband said he felt she did not really need him.
She didn't think of ''need as an essential part of love,'' she says, but that was perhaps too rational a way of looking at it: ''The truth is that since childhood I had cultivated an existential independence. It came from perceiving the adults around me as unreliable, and without it I felt I wouldn't have survived. I cared deeply for everyone in my family, but in the end I depended on myself.''
As a girl, Sonia became fascinated with the idea of becoming a lawyer or judge from watching ''Perry Mason.'' Her first dream, however, was of growing up to become a detective like her favorite heroine, Nancy Drew. Her mind worked in similar ways to Nancy's, she told herself:
''I was a keen observer and listener. I picked up on clues. I figured things out logically, and I enjoyed puzzles. I loved the clear, focused feeling that came when I concentrated on solving a problem and everything else faded out.'' That rationality -- and her sense of herself as ''a creature of rules'' -- would prove useful in law school, and later when she was a prosecutor and judge.
''If the system is broken, my inclination is to fix it rather than to fight it,'' she writes. ''I have faith in the process of the law, and if it is carried out fairly, I can live with the results, whatever they may be. And knowing that the poor and minorities are disproportionately the victims of crimes, I'm loath to view the adversarial process of the law as class warfare by another name.''
Justice Sotomayor writes as someone with considerable self-knowledge, and she points out that there has been a recurrent pattern in her life. Whether it was Princeton, Yale Law, the Manhattan district attorney's office or an appointment to the bench, the challenges of a new environment would initially lead to a period ''of fevered insecurity, a reflexive terror that I'll fall flat on my face,'' followed by ''ferocious compensatory effort.'' She had learned from her mother, she says, that ''a surplus of effort could overcome a deficit of confidence.''
In college she received a C on her first midterm paper and realized she needed to learn how to construct more coherent arguments, and that she also needed to improve her English, which was ''riddled with Spanish constructions and usage.'' Over the next few summers, she says, she devoted each day's lunch hour to grammar exercises and to learning 10 new words. She also tried to catch up on the classics -- like ''The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'' and ''Pride and Prejudice'' -- that she'd missed out on in her youth, when there was little to read around the house besides Reader's Digest.
Fear of leaving anything to chance -- another legacy of her unstable childhood -- made her prepare intensively for classwork and legal cases. And her single-minded devotion to work paid off: just as she became adept at collecting gold stars as a schoolgirl, so she graduated from Princeton summa cum laude and, as a prosecutor, began racking up convictions. She credits her many mentors -- including Josי A. Cabranes at Yale and Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who helped set her career as a federal judge in motion -- with teaching her fundamental lessons along the way, which, she says ,she absorbed as a ''happy sponge.''
For instance, she notes that Warren Murray, the bureau chief in the Manhattan district attorney's office, taught her that, as a prosecutor, she could not appeal to logic alone, but needed to use emotion to make jurors feel the ''moral responsibility to convict.''
The state's case ''is a narrative: the story of a crime,'' she goes on. And: ''It is the particulars that make a story real. In examining witnesses, I learned to ask general questions so as to elicit details with powerful sensory associations: the colors, the sounds, the smells that lodge an image in the mind and put the listener in the burning house.''
This insightful memoir underscores just how well Justice Sotomayor mastered the art of narrative. It's an eloquent and affecting testament to the triumph of brains and hard work over circumstance, of a childhood dream realized through extraordinary will and dedication.

A Canadian man facing charges of illegal possession of firearms opened fire Tuesday in a courtroom in Cebu, killing two people and wounding a prosecutor before the police fatally shot him, officials said. The suspect, John H. Pope, who lived in Cebu, pulled out a gun and shot a lawyer and a physician who had filed a case against him, the police said. He then fired at a prosecutor in the hallway before police officers responded, said Cebu's police chief, Mariano Natuel.

Marchers Urging Stricter Gun-Control Laws Take to the Brooklyn Bridge

BYLINE: By SARAH MASLIN NIR

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 21

LENGTH: 664 words

It was an ice cream cone that brought Joseph Allen from New Jersey to the middle of the Brooklyn Bridge on Monday morning, where he was singing a song denouncing violence as he marched with hundreds of other parents and children to demand stricter gun control laws.
Several years ago, Mr. Allen, 46, an emergency room technician, said, he was held up at gunpoint in Brooklyn in the middle of the day by three teenagers while enjoying a cherry-vanilla ice cream cone with his wife. 
But it took seeing a portrait of Veronica Moser-Sullivan, 6, the youngest victim of the movie-theater shooting in Aurora, Colo., last year, eating an ice cream cone with a child's joyful abandon to galvanize him into action.
''She is the one telling me, 'God gave you a chance to live,' '' he said, showing the little girl's picture, which he carries with him. ''She didn't have a chance.''
Mr. Allen mounted the bridge for the march, along with a group of about 200 people, by some estimates, drawn together by a social media campaign begun by Shannon Watts, a mother from Zionsville, Ind., who founded One Million Moms for Gun Control after shootings at a Connecticut school. And he admitted that he had not always been against guns.
For years, Mr. Allen said, he carried a gun every day. To high school. The gun, which he had bought on the street for $150, went to class, along with his pencils and ruled notebooks, at Thomas Jefferson High School in East New York, Brooklyn -- his bully deterrent, he said. He was hardly the only one who had a firearm, he said.
Those were the days before metal detectors at high school doors, he added, and he carried the weapon until his mother found it in his sock drawer. She gave him the dressing down of a lifetime, he said.
''It was our worst fight,'' he said. The gun was gone. ''My mother saved my life.''
In 1992, after Mr. Allen graduated, a 15-year-old, Khalil Sumpter, fatally shot Tyrone Sinkler, 16, and Ian Moore, 17, in the second-floor hallway of his high school. Years before places like Virginia Tech and Columbine made school shootings numbly familiar, the killings drew intense public attention because of the setting and the gunman's youth.
Mr. Allen said he remained plagued by guilt that he never told the authorities about what some of his peers had carried in their knapsacks. ''I felt I could have saved those lives, if they had known we all had guns at school,'' he said. Mr. Allen did not know the gunman or the victims.
As an icy wind picked up across the bridge, the marchers, led by Scott M. Stringer, the Manhattan borough president, made their way toward Manhattan, to congregate near City Hall. Children waved banners and some of them shouted slogans denouncing groups like the National Rifle Association: ''Kids yes! Guns no! N.R.A. has got to go!
I love this song!'' shouted Luca Buitoni, 8, as he pushed his brother Giacomo, 5, in a stroller.
Mr. Allen, meanwhile, quietly sang a song he had written about Veronica and waved a homemade placard that listed the names of other shooting victims, from Abraham Lincoln to the rapper Biggie Smalls.
Madeline Smith, 59, clutched a photo of a young man -- her son, Kwame A. Dancy, who was shot to death at 22 by a friend in Harlem after feuding on social media in 2009. She said that she was happy people had been prodded into action by recent mass shootings, but that gun violence was constant.
''We're all hearing gunfire every day,'' said Ms. Smith, who lives in Brooklyn.
At the end of the rally, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said, ''This is a manifestation of a momentum.'' He said he hoped Congress would heed the message.
Mr. Allen said he was sure the march would have resonance. The protesters were marching, he pointed out, on the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday, and on the day of the second swearing-in of the nation's first black president.
''That's one of those dreams that came true,'' Mr. Allen said. His own, to curtail gun violence, he felt sure, would be realized too.

New Mexico Teenager Is Charged With Killing His Family

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 17

LENGTH: 516 words

ALBUQUERQUE (AP) -- A New Mexico teenager accused of fatally shooting his parents and three younger siblings had apparently never been in trouble with the law, state officials said Monday. 
A records check by the Children, Youth and Families Department indicated no trouble with the teenager, Nehemiah Griego, or his family, said Bob Tafoya, an agency spokesman.
Mr. Griego, 15, remained in custody on Monday on two counts of murder and three counts of child abuse resulting in death. He was arrested after the shootings on Saturday at a home in a rural area southwest of Albuquerque where he lived with his family.
Investigators found several guns believed to be used in the shootings, including one described by the authorities as a semiautomatic assault-type rifle. The owner of the weapons has not been determined.
''There's no other way to say it, except that we have a horrific crime scene down there that we are working on,'' said Sheriff Dan Houston of Bernalillo County.
The authorities identified the victims as Greg Griego, 51; his wife, Sarah Griego, 40; their 9-year-old son, Zephania; and two daughters, Jael, 5, and Angelina, 2.
''Right now, we're to the meticulous points of processing the scene and collecting physical evidence,'' Lt. Sid Covington, a spokesman for the Bernalillo County Sheriff's Department, said on Sunday. ''And this is a vast scene with a lot of physical evidence.''
Investigators were still at the scene on Monday but refused to release any more details about the shooting.
Greg Griego had served as a pastor at one of Albuquerque's largest Christian churches and was well known throughout the law enforcement community for his work with Albuquerque firefighters and as a volunteer chaplain who offered spiritual guidance to inmates at the Metropolitan Detention Center.
''Chaplain Griego was a dedicated professional that passionately served his fellow man and the firefighters of this community,'' Chief James Breen of the Albuquerque Fire Department said in a statement. ''His calming spirit and gentle nature will be greatly missed.''
Ramon Rustin, the chief of the Metropolitan Detention Center, said Mr. Griego was instrumental in the creation of the jail's chaplain program and worked to help inmates rejoin the community.
On Sunday, a police roadblock cut off access to the narrow dirt road that leads to the home, which is surrounded by trees and borders a farm field on one side.
Neighbors said they saw the first police cars and ambulances arrive at the home on Saturday night. The road was blocked, and word of the shooting began to spread through the area.
Peter Gomez, 54, a carpenter who lives about 200 yards away, said he had seen the family of six pass by many times but did not know them personally.
''It's a horrible thing,'' Mr. Gomez said. ''You see all this stuff that happens all over the country, the shootings in the schools and theaters, and then it happens right here. It's sad.''
The authorities declined to release details of any conversation Nehemiah Griego had with investigators. He was expected to make his first court appearance on Tuesday.

Paris Charges Man in Death Of 3 Kurds

BYLINE: By MAֿA de la BAUME

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 6

LENGTH: 355 words

PARIS -- A man who had served as an occasional driver for a prominent Kurdish separatist was charged Monday with killing her and two other Kurdish activists in a Paris office almost two weeks ago. 
The Paris prosecutor's office gave the driver's name as Omer Guney, 30, and said he had been born in Turkey. It said that he was under investigation over whether he had carried out the killings as part of a terrorist group, and that he was likely to be detained pending trial.
The prosecutor's office said that he was sometimes a ''guide and driver'' for the slain Kurdish separatist, Sakine Cansiz, who was a founder of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or P.K.K., in 1978. He was detained for questioning last week along with another man, who has since been released.
''We believe he is likely to have been the killer or one of the killers,'' the prosecutor, Franחois Molins, said at a news conference on Monday.
The three victims -- Ms. Cansiz, Fidan Dogan and Leyla Soylemez -- were all fatally shot, apparently with silenced pistols, at the unmarked Kurdish Information Center in central Paris. Their bodies were found early on Jan. 10.
The main target was assumed to be Ms. Cansiz, who had been living in Paris since 2007 and had been under surveillance by the French police. Security experts said she raised funds for the group in Europe and was a close ally of Abdullah Ocalan, the spiritual leader of the P.K.K., which is listed as a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union. He has been in prison since 1999, but he recently began negotiations with the Turkish authorities to end his group's three decades of armed insurgency, during which about 40,000 people have died.
Turkish officials have suggested that the three women were killed as part of internal Kurdish feuding over the talks. Others have said that Turkish ultranationalists were responsible, or that agents of foreign countries interested in the Kurdish issue may have been involved. The French police, according to Agence-France Presse, are also investigating whether extortion linked to P.K.K. fund-raising for the party may have been a factor.

Dolores Prida, Columnist And Playwright, Dies at 69

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Obituary; Pg. 16

LENGTH: 805 words

Dolores Prida, a Cuban-born journalist and playwright who wrote candidly and wittily about local and national politics, romance and other personal matters, and the joys and vexations of the Hispanic experience in America, died early Sunday in Manhattan. She was 69.
Ms. Prida was returning to her home in Spanish Harlem from a Saturday night party celebrating the 20th anniversary of a women's group she belonged to when she began feeling ill, her sister Lourdes Diharce said. Ms. Diharce accompanied her to Mount Sinai Hospital, where she died. An autopsy was performed on Tuesday, but Ms. Diharce said she had not yet been informed of the cause of death. 
Ms. Prida wrote several plays and the book for ''4 Guys named Josי... and Una Mujer Named Marםa!'' a high-spirited musical that appeared off Broadway in 2000. But she was more prominent as a journalist. She wrote a monthly column in English for The Daily News in New York from 2005 until 2012; at her death she had been writing a weekly column for El Diario/La Prensa, the New York Spanish-language daily, since 2009 and translating it into English for the Web site VoicesofNY.org, which is affiliated with the City University of New York school of journalism.
In addition, for more than a dozen years she wrote the column ''Dolores Dice'' -- Spanish for ''Dolores Says'' -- for Latina magazine, dispensing romantic advice, mediating family disputes and counseling mutual respect among factions in the Hispanic world.
A self-confessed media hound who devoured newspaper and television news reports across the political spectrum, Ms. Prida was frustrated by the lack of coverage of Hispanic Americans by mainstream news outlets.
''She was always perplexed at the idea that there was so little news about Latinos, this incredible sector of the U.S., and that what there was so often negative,'' said Maite Junco, a former editor of Viva New York, a section of The Daily News aimed at Latino readers, and now the editor of VoicesofNY.org. ''She'd say, 'If I have to see the video one more time of people jumping the fence in Mexico when they're talking about immigration ...' ''
Her newspaper work was aimed at correcting that gap. Her subjects -- gun control, immigration, parenting, education -- were approached from a Hispanic perspective. A recent column about censorship and freedom of speech focused on a Puerto Rican television show featuring a gossiping puppet known as La Comay with a penchant for homosexual slurs.
''The type of humor represented by La Comay and those mental adolescents of Spanish-language radio morning shows are repugnant to me, and worse yet, they don't make me laugh,'' Ms. Prida wrote. ''But since I have the freedom to move my radio dial, I never listen to them.
''That is the only type of censorship I can tolerate.''
Dolores Obdulia Prida was born in Caibariיn, Cuba, on Sept. 5, 1943. Her father, Manuel, who ran a clothing business, fled the island by boat shortly after the revolution led by Fidel Castro; his wife, the former Dolores Prieto, and their three daughters joined him two years later, in 1961, settling in New York City, where young Dolores attended Hunter College and worked at a bakery. During the 1970s and 1980s, Ms. Prida worked for the Spanish-language daily newspaper El Tiempo and a short-lived English-language monthly, Nuestro.
In addition to ''4 Guys Named Josי,'' a genial revue of popular Latin songs with a plot concocted by Ms. Prida about four men putting on a show in Omaha, Ms. Prida's plays include ''The Beggar's Soap Opera,'' a musical satire with a score by Paul Radelat that sets a tweaked version of the Brecht-Weill ''Threepenny Opera'' in the South Bronx of the 1970s; ''Botanica,'' about cultural and generational conflicts in East Harlem among an old Puerto Rican woman, her daughter and her granddaughter who has just graduated from an Ivy League university; and ''Casa Propia'' (''A House of Her Own''), a comedy set in motion when a woman realizes her life's wish and buys a house in East Harlem, much to the displeasure of her lazy, philandering husband.
In addition to her sister Lourdes, Ms. Prida is survived by another sister, Maria Aristizabal.
The women's group Ms. Prida was celebrating with on the night of her death was formed 20 years ago by Latina journalists and other professionals; Sonia Sotomayor, now a Supreme Court justice, has attended their gatherings over the years, including the one Saturday night.
''Dolores was a treasured friend,'' Justice Sotomayor wrote in an e-mail on Tuesday night, ''a pioneer in championing the cultural identity of Latinos in the United States. I saw and hugged her hours before she died.''
The group itself is known informally as LIPS, though it was originally LIP, for Latinas in Power, Ms. Junco said. It was Ms. Prida who added the ''S'' -- for ''Sort of.''

A state assemblyman who was arrested Saturday night on a charge of intimidating a public officer by threat of physical violence had targeted the incoming Assembly speaker, Marilyn Kirkpatrick, police officials said Tuesday. Sgt. Tim Bedwell of the North Las Vegas Police Department would not disclose the caliber of the weapon that was seized when the assemblyman, Steven Brooks, a Las Vegas Democrat, was arrested. He also would not say whether the gun was loaded. Sergeant Bedwell said the police were investigating whether other lawmakers were also threatened. Mr. Brooks was freed on bail after his arrest. On Tuesday, Mr. Brooks's lawyer, Mitchell Posin, said his client was hospitalized for internal bleeding. The hospitalization made Mr. Brooks miss a news conference that he had scheduled about his arrest.

Egypt: Rights Group Accuses Police Of Using Torture and Violence

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; WORLD BRIEFING | MIDDLE EAST; Pg. 9

LENGTH: 138 words

An Egyptian rights group on Tuesday accused the country's police of ''acting like a gang,'' torturing detainees and using violence to impose control. The report by the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights documented 16 cases of police violence in which 11 people were killed and 10 were tortured inside police stations. Three died under torture during the first four months after President Mohammed Morsi took office on June 30, it said. The police were among the most hated state institutions under Hosni Mubarak, who was deposed in a popular revolt in 2011. ''Police still use excessive force, and torture is still systematic just as it was under the Mubarak regime,'' the report said. It also accused the police of carrying out random shootings and collective punishment. There was no immediate comment from the government.

Bystander Shot Near Empire State Building Sues Police

BYLINE: By J. DAVID GOODMAN

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 18

LENGTH: 572 words

A college student who was one of nine bystanders inadvertently shot and wounded by the police outside the Empire State Building in August became the first one to file suit against the city on Tuesday.
The civil complaint, filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, accuses the two officers who fired their weapons of being negligent in how they handled the chaotic situation that erupted as the police pursued an armed man on Fifth Avenue during the morning rush on Aug. 24.
At least five other bystanders shot by the police that day have filed notices of claim, which precede a lawsuit, according to the city comptroller's office. 
The armed man, Jeffrey T. Johnson, had shot to death a former co-worker on West 33rd Street, outside a building where they had worked, the authorities said. As Mr. Johnson walked away, witnesses alerted the two police officers, who gave chase. Mr. Johnson pulled out a pistol, pointing it at the officers, but not firing it, according to the police.
The hail of police gunfire that killed Mr. Johnson -- 16 shots, according to the complaint -- also struck the nine bystanders, including the college student, Chenin Duclos, who is pursuing a doctorate in physical therapy at the University of North Carolina.
Ms. Duclos, 32, had been walking with a friend between Grand Central Terminal and Pennsylvania Station, on her way to a family reunion in New Jersey.
Ms. Duclos said she and her friend heard loud sounds, saw people running and then turned to run themselves. But then, she said, she ''felt this really intense, deep punch'' near her left hip that knocked her down in the middle of 34th Street. ''I couldn't move my leg,'' she said in an interview on Tuesday. ''My friend pulled me out of the street.''
The lawsuit charges that the two officers, identified as Craig Matthews and Robert Sinishtaj, ''failed to follow and to exercise proper police tactics and procedures'' by firing their weapons ''in the midst of numerous innocent bystanders'' rather than waiting to confront the armed man in a less-crowded area.
The complaint says that the officers ''escalated this situation'' and that Mr. Johnson had his gun stored in his briefcase and had not tried to confront the officers or any civilians until ''after being rushed upon'' by an officer.
The suit also says there was negligence by the Police Department with regard to training.
Steven B. Epstein, one of the lawyers representing Ms. Duclos, said that retired members of the department had reviewed video footage of the shooting and had determined that there were ''things that were done by the police in their tactics and procedures that were not correct.''
Paul J. Browne, the Police Department's chief spokesman, said the officers had done nothing wrong. ''How would one expect police officers to reasonably react?'' he said.
''A killer had struck just moments earlier, and police had every reason to believe he would kill again when he pulled the gun out again,'' he added. ''They had no choice but to end the threat.''
The bullet crushed the part of Ms. Duclos's left femur that connects to the hip bone socket, an injury that she said imperiled her ability to lead the active life of hiking, skiing and swimming that she had enjoyed since her childhood in New Hampshire.
''The bottom line here is that I'm hoping that no one has to experience this in their life,'' she said. ''Attention needs to be given to how police officers use their weapons.''

Gas Complex Worker Tells of Terror and a Desperate Escape

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS KULISH; Mihai Radu contributed reporting from Bucharest, Romania; Henrik Pryser Libell from Bergen; and Adam Nossiter from Algiers.

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 8

LENGTH: 1220 words

BERGEN, Norway -- After militants stormed his remote desert workplace last week, Liviu Floria, a Romanian gas worker, locked the door and sought refuge under a desk. For five hours, as he stayed hidden, he communicated by text message with a Romanian co-worker in another part of the sprawling In Amenas gas facility.
Then an ominous final message flashed on his cellphone from the colleague. ''I am a hostage,'' it said.
That colleague would later be found dead, Mr. Floria said, along with at least 36 other foreigners whom the Algerian government has identified as victims of the attack. But Mr. Floria's story is one of both terror and salvation as he and seven others managed to scale the fence surrounding the compound, trek through the desert and escape death. 
Mr. Floria saw the attack as it began last Wednesday. He and a colleague, George Iachim, were making their morning coffee when an alarm sounded. They rushed to the window and saw what looked like an action movie unfolding before them. Four men with assault rifles had gotten out of a car and were shooting at the guards stationed at the entrance.
''Out of a peaceful place, a normal place to work, in a few seconds it was transformed into a cemetery,'' Mr. Iachim later told Romanian television.
After nearly two days of hiding from the hostage-takers, Mr. Floria and seven others decided their only chance at survival would come from climbing the fence and running away. They left around 2 a.m. for what became a harrowing desert trek, guided only by the flickering flame atop a gas well in the distance and a compass application on Mr. Floria's iPhone.
Algerian officials said Tuesday that they were searching the Sahara for five missing foreigners, in the hopes that others might have escaped into the desert as Mr. Floria and the others did. ''It's ongoing,'' said a senior Algerian official. ''They've disappeared. We're not going to just abandon them like that.''
Helge Lund, chief executive of Statoil, the Norwegian company that is one of the operators of the In Amenas plant, said Monday in a televised news conference that 12 of Statoil's 17 employees had returned home, while ''extensive searches in and around the plant at In Amenas and at hospitals in Algeria are taking place'' for the other five. It was unclear whether the Algerians were referring to the Norwegians, who as of late Tuesday were still classified as missing rather than dead.
Mr. Floria recounted his experiences from back home in Romania on Tuesday. He was clearly still shaken by the experience and traumatized about the deaths of his colleagues, including two Romanians, and on Monday he had gone to a monastery to pray.
Mr. Floria, 45, said that he was no wildcat cowboy, no thrill seeker or adventurer, just a hard-working man hoping to provide a better life for his family. He had been employed in the oil and gas industry in Pitesti, Romania, for nearly 20 years when he was contacted through the job-networking Web site LinkedIn by an international recruiting agency.
The new job in Algeria as a mechanical foreman paid five times as much as he was making in Romania, where the industry was struggling and the future looked uncertain. With the money he earned, Mr. Floria hoped that he could send his teenage daughter to Britain for college and eventually buy himself a little house in the mountains. Safety was not a concern, he said.
He began work in 2010 and before long was used to the routine, one month in the Sahara working 12-hour days and one month back home.
The night before the attack, Mr. Floria went to bed early. It was a decision he said he believed might have saved his life. He woke up early, at 5:15 a.m., and he and Mr. Iachim drove in a Toyota Land Cruiser from the living area to the central processing facility a few miles away. They drove through the very gate that the militants would storm minutes later.
The two Romanians stayed all day and all night in the office, trying to keep quiet, subsisting on water and a few cookies they had with them. Long periods of silence were interrupted by minutes of gunfire and explosions. Mr. Floria tried to suppress his emotions and remain focused on staying alive.
''In my mind, the fate was we should escape from here,'' Mr. Floria said. ''I must stay calm, manage my feelings and we see what happens next.''
On Thursday afternoon, after more than 24 hours in hiding, they heard someone calling: ''Anybody here? Anybody here?''
It was Lou Fear, one of the Britons. ''When we heard his voice, we were very happy,'' Mr. Floria said, relieved to have been found by others who had eluded capture.
Soon a group of eight had gathered. There were two Norwegians, three Britons, an Algerian and the two Romanians. Word had spread that the attackers were targeting only expatriates and letting Algerians go, but the lone Algerian stayed with them, risking his life to help his co-workers, Mr. Floria said.
Someone in the group saw the attackers returning, and everyone went back into hiding. But that night Mr. Fear came back and told them there was talk of trying to escape. ''Sooner or later they will discover us, and they will kill us,'' Mr. Floria said. ''All of us agreed. It's our chance. We should fight for our lives.''
They were terrified of discovery. One of the would-be escapees knocked over something metal, and in the dead silence of the desert at night it rang as loud as a bell. Everyone froze and waited, but no one discovered them.
The fence, which Mr. Floria estimated was over six feet tall, built to protect them from the outside world, was now an impediment. But they managed to squeeze between the razor wire and the top of the fence, Mr. Floria said.
They were elated but wary when they made it out of the complex, knowing they were nowhere close to safe. If the attackers found them they would most likely be shot.
The group walked toward the beacon of burning gas in the distance, but when dawn came they could no longer see the flame. In their haste to escape several of the men, including Mr. Floria, had not thought about supplies, and the group had only four bottles of water for the eight of them.
Fortunately, the iPhone app worked without a cellular signal. They walked over barren terrain of sand and rocks and small hills, from about 2 a.m. until the late afternoon with only short breaks.
At last they found the gas well. There was a temporary building there, and at least one of the men was struggling to go on. Four of the men stayed and the other four continued to a nearby road. They saw vehicles but feared they might be the assailants.
They waited and watched from a distance. A white car with a green crescent looked like an official Algerian vehicle. They went to the road, stopped the car and felt incredible relief to find three Algerian security officers inside. The officers took the men and gave them cookies, orange juice and apples. Mr. Floria said the Algerians did not pick up the remaining four people despite repeated pleas. Mr. Floria's group was flown out of Algeria on an American military transport plane. The other four made it to the road once the sun had set, Mr. Floria learned later, and also escaped safely.
''I got pain in my bones, but this was nothing for me,'' Mr. Floria said, contrasting his fate with the dozens who did not make it out alive. ''We escaped.''

1913 Divorcee Who Shot Husband Acquitted
PARIS -- ''Not guilty,'' was the verdict returned yesterday [Jan. 22] by the jury of the Versailles Assizes in favor of Mme. Lamberjack, who on June 19 last shot and killed her husband at Saint-Germain-en-Laye. At the time of the tragedy, says the ''Figaro,'' Mme. Lamberjack was still living with her husband, though she had obtained a divorce a little time before. And it adds: ''This means the bankruptcy of divorce. Woman is now given the right to deal death, when and at what hour she pleases, just because once in her life she gave a man a kiss.'' All are agreed that for some years past the household had not been a happy one. 
1938 New York Crime Code Revision
ALBANY -- A new attempt to abolish the third degree from New York police methods will be made through a sweeping revision of the criminal code now being prepared for presentation to the State Legislature. This section of the bill, like the Holley measure which was killed by the State Senate last April after passing the lower House, would provide for the immediate arraignment of a prisoner. If a magistrate could not be found or were unable to sit, the prisoner would be taken to the nearest jail not under the jurisdiction of the police. The object of the new law will be, to preclude wringing a confession from prisoners by brutal methods.
1963 Fuel and Food Short in Europe's Cold
PARIS -- Europe fought today [Jan. 22] to keep the home fires burning. After 32 consecutive days of freezing and no sign of a letup, fuel shortages were becoming acute in many areas. In Britain, where open coal-burning fires are the rule of the land, retail coal supplies were down to a million tons -- about two weeks' supply. In London gas rationing began for the first time in memory, and the whole of Britain, took a 5 per cent cut in voltage today. A premature baby in an incubator died in a London hospital yesterday when a power failure shut off the heat and oxygen pumps. Other babies were saved by hot water bottles.

For Rape Victims in India, Police Are Often Part of the Problem

BYLINE: By GARDINER HARRIS

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 1333 words

NEW DELHI -- Not long after telling the police that she had been raped, a woman from South Delhi looked out her apartment window and saw the man who had attacked her laughing with an officer who had given him a ride back from the police station.
''That officer then came over and asked me why I wanted to file a complaint,'' the 30-year-old mother of two said in a recent interview. ''He said I would be ridiculed unless I agreed to settle things without an investigation.''
After months of intimidation from her rapist and indifference from the police, she got a politically powerful acquaintance to intervene, and her rapist was finally arrested. A court case is under way.
A far more prominent case, the brutal gang rape on a bus in New Delhi last month, and the later death of the victim, has led to an anguished re-examination in India of many of the nation's age-old attitudes toward violence against women. But even as India grapples with the polarizing issue, a powerful force stands in the way of any fundamental change: a police force that is corrupt, easily susceptible to political interference, heavily male and woefully understaffed. 
''If you're a woman in distress, the last thing you want to do is go to the police,'' said Vrinda Grover, a human rights lawyer based in New Delhi.
In many rape cases, the police spend more time seeking reconciliation between the attacker and the victim than investigating the facts. Over all, experts say, the police are poorly organized to deal with serious crimes, particularly those against women.
Pay is poor and opportunities for advancement are rare, leaving many police officers dependent on bribes to support their families. People without money or political connections are often ignored.
In the latest official move to deter further such attacks, the Delhi police announced late last week that constables would be stationed nightly at 300 bus stops around the city. The problem with this plan is that many women say the presence of police officers makes them feel less safe, not more.
The treatment of women by the police is such a concern that laws now forbid officers to arrest or even bring women in for questioning during nighttime hours. In case after case, the police have used their powers to deliver abused women into the hands of their abusers.
Police reforms have been proposed for decades, but few have been put in place, because many of them involve making officers less susceptible to political meddling -- something politicians have little incentive to seek.
Of all the problems affecting the police, many women's advocates point to cultural tradition as the most intractable.
Even as India has undergone an economic upheaval that has brought millions of women out of the home and into urban workplaces, a profound attachment to female sexual virtue remains deeply embedded in the Indian psyche. The foundational texts of Indian culture -- the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, ancient Sanskrit epics -- both revolve around the communal outrage that results from insults to a good woman's modesty.
''A woman's body as the site of cultural purity is the predominant theme in the epics,'' said Ashutosh Varshney, a professor of international studies at Brown University. ''And dishonoring a woman is equal to dishonoring a family and even a culture.''
As a result, the police and village elders often see their first duty after a rape as protecting a woman's modesty and a family's honor, instead of giving her justice.
On Dec. 26, an 18-year-old Punjabi woman committed suicide after police officers refused for five weeks to arrest the men who were suspected of gang raping her and instead pressed her to marry one of the men. So many Indian women end up marrying their rapists that the police often squander the first hours and days after a woman reports a rape seeking just such a resolution, said Ravi Kant, president of Shakti Vahini, a nonprofit advocacy group.
''That first crucial day is almost always lost,'' he said.
Delays are endemic and courts are backlogged. Of the more than 600 rapes reported in New Delhi last year -- far below the actual number of such attacks, experts say -- only one person has been convicted so far. In a vicious circle, police ineffectiveness leads many women to consent to marriage, but such marriages, sometimes reached after the police have gone to the effort to pursue a case, discourage adequate police investigations.
Suman Nalwa, a deputy commissioner in Delhi's police force, said that changing the mind-set of the constables, many of them from small villages outside of New Delhi, ''is a tough process. You cannot do it at the snap of a finger.''
At the same time, Indian police officers are few and poorly paid, and that makes them easily susceptible to corruption. India has just 1,585,117 officers to protect 1.2 billion people, or about 130 officers per 100,000 people, the second lowest among 50 countries ranked by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. Only Uganda fared worse; many nations have more than twice India's ratio of police officers to population.
More than 80 percent of India's police officers are constables who cannot investigate crimes or issue fines; most are assigned to paramilitary forces that do little traditional police work. Just 5 percent of police officers are women, though the government recently announced it would hire more female officers in Delhi.
''That the Indian police are performing poorly is beyond doubt,'' said Arvind Verma, a professor of criminal justice at Indiana University, an expert on the Indian police and a consultant to the government. ''The common experience is that the personnel are rude, indifferent, abusive, threatening and extortionist.''
An impermeable police hierarchy is another problem. Top leaders are taken from the Indian Police Service, an elite core of bureaucrats who never serve in front-line positions. It is all but impossible for a beat cop to rise to the top, making for a wide disconnect between police officers and their leaders.
Salaries are abysmal, about $100 per month for constables. Police stations often lack toilets and heat. Many low-level officers pay recruitment bribes of a year's salary to get their jobs, so demanding payments on everything from routine traffic violations to major crimes becomes a way of life. Such behavior saps public trust, worsening security.
''It is an unfortunate reality that police are not trusted in this country,'' said Nirmal K. Singh, a former joint director of the Central Bureau of Investigation.
Another important reason for that lack of trust is frequent political interference. Officers have few civil service protections, and politicians can transfer or punish police leaders at will.
Conspiracies between the police and politicians are common.
Hundreds of people have been killed in police shootings with political overtones, and blatantly political arrests occur frequently. Two women living near Mumbai were arrested recently for a Facebook post that politely questioned the deference given a deceased political leader. A professor in Kolkata was arrested after forwarding a political cartoon by e-mail, and a farmer in West Bengal was arrested after he asked a tough question of the state's chief minister at a political rally.
For the woman in South Delhi who said the police had refused to take her rape complaint seriously, politicization of the police means justice is available only to the well connected.
When her rapist threatened her 12-year-old daughter, she turned to her brother to call a high-ranking politician. Belatedly, the police sprang into action.
Asked about the case, a police supervisor said he would check on details, but had not responded further by Tuesday.
''During that whole time, I lived in fear of my husband being killed or my kids being kidnapped, because I knew the police wouldn't help if that happened,'' the woman said. ''I have no faith in the police. If you have money or connections, you can get justice. If you don't, forget it.''

Four More Years, Yes, but It's the First One That Really Counts

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY; Jennifer Steinhauer contributed reporting.

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; POLITICAL MEMO; Pg. 12

LENGTH: 1011 words

WASHINGTON -- The Constitution may promise President Obama another four years in the White House, but political reality calls for a far shorter time frame: he has perhaps as little as a year to accomplish his big-ticket goals for a second term.
As the president begins promoting his agenda of tackling gun control, immigration and climate change, even while bracing for yet another deadline-driven fiscal debate with Republicans, his advisers are scrambling to prioritize his ambitions to avoid squandering precious time. 
Tensions are already emerging between the White House and some Democrats about how much emphasis the president and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. should give their gun control measures and whether a drawn-out debate over the Second Amendment could imperil the rest of the party's initiatives, particularly on immigration.
The mass shooting last month in Newtown, Conn., elevated gun control on the administration's agenda, suddenly competing with plans to push for sweeping changes in the nation's immigration laws. Faced with a choice after his re-election in 2004, President George W. Bush chose to pursue a Social Security overhaul before an immigration bill and, amid partisan rancor over the Social Security fight, ended up getting neither.
For all of the revelry surrounding the president's second inauguration this week, Mr. Obama, his aides and Congressional allies know that their window of opportunity narrows with each passing month.
''You hope and plan for a year, with the understanding that it could be several months less or several months more,'' said Robert Gibbs, the former White House press secretary and longtime adviser to Mr. Obama. ''It does require having a step-by-step plan for the year because you have a finite amount of time.''
The tenor of the president's Inaugural Address on Monday, where he delivered a forceful argument for pursuing an ambitious liberal agenda, signaled that Mr. Obama might try to approach Republicans with a sterner hand than he did in his first term. Already, he has signed executive orders on gun control and, at least for the moment, forced a Republican retreat on raising the debt ceiling.
Yet some of Mr. Obama's most ambitious goals still require action from Congress, and Republicans still control the House. Even the Republicans' decision to agree to an effective three-month extension on the debt ceiling creates complications, by keeping the budget fight high on the agenda.
Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana, expressed the uphill climb with fiscal matters looming over the Capitol Hill, declaring: ''We have to do a budget. We aren't going to do anything of consequence here until the budget is done.''
The State of the Union address that Mr. Obama will deliver to Congress on Feb. 12 will offer the most definitive road map yet for how the White House will set priorities in his second term as well as how it intends to avoid becoming mired in a heated debate over one contentious topic to the detriment of the full agenda.
''There's no doubt you want to get off to a strong start, and we've got a pretty big dance card,'' said David Plouffe, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama who is leaving the White House this week. He ticked through a list of agenda items that included guns, immigration and fiscal issues, but he disputed the suggestion that one item would overtake the others.
''We clearly have this moment where we can get immigration done,'' Mr. Plouffe added. ''If we don't get it done, then shame on us. We've got to seize this opportunity.''
The president has been studying the experiences of previous second-term administrations, aides said, including how Mr. Bush decided to put his plans to overhaul Social Security ahead of immigration in 2005. The failed fight over creating privatized Social Security accounts fractured Republicans, energized Democrats and complicated the rest of Mr. Bush's term.
Andrew H. Card Jr., the White House chief of staff to Mr. Bush for six years, said the failure to pass immigration legislation stands as a lesson to second-term presidents, including Mr. Obama, that ''you can't get everything that you want -- that's an unfortunate reality.''
The first year of a second term is about accomplishment and legacy, Mr. Card said, and should be planned carefully before the attention starts shifting away from the president.
''It is the agenda year,'' Mr. Card said in an interview. ''He will command attention, respect -- and probably vitriol -- for probably the next three years. After that, he'll have to adjust to the klieg lights starting to shine on somebody else.''
Mr. Obama, like all presidents in their second term, will surely have to fight to stay relevant at some point, even if his advisers believe that moment is still well in the future.
The phrase ''lame duck'' ultimately creeps into every White House, former administration officials say, regardless of a president's stature. A gradual slide is likely to begin after the 2014 midterm elections, the outcome of which will help shape the last two years of Mr. Obama's presidency.
''There will be a new leader of the brand,'' said Sara Taylor Fagen, the political director in the Bush administration's second term. ''And you are not going to enact major reform the year before a presidential race.''
To extend the power of the Oval Office, the president has also already signaled that he intends to try to leverage his authority more fully through executive actions that do not require Congressional approval.
He has instructed his legislative aides and the legal team in the White House Counsel's Office to review all avenues, as he did with gun control measures last week, to pursue priorities that would otherwise be met with resistance from Republicans on Capitol Hill.
''You can't just sit there and kind of fantasize about what would be great to do,'' Mr. Plouffe said. ''In a lot of these areas, there are limits.
''But I think it's fair to say that we are going to continue to audit every idea and every possibility where we can do things on our own where Congress won't act.''

Man Kills 2 in Philippine Courtroom Shooting

BYLINE: By FLOYD WHALEY

SECTION: Section ; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 

LENGTH: 528 words

MANILA -- A fatal shooting in a central Philippine courtroom on Tuesday added impetus to a growing national debate over firearms regulation in a country with an enthusiastic gun culture much like America's.
Calls for tighter controls have been prompted by a series of shootings in the last few weeks, starting with the Jan. 2 death of a 7-year-old girl who was one of about 40 people around the country hit accidentally by celebratory New Year's gunfire. On Jan. 4, a failed local candidate opened fire on his village neighbors, killing 8 people -- including a pregnant woman and child -- and wounding 10. Then a gun battle at a police roadblock on Jan. 6 left 13 dead.
On Tuesday, a Canadian man, John Pope, opened fire in a courtroom in Cebu, killing a neighbor with whom he had a legal dispute and the neighbor's lawyer. He also wounded another person before dying of a gunshot wound; officials gave varying accounts about whether Mr. Pope had shot himself or had been hit by police fire. 
Filipino law allows citizens -- but not foreigners -- to keep guns at home, subject to registration and background-check requirements, and target shooting is a popular pastime. The country's president, Benigno S. Aquino III, enjoys sport shooting.
Guns can usually be carried in public with a permit, but a temporary ban has been imposed in the hope of curtailing violence associated with national elections scheduled for May.
The country's gun controls are not well enforced, said Norman Cabrera, secretary-general of the Ang Kapatiran Party, which supports tighter screening for gun permits and longer jail terms for gun crimes.
''You can go to any gun store and buy a firearm, and they will do all the paperwork for you,'' Mr. Cabrera said. ''You come back in a week, and you have your gun, your license -- even your psychiatric test is completed for you. All these things can be worked out for you by the gun store.''
Mr. Cabrera acknowledged that it would be difficult to pass stricter gun laws in the Philippines, where the police estimate that there are 1.2 million registered firearms and about 500,000 unregistered guns in private hands among a population of about 95 million.
''We have many influences from the United States; the gun culture is one of these influences,'' Mr. Cabrera said. ''Unfortunately, the Philippines has adopted one of the things that is not good about the United States -- its love for guns.''
Ernesto Tabujara, who heads a major gun rights group, Peaceful Responsible Owners of Guns, said gun ownership is a necessity in the Philippines,. ''We have rampant crime, and the police and military are often involved,'' he said. ''We are not as passionate about our guns as Americans. We just want to survive.''
Nandy Pacheco, the head of Gunless Society, an advocacy group, noted ruefully that mass shootings had been so frequent lately that an episode like the courtroom shooting ''is not news any more.'' But it was not clear whether the revived debate over guns would yield any government action.
''People are talking about it, and legislators are talking about it,'' Mr. Cabrera said. ''But we don't know if in a few weeks or months this will die down.''

4 in Hospital After Shooting At Houston College Campus

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ and EMMA G. FITZSIMMONS; Manny Fernandez reported from Houston, and Emma G. Fitzsimmons from New York.

HOUSTON -- A dispute between two men at a community college in the wooded northern outskirts of Houston led to a shooting on Tuesday that left four people hospitalized and touched off fears that the campus was the site of another mass shooting.
Instead, the authorities said, the shooting, at Lone Star College's North Harris campus, centered on an argument between two men, at least one of whom may have been a student or former student. Three people appeared to have been wounded by gunfire, including a maintenance worker who was shot in the leg. A fourth person, who was not shot, was taken to a hospital with medical problems. 
Joshua Flores, a senior, was standing outside the cafeteria with friends when they heard gunshots. ''We thought it was fireworks, so we didn't go anywhere,'' said Mr. Flores, 21. ''And then a bunch of people came running our way, yelling: 'The guy has a gun! Run! Run!' ''
The college, which has 19,000 students, was evacuated, and Houston police officers and Harris County sheriff's deputies spent hours clearing the buildings and deeming them safe. The campus was scheduled to reopen on Wednesday.
Officials with the Sheriff's Office said they received the first call at 12:19 p.m. They said they did not know what the dispute was about. No arrests were made, but the authorities detained and were questioning the two men they believed were involved in the argument. Both of the men were hospitalized with injuries and were described as persons of interest by the authorities. One of the men had student identification, but officials had not confirmed that he was enrolled at the college.
An official with the Sheriff's Office, Maj. Armando Tello, said there appeared to be only one gun involved. Major Tello was the acting sheriff because Sheriff Adrian Garcia was out of town.
The shooting shocked students, faculty members and administrators at the 200-acre campus. The school is in northern Harris County and about 30 minutes from downtown. It is so close to George Bush Intercontinental Airport that college officials said one can often look up and wave at the passengers.
Students said they did not realize that the shots were actually gunfire. Because the shooting occurred outdoors -- in a center courtyard near the library and academic buildings, officials said -- many heard the sounds. One student sitting at a table on the third floor of the library thought it was a book cart toppling.
''Later we heard people screaming, and we knew it was gunshots,'' said the student, Jonathan Moreno, 19, a freshman.
Mr. Moreno hid with other students in a back room on the third floor of the library in the moments after the shooting. ''It was a scary thing,'' he said. ''Some people were panicking. Some lady was about to have like an asthma attack. There were some people crying.''
Other students sat or crouched in classrooms in buildings with the lights turned off. Some fled classrooms and buildings so quickly that they left their belongings behind and planned on returning late Tuesday night to retrieve them.
Richard Carpenter, the chancellor for the Lone Star College System, said the North Harris campus, the system's first, was celebrating its 40th anniversary this year. ''In 40 years, this is the first kind of incident like this we've ever had,'' Mr. Carpenter said. ''The campus will be reopening tomorrow. It has been safe for 40 years. We think it's still safe.''
One freshman, Whikeitha Thomas, 21, had been in math class for about 15 minutes when he heard loud bangs. ''A teacher came in,'' Mr. Thomas said. ''She said: 'There's been a shooting on campus. Lock the doors. Turn off the lights.' ''
Mr. Thomas and his classmates hid in the classroom. In those tense moments, one of the students, a 23-year-old woman, collapsed. Mr. Thomas and another student gave the woman CPR inside the classroom and called 911. ''The lights were off at first until she passed out,'' Mr. Thomas said. ''When she passed out, they turned the lights back on so I could perform CPR.''
As Mr. Thomas was trying to revive the woman, she told him that she was more frightened than the others. She said she had survived the Virginia Tech shooting. ''She said, 'I went through this already at Virginia Tech, and I just don't like this feeling.' ''

Fourth-Tier Club in Final

The Bantams of Bradford City have been punching above their weight for quite some time, and now the club from West Yorkshire, England, finds itself in an unlikely place -- Wembley Stadium -- where it will play in the League Cup (a k a the Capital One Cup) final on Feb. 24. 
On Tuesday, Bradford City lost the second leg of its semifinal series to Aston Villa, 2-1, but that scoreline failed to erase Bradford's 3-1 win at the Valley Parade on Jan. 8, and they advanced on aggregate, 4-3.
Bradford plays in League 2, the fourth-tier of English soccer, and became the first club in more than 50 years from the nether reaches of the game in England to reach a major final.
"It's dreamland," Manager Phil Parkinson told Sky Sports. "We said tonight we had a chance to make history and we have done it. What this means to the club and the city is tremendous. I think we could fill Wembley on our own. To win it might be going too far, but to get to Wembley is great for us.""
Villa was the third Premier League club Bradford eliminated. It took down Wigan Athletic in a penalty kick shootout and then ousted Arsenal in another penalty-kick crapshoot.
Before Tuesday's elimination of Aston Villa, Bradford had been known for the events of May 11, 1985, when a fire raced through its antiquated Valley Parade stadium during a league match. Fifty-six people died.
Villa got back into the series when Christian Benteke scored just before halftime. But Bradford restored its two-goal aggregate advantage when James Hanson scored on a header 10 minutes into the second half. Andreas Weimann's late goal for Villa was too little, too late.
Bradford's only notable success since the club's founding in 1903 was winning the F.A. Cup in 1911. The only fourth-tier club to win a major title in England was Rochdale, which reached the won the League Cup final in 1962.
Bradford will play either Chelsea or Swansea City in the final. The Swans lead that two-game series, 2-0, before Wednesday's second leg in Wales.

Syria Evacuation Hints at a New Russian Attitude

MOSCOW -- About 80 Russian citizens crossed the Syrian border into Lebanon and flew into a Moscow airport before dawn on Wednesday, a small-scale evacuation that may signal the dwindling Russian hopes that President Bashar al-Assad will regain control of the country. The move came as a United Nations' humanitarian official emerged after a rare mission through the conflict zone to express shock at the scale of devastation.
Russia took pains to issue assurances that the departures of its citizens was not a large-scale evacuation, seeking to avoid sending a dire message to Mr. Assad and his circle. One top Foreign Ministry official said that the two Emergency Services planes had been sent to Beirut to deliver humanitarian aid and had simply offered a free trip to Russia for those ''wishing to go.''
The number of people who left was small, considering that more than 30,000 Russians are believed to live in Syria. Still, the flights had symbolic weight. 
''You get it from all directions -- if the Free Army catches you as a Russian citizen, they'll cut off your head,'' said Albert Omar, drawing his finger across his throat. ''Just like that. And from the other direction there are the bombings, the rockets. They're attacking the Free Army, but you hear it, the rumble, and you feel it.''
''Thank God they finally did it,'' he said, of the evacuation by Russia's Ministry of Emergency Situations. ''I called and called. And now they really came through for us.''
Briefing reporters in Beirut, Lebanon, the United Nations humanitarian official, John Ging, said conditions inside Syria were ''appalling'' and that he was ''shocked on so many levels'' by the scarcity of food, medication, clean water and sanitation. The United Nations mission, which was given access by both pro-government and rebel forces, found that after 22 months of conflict, Syria's grain production had been cut in half, with many farmers unable to harvest because they could safely reach their land.
''Every mother we met was appealing for us to understand the effects of this conflict on their children,'' Mr. Ging said.
He said Syrians' primary concern was to find a way to end the conflict. ''We appeal to those who do have the political power to end this,'' he said.
But a negotiated solution appears no closer. Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations' secretary general, told a news conference at his New York headquarters that after discussions with Lakhdar Brahimi, the United Nations and Arab League envoy seeking to negotiate a political transition, that he was not optimistic.
''The situation is very dire, very difficult,'' Mr. Ban said of the bitter fighting, in which roughly 60,000 people have died. ''We don't see much prospect of a resolution at this time.''
The United Nations is helping organize a donor conference in Kuwait on Jan. 30 in hopes of raising some of the $1.5 billion needed for humanitarian aid for the refugees and displaced Syrians over the next six months. Mr. Ban lamented that previous appeals from the United Nations had raised far less than was needed. In rebel areas, opposition forces are scrambling to raise money and broaden their donor base. Another official on Mr. Ging's mission, Ted Chaiban, director of emergency programs for Unicef, said grass-roots activists -- many of them young men and women straight out of college -- were conducting most humanitarian aid efforts.
Noting that the crisis would enter its third year in March, Mr. Ban said it was time for the Security Council to overcome its disagreements on Syria.
''The international community, and in particular the Security Council, has a grave responsibility to act to bring the desperate suffering of the Syrian people to an end,'' he said.
Russia and China have blocked repeated Security Council efforts to coerce Mr. Assad to step down. But Moscow has begun to publicly acknowledge Mr. Assad's losses on the battlefield and to prepare to protect its interests during a chaotic transition. Russia's top Middle East envoy, Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov, said Tuesday that Russian negotiators were interested in establishing closer contact with ''several new opposition groups, with those we have not been in touch with yet.''
''You know at first the forecasts were two to three months, four, and it is already two years,'' Mr. Bogdanov told Russian news agencies, forecasting the likelihood of an even more protracted conflict .
About a dozen Russian warships have been sent to maneuver off the Syrian port of Tartus, where they could also help to evacuate Russians from the coastal areas where many of them live. Any decision to leave would be particularly wrenching for the tens of thousands of Russian-speaking women who met and married Syrian men who were sent to study in the former Soviet Union and who now live across Syria.
At the airport in Moscow, Russian evacuees described a sharp deterioration over the last year. Natalya Yunus said she ran a salon on the outskirts of Damascus until the Free Syrian Army captured her neighborhood, asking, ''where could I go with no lights, no water, no money?''
''It was good for me there for a long time, but in the end it was terrifying,'' said Ms. Yunus, whose husband remained behind in Syria. ''Of course it's terrifying, it's a war, what can you do? There are machine guns, planes. And now I'm in a situation with no way out. There is nowhere to go.''
Her daughter, Anzhelika, said she had also left her husband behind.
''We ran,'' she said. ''How else can you put it?''
Rushana Vildanova, 26, spent the early morning waiting at the airport, waiting for her husband, Ali, who is a shopkeeper, and their 7-year-old daughter. She said Ali's mother had died when the roof of their house caved in after a bomb exploded in their section of Damascus, and he was badly injured. She said she left Syria at the very beginning of the conflict, and that in recent months, he confided that he wanted to get out.
''I left right when it started, he stayed behind because he never thought it would get this bad,'' she said. ''At first there were demonstrations, and it all started there.''
Natalya Ivanova was waiting for her daughter, Olga, who has lived in Syria for the last 13 years. ''What could she do? She took her daughter and she left, even though her husband had to stay behind,'' she said. ''And we are happy that she did that, she had to do that, and now she is here with us. If only for the time being.''
Nina Sergeyeva, who until recently led an organization of Russian expatriates from her home in Latakia, Syria, said that judging from Tuesday's operation, the number of Russians seeking to leave Syria was insignificant. There is no talk of evacuation in Latakia, she said.
''Of course it is a kind of sign, a sign that it is really scary and dangerous there, that what's going on there is a civil war,'' said Ms. Sergeyeva, who is currently in Russia. ''It's a sign that things are getting fanned up. There are so many ships in the Mediterranean Sea, and it's such a dead-end situation Syria -- there is no political dialogue -- that it is necessary to figure out the ways to get Russians out.''
Russian women who have remained in Syria up until this point have compelling reasons to stay, she said, but a formal evacuation announcement would have a powerful impact. If that happens, she said, ''Russian women will understand that this is the last airplane which will take them home for free, with their children.''
The sea route is secure, but evacuations from Damascus are likely to become increasingly difficult as fighting around the airport worsens, and there is a danger that rebels may target vehicles on the overland route to the Lebanese border. Security officials told the Kommersant newspaper last month that evacuating Russian diplomats from Damascus might involve the same unit of armed foreign intelligence officers that evacuated Russians from Baghdad in 2003.
The newspaper quoted an intelligence source as saying that the officers were ''ready for a transfer to Damascus; however, the order from above has not been given.'' Last week, Russia announced that it was closing its consulate in Aleppo, Syria, in the wake of a double bombing that killed 82 people.
Yelena Suponina, a Moscow political analyst specializing in the Middle East, saw the departures on Tuesday as the beginning of Russia's decision to carry out plans that officials laid out last summer. It was at that time, she said, that Russian officials ''started to understand that the situation around civil war in Syria would continue and that the Syrian authorities would not find it easy to return stability. This understanding did not come now; it came some time ago.''
She said evacuations had begun because Russians in Syria were demanding passage out. ''This isn't about politics,'' she said. ''The worse the situation becomes, the more people will want to leave.''

Invitation to a Dialogue: Media Violence

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; LETTER; Pg. 20

LENGTH: 359 words

To the Editor:
The National Rifle Association's cynical exploitation of concerns about media violence to obfuscate the need for gun control trivializes a very real public health issue. Recent articles in The Times (''The Real World Forces Its Way Into the Gamers' Universe,'' Dec. 26; ''Real and Virtual Firearms Nurture a Marketing Link,'' Dec. 25) and elsewhere dismiss links between violent media and real-life violence, but the truth is far more complex. 
Research repeatedly demonstrates that, for children, exposure to violent video games, movies and television programs is a risk factor for becoming desensitized to violence, lack of sympathy for victims and aggressive behavior. Proponents for allowing purveyors of violent media unfettered access to children dismiss the research because it is correlational and not causal.
But public health policy is often based on correlation between behavior and harm, and the correlation between media violence and aggression is almost as strong as the link between smoking cigarettes and lung cancer -- and stronger than other acknowledged public health threats such as the links between not using a condom and sexually transmitted H.I.V., and early exposure to lead and lower I.Q. scores.
Regardless of the role violent media played or didn't play in the tragic Newtown shootings, children are harmed by frequent exposure to movies, video games, music and TV programs that glorify violence. We shouldn't let the National Rifle Association's smoke and mirrors, or the urgent need for gun control and effective, readily available mental health services, distract from the problem of media violence.
We need to stop allowing children to be targets for marketing violent media, and to help parents understand its potential dangers and set limits on its consumption.

The Antidote to Fear

SECTION: Section ; Column 0; Editorial Desk; LETTER; Pg. 

LENGTH: 220 words

To the Editor:
In ''Someone's Knocking at My Door'' (Sunday Review, Jan. 13), Laszlo Krasznahorkai writes about his (our) ''deepest personal anxiety.'' His haunting narrative of fear and anxiety stalking and threatening him describes perfectly the deep personal and inner fears I see in so many of my parishioners and neighbors. 
I believe that it is this unspoken fear and anxiety that is behind our obsession with personal protection.
I talk with people who have, when you listen, a real fear, dread and anger against any number of dangerous stalkers. These unnamed, unknown dangers come in many guises: foreigners, minorities, different religious backgrounds, big government, politicians, liberals, authority at various levels, the list goes on.
I believe that this fear has an effect on all sorts of self-defense and protection choices: self-defense classes, gated communities, private police services and a huge upswing in gun purchases in the last weeks, as you reported.
As a Presbyterian minister, I believe that what is needed to counteract fear is community interaction, interfaith understanding, civic trust and neighbor helping neighbor -- the kind of actions we witnessed after Hurricane Sandy.
Simply put, we need faith, hope and love. Who is knocking at your door?

Algeria Gas Compound Lacked Armed Guards

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS and NICHOLAS KULISH; Clifford Krauss reported from Houston and Nicholas Kulish from Bergen, Norway. Stanley Reed contributed reporting from London, Adam Nossiter from Algiers and Scott Sayare from Paris.

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 4

LENGTH: 1002 words

HOUSTON -- The companies operating the gas facility in the Sahara that was attacked last week had chosen not to deploy armed guards inside the sprawling compound, leading security analysts to question whether the assault by more than 30 Islamist militants might have been slowed if security had been tighter.
Until the siege on the remote In Amenas facility last Wednesday, dozens of North African desert camps were thought to be virtually impregnable, with steel-wire fences, long-range reconnaissance equipment and army patrols amid the sand dunes. 
But when the attackers came, taking dozens of foreign workers hostage, they faced little opposition. Armed with mortars, grenade launchers and .50-caliber machine guns, the militants were an overwhelming force. But security experts said the armed guards found at most production and drilling facilities in North Africa and the Middle East might have at least slowed the terrorists, letting more workers escape.
''The attack clearly caught everybody by surprise,'' said Geoff D. Porter, a political risk and security consultant for oil companies in North Africa. ''Had there been armed guards, there could have been a different outcome.''
The Algerian government dismissed suggestions that it could have stopped the assault, which led to a major hostage crisis that left at least 37 foreigners dead.
An Algerian official, who requested anonymity because of the delicacy of the matter, said the attack was conducted in the dark by a heavily armed force that moved quickly over the border from Libya, making it hard for security forces to repel. Also, the official said, the government learned later how the militants were able to wage such a well-planned assault on the facility: one had worked there as a driver and presumably knew the layout.
Algerian law prohibits armed foreign security personnel, but it permits private Algerian armed guards. The operators of the gas facility -- a joint venture by BP, the Norwegian company Statoil and the Algerian national oil company Sonatrach -- decided to rely solely on the many Algerian gendarmes and soldiers who patrolled the In Amenas area.
Some oil companies operating in Algeria do use military guards or private Algerian security forces. ''It's company-specific,'' said Mike Lord, chief executive of the Stirling Group, which oversaw security at the In Amenas camp. There are risks to having armed security personnel at oil or gas sites, Mr. Lord said, including explosions that might be caused by stray bullets.
Algerian security forces provided ''perimeter'' and ''zone'' security at the In Amenas base, Mr. Lord said, and the Stirling Group organized escorts of Algerian forces to accompany employees when they traveled between secured zones. But there were no armed guards within the secured zones, Mr. Lord said, under the policy set by BP and Statoil.
There was a broad fence perimeter, and it was monitored 24 hours a day. No one could come near the camp without an identification badge, and no one without official permission could travel by air or road nearby. Attacks on Algerian oil and gas sites have been rare, even during the civil war of the 1990s, officials said.
Sonatrach has a security department that employs armed guards. And according to the Norwegian newspaper Verdens Gang, Algeria gave permission in 2011, after civil war broke out across the border in Libya, for private armed guards to be used at In Amenas, one of the country's largest natural gas fields. But BP and Statoil said they did not want the legal responsibility.
''We and Statoil decided not to have armed guards on site,'' said Robert Wine, a BP spokesman. ''Given the large military presence in the area, we took the view that armed guards were not required on the site.''
A Statoil spokesman, Bard Glad Pedersen, said the company would review its security procedures. ''We will go through all elements of this terrible event, including questions connected to security,'' he said in an e-mail.
That review should be conducted by an independent panel, said Stein Bredal, a former member of the Statoil board, who contends that the company underestimated the risks in Algeria. ''To be sure that the truth really comes forward, it's much better that people can speak frankly, and they have a duty to report whatever they've been through,'' he said in an interview.
Bernard Duncan Lyng, who was head of corporate security and contingency units at Statoil from 1984 to 1992 and worked with the company until 2000, said that when Statoil set up a facility in Nigeria in the early 1990s, it hired armed guards.
''The first thing we did was to plan where would the best place be to have our site, safety- and security-wise, and establish a system of armed guards, and we did that,'' Mr. Lyng said.
But while rare, attacks on oil company personnel in Algeria have occurred. In 1994, during the civil war between Algiers and Islamist militants, two Schlumberger engineers were executed at a Sonatrach site by militants.
Most big oil and gas companies have armed guards in their facilities, said Pierre Montoro, managing director of Erys Group, a French company that provides security to multinational companies in Algeria and around the region. ''People should be armed on these sites to contain the attack, for a few minutes, anyway, to allow the authorities to intervene.''
Executives in the oil and gas industry said that their companies could handle the extra security concerns, but that new defense measures would be costly.
''To recreate confidence, it will take a lot of hand-holding with insurance companies, service companies and investment bankers,'' said Badr Jafar, president of Crescent Petroleum, a regional oil company based in the United Arab Emirates.
Others were more dire in their predictions of higher expenses, and ultimately higher prices at the pump. ''This is going to drive up costs probably 20 percent,'' said Dragan Vuckovic, president of Mediterranean International, an oil service company that operates in Libya and Iraq.

Discovering A Park's Link To a Founder Of the N.R.A.

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; CITY ROOM; Pg. 24

LENGTH: 785 words

A few months ago, Andrew Soar wondered why somebody named Wingate was so important that a park had been named for him - the 5.89 acres in the shadow of Kings County Hospital Center in Brooklyn where Mr. Soar sometimes works out.
So he did a Google search of "Wingate." He learned that, among other things, George W. Wingate was a founder of the National Rifle Association and was its president for more than 20 years. 
Mr. Soar paused during his workout in Wingate Park the other day to talk about what he said was an irony: The city has a mayor who has made gun control a priority and has a park honoring the Brooklyn lawyer who wanted to "promote marksmanship.''
"I guess he was not a bad person," Mr. Soar said of Wingate, who lived from 1840 to 1928 and also helped start the city's Public Schools Athletic League. But Mr. Soar said he disagreed with the N.R.A.'s call for armed guards in schools after the school massacre in Newtown, Conn. "I think they should leave that to the police," he said.
Wingate Park fills about half a square block between Winthrop Street and Rutland Road on the fringe of the Crown Heights and Prospect-Lefferts Gardens neighborhoods. It opened in 1957, three years after George W. Wingate High School, whose campus covered the other half of the block and which was sometimes called the "banjo school" for its distinctive shape.
Wingate High School was closed several years ago after years of poor academic performance. The building, rechristened Wingate Campus, now houses four smaller high schools.
The city's parks department says the park was known as Hawthorne Field and later as George Wingate High School Park, something of a mouthful, as park names go. In 1987, the name was trimmed to simply Wingate Park.
So who was Wingate?
He was a lawyer whose name lives on in the Brooklyn firm of Wingate Kearney & Cullen, where Wingate's son also practiced (before and after he was the surrogate of Kings County).
As Mr. Soar discovered, George W. Wingate was a Union Army officer in the Civil War who was troubled by soldiers' poor marksmanship. "Soldiers who could not shoot straight were of little value," Wingate wrote in 1901.
He prepared rules for rifle practice in the New York National Guard that were the first of their kind in this country and, according to Wingate himself, "led to the formation of the National Rifle Association" in 1871.
(He started the N.R.A. with another well-connected New Yorker, the journalist William Conant Church. According to his entry in "Who's Who in America," Church had been the publisher of The New York Sun in 1860 and a Washington correspondent for The New York Times in 1861 and 1862, when he volunteered to fight for the Union. Church's time with The Times was not mentioned in his obituary in 1917.)
In its early years, the N.R.A.'s main goal, as outlined by Chase, was to "promote and encourage rifle shooting on a scientific basis." The organization's Web site says that in 1872, it bought a farm in what is now Queens "with financial help from New York State" and opened a rifle range there the same year. But "political opposition to the promotion of marksmanship in New York forced the N.R.A. to find a new home for its range," the Web site says. The state took back the land and eventually built the Creedmoor Psychiatric Center there.
Wingate's background was a surprise to some who frequent the park. "That's amazing," Edell Jamal Fair, a regular, said after hearing a summation of Wingate's career.
But Mr. Fair said gun violence was a complicated problem - too complicated to be solved with a ban on guns or background checks. "You have to have a clean record," he said, "but that doesn't mean you're a law-abiding citizen. It just means you didn't get caught."
On the swings in the park, Khristian Willis, 15, said he was "shocked" to learn who Wingate was.
Should the park's name be changed? "Honestly, I'm not sure," he said. "I personally despise the N.R.A. for what they said after Sandy Hook."
But he also said, "A pistol is O.K., not a rifle."
Across the park, Michelle White was looking after her four children. She said her husband was an N.R.A. member and, after calling him on the phone, she said he knew who Wingate was.
She took issue with President Obama's proposals to reduce gun violence.
"It's an invasion of the Second Amendment, and not his place," Ms. White said. "Criminals will get guns anyway. Only the law-abiding citizens won't have guns or will give up guns. That puts us in a place of trouble."
She said that women in particular should be allowed to carry concealed weapons. "There are a lot of muggings in this neighborhood," she said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Arms And The Women

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; OP-ED COLUMNIST; Pg. 27

LENGTH: 806 words

Women in the military are going to get to serve in combat. They killed the Equal Rights Amendment to keep this from happening, but, yet, here we are. And about time.
''I think people have come to the sensible conclusion that you can't say a woman's life is more valuable than a man's life,'' the retired Air Force Brig. Gen. Wilma Vaught once told me.
Vaught is the president of the Women in Military Service for America Memorial Foundation. She retired from active duty in 1985, so she remembers a different era entirely. ''I went to Vietnam, and when I found out I was going, the first thing I wanted to know was if I'd be trained in weapons. They told me I didn't need to be. That's unheard of today,'' she said on Wednesday when I caught up with her on the phone. 
''And,'' she added, ''I wore my skirts.''
Now they wear fatigues and tote rifles. So the Joint Chiefs of Staff have bowed to reality and told Defense Secretary Leon Panetta that ''the time has come'' to stop excluding women from combat positions. The transformation won't happen immediately, and it might not be universal. But it's still a groundbreaking change. When the recommendation became public Wednesday, except for a broadside from the Concerned Women for America (''our military cannot continue to choose social experimentation and political correctness over combat readiness''), the reception seemed overwhelmingly positive.
It's hard to remember -- so many parts of recent history now seem hard to remember -- but it was the specter of women under fire that did more than anything else to quash the movement for an Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution in the 1970s. ''We kept saying we hope no one will be in combat, but, if they are, women should be there, too,'' recalled Gloria Steinem.
The fear of putting women in the trenches has been dispelled on two fronts. One, of course, is the change in the way the American public thinks about women. The other is the shortage of trenches in modern warfare, when an officer on the front lines is not necessarily in a more dangerous position than a support worker. Shoshana Johnson, a cook, was shot in both ankles, taken captive and held for 22 days after her unit was separated from a convoy crossing the Iraqi desert. Lori Piestewa, a Native American and, like Johnson, a single mother, was driving in the same convoy full of clerks and maintenance workers. She was skillfully steering her Humvee through mortar fire when a truck immediately ahead of her jackknifed and her front wheel was hit by a rocket. She was fatally injured in the ensuing crash.
The biggest safety concern for women in the military is actually not so much enemy fire as sexual attacks from fellow members of their own service. Because the crime is so underreported, it's impossible to say how many women suffer sexual assault while they're in uniform, but 3,192 cases were recorded in 2011. Allowing women to get the benefits of serving in combat positions won't make that threat worse. In fact, it might make things better because it will mean more women at the top of the military, and that, inevitably, will mean more attention to women's issues.
The military's idea of what constitutes a combat position is more about bureaucracy than bullets. Today women are on armed patrols and in fighter planes. But they can't hold approximately 200,000 jobs officially termed ''combat,'' which often bring more pay and can provide a stepping stone for promotions. The system is complicated. But cynics might wonder if some of the military brass fear women's upward mobility more than the danger.
''We only have one four-star general who's a woman,'' said Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee who cheered the recommendation from the Joint Chiefs. It was, she said, ''a great step forward for our military,'' and one that wasn't really expected. Only recently, Gillibrand recalled, she and her allies declared victory when they merely got language in the defense authorization bill requiring the Defense Department to study the question of women in combat.
Women now make up almost 15 percent of the American military and their willingness to serve made the switch to an all-volunteer Army possible. They've taken their posts with such seamless calm that the country barely noticed. The specter that opponents of the E.R.A. deemed unthinkable -- our sisters and daughters dying under fire in foreign lands -- has happened over and over and over. More than 130 women have died and more than 800 have been wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan. The House of Representatives includes a female double-amputee in the person of the newly elected Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, a former military pilot who lost both her legs when her helicopter was shot down in Iraq.
We've come a long, sometimes tragic, heroic way.

Intent on Being First, Cuomo Used All Means To Enact Gun Limits

ALBANY -- Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo was in his 39th floor office above Third Avenue in Manhattan, after meeting with corporate executives to ask for help lobbying Congress for federal Hurricane Sandy aid, when he heard the news: A gunman had opened fire in an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., killing 20 children.
He called his counterpart in Connecticut, Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, to offer condolences.
''I didn't even have the words,'' he said. ''It was incomprehensible.'' 
One month later, Mr. Cuomo claimed victory, stunning many observers with the speed and apparent ease with which he pushed a gun control package through a divided Legislature. The State Senate, controlled by a coalition of 30 Republicans and 6 Democrats, approved the package, which included a significant expansion of the state's assault weapons ban, on its first day in session; the Assembly, controlled by Democrats, followed suit the next day, and the governor signed the legislation into law.
The weeks between the mass shooting and the bill signing illustrated the classic Cuomo formula, honed over years in public life and refined during his first two years as governor. Eggs are broken, speed rules, an open process is sacrificed, and results are achieved -- sometimes triumphant, often jagged and imperfect. Before New York's new gun control law was even passed, lawmakers were acknowledging that they would have to pass a second measure to clean up some of its errors.
Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat who is often mentioned as a possible presidential contender in 2016, had been determined that New York would be the first in the nation to respond to the school massacre. And he saw opportunity presented by change: the Senate, which had been controlled entirely by Republicans skeptical of new gun laws, now was governed by a coalition that included some urban Democrats who wanted gun control. The state's population was sympathetic too -- even on Long Island, a Republican stronghold but also a largely suburban region, haunted by memories of a 1993 shooting rampage on the Long Island Rail Road.
First, there were threats, delivered in phone calls or through intermediaries: He would seek to dissolve their fledgling coalition by pressuring his fellow Democrats to reunite; pummel recalcitrant Republican senators for months with a seven-figure advertising blitz backed by national groups like the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence; and campaign on Long Island, where 9 of the 30 Republican senators live, and across the state.
Then, there was the cajoling. Guns, he told the Republicans, were not the issue for them to take a stand on. He shared with them his internal polling data, which showed popular support for a tighter ban on assault weapons, even among gun owners.
There is a dispute over what exactly Mr. Cuomo then said to senior Republicans. A person with direct knowledge of the exchanges quoted Mr. Cuomo as saying: ''You think your record is good the last two cycles? Maybe you should listen to me? Maybe I should be your consultant!''
A senior Cuomo administration official denied that such statements had been made or that there was any contentiousness between the Democratic governor, seeking new gun laws, and the Republican Senate leadership, leery of such laws. But clearly, there was aggressive talk.
''He wanted to get this done, and he was push, push, push,'' said State Senator Thomas W. Libous of Binghamton, the chamber's second-ranking Republican and the governor's closest ally in the Republican caucus.
''Some people don't know how to take that,'' Mr. Libous added. ''I understand; sometimes I can be passionate too. Sometimes, when we want something, we push hard for it. The governor is trying to make his mark.''
Mr. Cuomo had been a longtime supporter of gun control, and after the mass shooting at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., last summer, he instructed his aides to begin developing new gun control proposals. But he had done little publicly, other than making an occasional comment at a news conference, until Newtown.
''I think for me, like for people all across this country, that was it,'' the governor said in an interview last week. ''You said, 'Enough.' That was it. It's not an intellectual response; it was more emotional, visceral. Just, it was enough.''
Mr. Cuomo, who has three teenage daughters, said he could not help but think of them.
''Anyone who has a child remembers the first day they dropped the child off at school and they remember that feeling in the pit of their stomach when they were driving away, that little fear that they felt in their spine that said, 'You know, I'm leaving my child; God forbid something were to happen,' '' he recalled. ''This said you were right to have that anxiety, because your nightmare actually came true.''
The governor's aides worked with several advocacy groups, including the Brady Campaign in Washington, New Yorkers Against Gun Violence and the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence in San Francisco, to develop a package of measures that would be comprehensive but also politically achievable. They looked to other states; a provision in the new law to require mental health professionals to report possibly violent patients was similar to a recommendation by a task force created last year by Gov. Martin O'Malley and state legislators in Maryland.
For a time, Mr. Cuomo and his team were so eager to act that they contemplated calling the Legislature into special session in December. By the time a few dozen lawmakers had assembled in Albany the week before Christmas for an economic development meeting, negotiations were moving so rapidly that the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, instructed his members not to leave the capital until they had called his office -- just in case a gun control deal was ready.
The Assembly was clearly ready to support new gun control, so Mr. Cuomo focused his lobbying on the Senate, where the outcome was less certain.
A few days after the shooting, the Senate Democrats had chosen a new leader, Andrea Stewart-Cousins of Westchester County. Mr. Cuomo invited her to visit. When she arrived, he offered his congratulations and then turned to gun control. By the end of the session, Senator Stewart-Cousins had pledged that all 26 members of her caucus would support his effort.
Mr. Cuomo believed he could get the votes to pass a gun control measure in the Senate, but any doubt was erased by a Dec. 24 ambush in Webster, near Rochester, in which a lone gunman set fire to a car and his house, then killed two firefighters who responded.
''To the extent the Legislature needed any reinforcement, there was no question after Webster,'' Mr. Cuomo said.
He courted a newly elected senator, Simcha Felder, a Democrat from Brooklyn who had decided to align himself with the Republican caucus. And he sat down with the five Democrats whose Independent Democratic Conference had struck a power-sharing agreement with the Senate Republicans; afterward, their leader, Senator Jeffrey D. Klein, a Bronx Democrat, told reporters he was squarely behind the governor's effort.
Even with the votes, Mr. Cuomo still had to ensure that the Senate Republican leader, Dean G. Skelos of Long Island, would not try to prevent the bill from coming to the floor. Senator Skelos and his aides wanted to impose stiffer penalties on the use of illegal guns; extend and expand Kendra's Law, which empowers judges to order mentally ill patients to receive outpatient treatment; and soften some of the new provisions restricting assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.
Mr. Cuomo was open to the first two of those requests, and he also did not push the Legislature to approve microstamping, a controversial form of ballistics identification, which he had supported but which had been met with resistance by Republicans. In an effort to further mollify their conference, the Senate Republican leadership distributed to their members a one-page handout listing 15 ''rejected Democrat proposals,'' crediting themselves with rebuffing, among other things, a suggestion to confiscate guns now deemed assault weapons and limit gun purchases to one per month. ''Can buy unlimited number of guns,'' the senators were reassured.
The weekend after the Jan. 9 State of the State address, Mr. Cuomo and his allies received some help: A poll by Newsday and Siena College found that more than 7 in 10 residents on Long Island supported an expanded ban on assault weapons. Recalling the Newsday poll, Speaker Silver said, ''I think it may have sealed it.''
On the first full day of the Legislative session, the Senate Republicans met behind closed doors for several hours to discuss the measure, while gun-rights activists tried, futilely, to put the brakes on a deal. The head of the state's National Rifle Association affiliate, Thomas H. King, showed up at the office of the Senate Republicans; Mr. Skelos, he said later, would not see him.
Around 9 p.m., Senator Gregory R. Ball of Putnam County, a gun-rights advocate and avid trap shooter, emerged from the Republicans' private meeting with a defeated look. ''I don't think any lives will be saved today,'' he said. ''The only life that may have been helped is the political life of Andrew Cuomo running for president.''
Later, on his way to the floor, Mr. Skelos acknowledged that the gun issue was ''difficult for many to deal with,'' but he described the final bill as ''well balanced.'' He voted for it, as did all of his Long Island colleagues in the Senate who were present.

Dormant but Not Forgotten

Winter is a lie.
We cry that the earth is draggy, the garden defunct. But as usual we're actually whimpering about ourselves. In his poem ''Snow,'' published in the September issue of Poetry magazine, Frederick Seidel touches the great white void:
Snow is what it does.
It falls and it stays and it goes.
It melts and it is here somewhere. 
We all will get there.
Maybe it's a koan, but wherever ''there'' is, I'd rather be someplace else.
Which takes us back to the lie of winter -- or shall we call it a misunderstanding? For in truth, our gardens haven't gone anywhere at all. It is we who have elected to migrate someplace else for the season; that is, to a cocoon made of duvet, cookie crumbs and tubs of Eucerin.
A week or two ago, I stirred myself from such a couch coma and set out to discover the lost continent called ''outside.'' Here is what I found. The grass was not dun-colored, but green; the ground was not frozen, but soft underfoot. Camellias were in bloom -- outside the great glass conservatory at the New York Botanical Garden. And crocus bulbs were breaking ground just north of 59th Street in Central Park.
Apparently, it was time to do a rethink of January in New York.
My first field guide was Renuka Sankaran, a 36-year-old assistant professor of biology at Lehman College of the City University of New York. She started by overturning one of my fundamental misconceptions: most of the plants I could see in the home garden area at the botanical garden were not struggling to stave off death. They were comfortably dormant.
''The grass and the evergreens are really well prepared for their stress at this time,'' Dr. Sankaran said. ''They've gone through a pre-dormancy period. It's how they become cold-resistant.''
She pointed to a stand of conifers, mostly tall firs, on the park's perimeter. In the fall, a tree's leaves or needles begin to detect environmental cues. The nights roll out the black carpet. The daylight hours also grow shorter, but a tree, like a teenage goth, heeds darkness. (''It's just semantics,'' Dr. Sankaran said -- or, perhaps, the province of the philosophy department.) Temperatures fall below 4 degrees Celsius for a couple of hours before dawn.
This would be hat weather, except that few trees own hats. Instead, a cold-tolerant plant starts to produce abscisic acid, or ABA. This stress hormone travels through the sap and activates a set of genes that, in turn, produce cryoprotectant solutes in the cells. In a phrase, plant antifreeze.
''We don't know a lot about these,'' Dr. Sankaran said. In a broad sense, when a plant runs into severe cold, ''The water cools really fast below the theoretical freezing point of zero Celsius. And it maintains its liquid state. It can go to negative 40 Celsius,'' or even a few degrees lower.
The temperature at the garden around noon was closer to 40 degrees Fahrenheit. The sun was putting in an honest day's work. On an afternoon like this, Dr. Sankaran said, anything green was probably photosynthesizing. ''You can't take a ruler and take a measurement of the grass,'' she said. ''It's not going to grow much at all.''
The rule for a hardy species in winter, as the late Curtis Mayfield might have put it, is to keep on keeping on.
For all her comfort with cold-climate botany, Dr. Sankaran said that she had gone through her own period of winter shock and acclimatization. ''I grew up in the southern part of India,'' she said. ''I didn't ever have to wear a jacket, a sweater, ever.''
When she arrived in southern Illinois 14 years ago to continue her university studies, she observed autumn color for the first time. ''The campus was so beautiful. I loved my fall. It was as I'd seen it in the movies.''
''It was the same that winter, too,'' she continued. ''Until I stepped out on the ice. And I hated it.''
YOU CAN BULL YOUR WAY THROUGH winter, or you can wait it out. Patience is the guiding principle for the shameless leaf-shedders, said Jamie Boyer, 41, an evolutionary biologist and the vice president of children's education at the botanical garden.
''We think of deciduousness connected to cold,'' he said. ''Ultimately, it seems to be a condition that's developed to respond to drought. We see them'' -- that is, deciduous plants -- ''in tropical dry areas.''
You could almost call it a matter of self-restraint, an angiosperm's version of Lap-Band surgery. January's frozen ground brings a dry spell. Yet, Dr. Boyer said, ''on a nice sunny day, if that plant had leaves, it would want to photosynthesize. If water is limiting, that's going to cause problems for a plant. It's like sucking on a straw with nothing at the bottom of the cup.''
It helps here to picture the hydraulic system that is, say, an oak tree. ''As long as the temperature is warm and they're exposed to light, their stomata are going to open,'' Dr. Boyer said. ''Water is moving through them. It's almost a passive process.'' Dozens of gallons of water (some 90 percent of each day's drink) transpire through the leaves and into the air.
And if the ground is dry? Ditch the leaves.
The rhododendron, a broadleaf evergreen, was playing out a different gambit. ''It has decided to hold on to its leaves,'' Dr. Boyer said, which are ''tough and leathery.'' The result is that the plant ''can be doing some photosynthesis on a day like this, where this Japanese maple there has nothing going on. You lose today, buddy!''
Dr. Boyer is the co-director of the garden's citizen-science program, which dispatches participants around the grounds to make phenological observations. That is, to detail the seasonal changes in the environment.
Parishes and towns in the Burgundy region of France have recorded the date of the pinot noir grape harvest every year since 1370. But before you can make sense of phenology, you have to recognize the plants. It wasn't until 1819 that the botanist John Torrey published the city's first thorough flora, ''A Catalogue of Plants Growing Spontaneously Within Thirty Miles of the City of New-York.''
Methodical phenological data at the botanical garden goes back just a decade. But it was Dr. Boyer's nonscientific reckoning that bulbs appeared to be shooting up at the garden this year ''pretty stinking early.''
NEW YORK WINTERS used to be wintry. Just how frigid is hard to say, explained Eric W. Sanderson, the senior conservation ecologist for the Wildlife Conservation Society, in the Bronx.
''We have anecdotal evidence from the historical record that indicates winters of the past were colder,'' Dr. Sanderson, 45, said over the phone. ''During the American Revolution -- 1779 to 1780 -- it was so cold that the upper harbor of New York froze solid. The British brought canon with oxen and horses across the ice from Staten Island to the Battery.''
The island of Manhattan was a British garrison and a redoubt for the loyalists who clustered there. ''People froze to death on the streets for lack of firewood,'' Dr. Sanderson said. ''Manhattan becomes denuded: They cut down almost every tree in Manhattan.''
It was a British headquarters map from this era that inspired Dr. Sanderson's 2009 book, ''Mannahatta,'' a kind of ecological time machine that transports the reader back to the borough as it might have appeared in 1609. The winter landscape, while in some sense unknowable, would have been vastly different, he said.
White pines, 150 feet tall, towered above the deciduous tree canopy as the island's original skyscrapers. At chest height, the trunks of the American chestnuts might have spanned 12 or even 15 feet in diameter. A studio apartment could fit in that footprint. These forest titans probably shaded out the understory. In the winter, you could see deep into the woods.
Parts of Harlem, by contrast, were likely open, a kind of grassland savanna. The native people known as the Lenape probably burned the brush to clear land for hunting. Their winter, Dr. Sanderson suspects, was spent outside.
''We complain how cold it is,'' Dr. Sanderson said. ''But can you imagine if you just had a deerskin cloak or two and you lived in a wigwam that might be 50 square feet, and 4 or 5 people might have lived in there, and it would have been smoky, because people would have been preparing food. There would have been every incentive to leave the wigwam.''
It was late afternoon and a sunny 46 degrees outside, and Dr. Sanderson was ensconced in his office. It's hard to imagine the Lenape ''staying cooped up in such a small space,'' he said, ''when there was such a large space around you.''
ONE OF DR. SANDERSON'S ONGOING efforts is to expand the ecological survey of ''Mannahatta'' to all five boroughs. For now, his Welikia Project allows visitors to select any block in Manhattan and explore the likely ecosystem of 400 years ago.
The site's recreated census for the southernmost band of Central Park doesn't include chickweed, or Japanese knotweed, or mugwort. Yet on a recent Monday morning, all these arrivistes could be spotted at the Pond's edge by Marechal Brown, the director of horticulture for the parks department, and Crista Carmody, a park manager and horticulturist.
Winter, Ms. Brown said, ''gives the gardeners a break. We don't have to weed all the time.''
The plants might not be growing much, but they are hanging on. Ms. Carmody, 50, knelt to examine a patch of green, stopping on a low, lacy plant. ''I think mugwort comes out early,'' she said.
Ms. Brown, 57, examined it herself. ''It's a beautiful plant in the spring. It's related to tarragon. It has a similar root structure.''
The plant would not remain cute, Ms. Carmody said. ''It grows to two or three feet and takes over. It's terribly invasive.''
Ms. Brown agreed, but added, ''It also makes good pesto -- early, before it flowers.''
The chickweed, too, appeared undaunted by the season. ''They call it an annual,'' Ms. Carmody said. ''But that plant could reseed four or five or six times during a season.''
Ms. Brown added, ''The mother plant dies.''
Ms. Carmody said, ''It's like rats.''
Ms. Brown agreed. ''Or gerbils,'' she said. ''Don't let your kids get gerbils.''
By some estimates, the number of plant species in New York has doubled since the Colonial era. As Ms. Carmody noted: ''A lot of the invasive weeds come out earlier in the spring than the natives. They can start spreading, while the natives are smarter. They don't want to risk a late frost. They say, the weather is faking us out; this is just a warm day. We're going to wait.''
Of course, the natives in the park were probably introduced here, too. The entirety of Central Park, Ms. Brown said, was an invented landscape. The boulders had been sandblasted to create a smoother surface; a brook had been scooped out to form this lake.
In the winter of 1857, the year Frederick Law Olmsted began laying out the park, the Hudson River froze solid. Witnesses logged the sight of a few boys treading the ice floes from Hubert Street in Manhattan to Hoboken and back. In the winters of the 1860s and '70s, ice skaters flocked to the Pond, a scene captured in a vivid and popular Charles Parsons lithograph, published by Currier & Ives.
Today, even the shallows along the banks were barely frozen. A few feet from shore, the phragmites (a common reed, native but noxious) appeared green in spots. So did the Japanese knotweed.
This ''makes a really good pie,'' Ms. Brown said. ''It tastes like rhubarb: strawberry-knotweed pie.''
The park was filling up with large cameras attached to small tourists and humans tethered to dogs.
Ms. Carmody observed, ''One of our other horticultural stresses.''
Ms. Brown nodded, ''Four-legged weeds.''
In the winter, she added, less garbage piled up. And freed from the need to mow, park staff could spend their time pruning and trimming. If you are going to garden in January, she said, ''you want to do activities. They keep you warm.''
Then Ms. Brown took a few steps off the pavement and did something shocking. She bent down and buried her fingers in a strange and unknown patch of New York City dirt, lifting it up for inspection. ''It's nice soil,'' she said.
Ms. Carmody said, ''It's not frozen.''
The parks department lost the November planting season to Hurricane Sandy. And while few horticulture books would endorse it, the department's gardeners have been known to sink dormant trees and shrubs in this cold earth.
''Last winter,'' Ms. Carmody said, ''I think people were still putting in bulbs in January.''
Central Park, it seems, isn't slumbering at all. It isn't even napping. The only way this winter garden could be more congenial is if the weather were a little warmer. Say, 70 degrees and sunny.
The Smart Money's on Bulbs
You don't need all your faculties to garden in the teeth of January. But a pickax would be handy.
Marechal Brown, the director of horticulture for New York City's parks, encourages gardeners to transplant before December or after March. But her department sometimes finds itself in November with 350,000 bulbs and 55,000 shrubs, ground covers and perennials to get in the ground. ''We break our own rules all the time,'' Ms. Brown said. ''I've planted daffodil bulbs in the snow in January.''
In a typical New York City winter, only the top few inches of soil will freeze. A heavy layer of mulch can help defrost the surface. (A trashier option would be to temporarily spread a clear or black plastic ground cloth.) When that doesn't work, there's always the pickax.
''I've heard of desperate gardeners who got a backhoe to plant their bulbs,'' Ms. Brown said. It's a free country.
Planting during winter is ''always a gamble,'' she added. Trees and shrubs are long shots -- a sucker's bet, really. They may seem well-adapted to cold. But the constant thawing and freezing spooks them on a cellular level.
The smart money is on bulbs, ''one of the toughest things you can plant,'' Ms. Brown said. And if it goes wrong, the dead stay buried. ''The great thing with bulbs is you can't really tell if this bulb or that bulb survived.''
Don't have the strong back or the hard heart for grave digging? You can always scatter a few handfuls of sunflower seeds, she said. If they take, you sowed a flower. If not, you fed a sparrow. Winter is a time to hedge your bets.
Instead of trying to grow something, why not lop something off? Shrubby perennials like butterfly bush, caryopteris and summer-blooming spirea can be pruned now. ''Some of those grow so fast,'' Ms. Brown said, ''you can cut them almost down to the ground and they grow all the way back.''
Or take a saw to the crossed limbs of an evergreen, an oak or a maple. A chilly surgical theater limits post-op infections. And in winter, you don't have to be an artist to find the right form. ''The branching is so obvious,'' Ms. Brown said, when ''there are no leaves to obscure the view.''
Not every plant is a candidate for amputation. Some have already formed flowering buds for the spring: fruit trees like apples and pears, roses, lilacs, forsythia. Spare these seasonal workers from cutbacks.
Ultimately, you may not be the only one who would like to spend the winter cosseted in a quilt. During a cold snap, consider wrapping a burlap coat around a rhododendron, a fig tree, or a bed of heather and heath. ''Some people put straw inside to make it even warmer,'' Ms. Brown said.
You'll find the rest of us -- callous, lazy, smart -- gazing out the kitchen window, waiting for spring.

Democrats in Senate Confront Doubts at Home on Gun Laws

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 1224 words

BECKLEY, W.Va. -- Talk of stricter gun control has stirred up a lot of unease here, a place where hunters vie for top prize (a 26-inch LED television) in the Big Buck Photo Contest, and ads for a gun-simulator game ask, ''Feel like shooting something today?''
But before Senator Joe Manchin III invited a group of 15 businessmen and community leaders to lunch last week to discuss the topic, he had only a vague idea of how anxious many of his supporters were.
''How many of you all believe that there is a movement to take away the Second Amendment?'' he asked. 
About half the hands in the room went up.
Despite his best attempts to reassure them -- ''I see no movement, no talk, no bills, no nothing'' -- they remained skeptical. ''We give up our rights one piece at a time,'' a banker named Charlie Houck told the senator.
If there is a path to new gun laws, it has to come through West Virginia and a dozen other states with Democratic senators like Mr. Manchin who are confronting galvanized constituencies that view any effort to tighten gun laws as an infringement.
As Congress considers what, if any, laws to change, Mr. Manchin has become a barometer among his colleagues, testing just how far they might be able to go without angering voters.
On Thursday a group of Democratic senators led by Dianne Feinstein of California plans to introduce a bill that would outlaw more than 100 different assault weapons, setting up what promises to be a fraught and divisive debate over gun control in Congress in the coming weeks. But a number of centrist lawmakers like Mr. Manchin have already thrown the measure's fate into question, saying that all they are willing to support for now is a stronger background check system.
As a hunter with an A rating from the National Rifle Association, Mr. Manchin gave advocates for new weapons laws reason for optimism after he said last month that gun firepower and magazine capacity might need to be limited.
But now, Mr. Manchin, who affirmed his support for gun rights by running a campaign commercial in 2010 showing him firing a rifle into an environmental bill, says he is not so sure. One of his local offices has been picketed, and even some of his most thoughtful supporters are cautioning him that stronger background checks are about all the gun control they can stomach.
And on the afternoon the 15 residents met with Mr. Manchin in the conference room of a local arts center, they told him that going after guns and ammunition capacity would be much like banning box cutters after the Sept. 11 attacks, or limiting whiskey and six-pack sales to cure alcoholism.
''It takes about a second and a half to change a clip,'' said Frank Jezioro, a former special agent with the Office of Naval Intelligence and now director of the state Division of Natural Resources.
Mr. Jezioro likened gunmen in mass shootings to suicide bombers: they will always find a way. ''A guy can walk through this door right here with your Beretta five-shot automatic, and cut the barrel off at 16 inches, and put five double-ought buckshots in there and kill everybody in here in a matter of seconds,'' he said. ''And you don't have to aim it.''
As it happened, there were at least two guns in the room. One was on the hip of a Beckley police detective who was invited to the lunch, the other at the side of the West Virginia state trooper who stood guard at the door.
Others at the lunch said that laws did little to help even the most violent societies. ''Mexico, for instance, has got some of the strictest gun control laws in North America,'' said Rick Johnson, the owner of a river expedition company. ''They'll put you in jail for a bullet in Mexico. And look how well it's worked.''
''I can take my A.R.,'' Mr. Johnson said, referring to his assault rifle, ''load it, put one in the chamber and throw it up on this table, and the only way it's going to hurt anybody is if I miss and hit someone in the head. The gun doesn't hurt anybody. It's the person pulling the trigger.''
After talking with the group for nearly two hours, Mr. Manchin left the meeting saying he was not at all comfortable with supporting the assault weapons ban favored by many of his colleagues in Congress.
''I'm not there,'' he said, adding that he was leaning toward strengthening screening gun purchases instead. ''I'm definitely more inclined to be very supportive of background checks.''
Mr. Manchin is just the beginning of gun control advocates' worries. Of far greater concern are Democrats who are up for re-election in 2014. Those include senators like Max Baucus of Montana, who was awarded an A+ rating from the N.R.A. Mr. Baucus has worded his comments on the subject carefully, bracketing them with gun rights-friendly language, like saying the ''culture of violence'' needs to be seriously examined along with any changes to the law.
There is Senator Mark Begich of Alaska, who has said flatly that he would not support a new assault weapons ban, and Senator Mark Udall of Colorado, who initially came out in support of the ban but has been more circumspect recently, saying in an interview last week that he would want to see the language of any such legislation first.
''I think for some of my colleagues, that's a tougher debate,'' Mr. Udall said of outlawing any individual weapons.
Senator Al Franken of Minnesota, one of the Senate's most reliable liberals, has not said definitively whether he would vote for the ban, instead signaling only his support for ''the principle'' of one.
For some, there is something else to consider in addition to voters who are fervently supportive of Second Amendment rights: jobs. North Carolina is where the rifle-maker Remington has its headquarters. One of the state's senators, Kay Hagan, is a Democrat also up for re-election next year.
Another is Senator Jean Shaheen of New Hampshire, who said she had been hearing from all corners of the state on the issue, including police chiefs, mothers with young children and people whose jobs are tied to local gunmakers like Sturm, Ruger & Company and Sig Sauer.
''Clearly they're going to be concerned about restrictions, because it's going to affect the sales they do,'' Ms. Shaheen said. ''But it seems to me there are places where we can come to an agreement.''
Those areas of agreement, she said, are the need for stronger background checks and better mental health care, not weapons bans.
Even before people on opposite sides of the gun control question start debating the merits of new laws, there are vast cultural divides that threaten to stand in the way of any compromise. In West Virginia, Mr. Manchin's constituents shook their heads at the mere mention of the term assault weapon, which they consider pejorative.
''Do you know where that phrase came from?'' said Roger Wilson, a river tour operator and an amateur gun historian. Its origin, he said, came from Hitler, who named a new German weapon Sturmgewehr, literally ''storm rifle,'' which in English became ''assault rifle.''
During the lunch, Mr. Manchin shared a recent conversation he had with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Obama administration's point person on gun control.
''I said, 'Mr. Vice President, with all due respect, I don't know how many people who truly believe that you would fight to protect their rights.' ''
The senator added, ''That's what we're dealing with.''

Bombing at a Funeral in Northern Iraq Kills at Least 35

BAGHDAD, Iraq -- A crowded tent full of Turkmen mourners in northern Iraq was transformed into a mass killing ground on Wednesday by a suicide bombing that left at least 35 people dead and 117 wounded, regional officials and tribal leaders said, calling it a genocidal attack meant to further stoke the already-inflamed sectarian tensions in the country. 
Both the dead and wounded victims included a number of high-ranking regional dignitaries, military officers, professors and religious men among the Turkmen population of the Tuz Khurmato district in Salahuddin Province, an area in the Kurdish north also claimed by Arabs and Turkmens. It came a day after an extended outbreak of sectarian shootings and bombings in the country that killed at least 24 Iraqis.
Mourners at the Imam Ali mosque had been paying their respects to a Turkmen employee of the Ministry of Health who had been killed in the mayhem the day before, the brother-in-law of a deputy in the Iraqi Turkmen Front, a political party. They had packed into a funeral tent for the ceremony when the suicide bomber, apparently masquerading as one of the aggrieved, blew himself up.
Turkmen leaders were outraged.
''We demand to have international forces to secure us, for the Turkmens and our areas,'' said Faid Alla, the head of a Turkmen tribe. ''We are being targeted, and our existence in Iraq is very dangerous, and we are under genocide. The central government is doing nothing for us.''
Tuz Khurmato, south of Kirkuk in an oil-rich area, was the site two months ago of a sectarian-tinged confrontation over disputed territory between forces loyal to the Iraqi government in Baghdad and the Kurdish regional government, which has its own armed forces.
Iraq has been increasingly consumed by sectarian attacks and political turmoil since December, when the home of the country's Sunni finance minister was raided by security forces loyal to Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, a Shiite. Mr. Maliki's political bloc has been accused by Sunnis and others of seeking to monopolize power before provincial elections this spring.
Mr. Maliki, who took power during the American-led military occupation of Iraq, has denied the accusations and rejected demands by rivals that he resign.
The instability has been a growing source of concern for the United States, which withdrew its military forces from Iraq about a year ago.

Honoring Drug War Dead, And Spurring a Debate

BYLINE: By RANDAL ARCHIBOLD; Karla Zabludovsky contributed reporting.

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; MEXICO CITY JOURNAL; Pg. 10

LENGTH: 1196 words

MEXICO CITY -- Reeling from a drug war that has killed tens of thousands and a boom in violent crime in general, Mexico has built a memorial to victims of violence. But like a crime scene still under investigation, it sits off limits behind white tarp, wrapped in questions and uncertainty.
A series of rusted metal slabs amid reflecting pools in a corner of Mexico City's biggest park, the memorial now stands as an accidental metaphor for the fog and doubts that swirl around the country's layered debates on violence and victimhood.
Rushed to completion by President Felipe Calderףn, whose six-year term was overwhelmed by the explosion of violence, the site has not yet publicly opened. On Nov. 30, in Mr. Calderףn's last 90 minutes in office, his administration sent a short e-mail to reporters announcing that the memorial was complete and in the hands of the civic groups that had called for it. 
But in fact the transfer of the military-owned site has been mired in bureaucratic delays, and there remains disagreement over who the victims are -- particularly in the bloody war against drug cartels and other organized crime that has consumed the country.
''We are fighting a war against an enemy we don't know,'' said Viridiana Rios, a Mexican researcher at Harvard University and former adviser to the Interior Ministry who is studying drug war deaths. ''We need to answer to the public. There are claims many of the victims are innocent. I would like to know if that is the case.''
Few debates in the country are as divisive or politically charged as that over the storm of violence in recent years, with mass shootings and bodies hung from bridges, evidently the work of cartels, but also other killings, violent robberies, kidnappings and extortion that may or may not be the work of organized crime.
A year ago, Mr. Calderףn's government released its last count of presumed drug-war dead -- 47,515 since the end of 2006 -- and then refused to release any further data, with his aides saying later that the count, dependent in part on reporting from state agencies, was not precise.
Mexican newspapers and academics have done their own counts and believe the figure surpasses 60,000. Most recently, the government released statistics for all homicides, drug-related or not, putting the figure at 102,705 in the past six years, just under half committed with guns.
What is certain is that violent crime often goes unpunished. Nearly 60 percent of the homicides remain unsolved, the Mexican census bureau said recently.
Mr. Calderףn's aides had long asserted that most drug war victims were involved in the trade or other criminal enterprises, judging by the earmarks of heavy weapons used or crime-ridden areas where they were found.
But victims' advocates note that many bodies, some dug up from common graves after perhaps years, remain unclaimed and unidentified, leaving the circumstances of their deaths a mystery. In addition to the known killings, some 25,000 people have been reported missing in the past six years. How many fell victim to violence is unknown.
A new law, stalled during Mr. Calderףn's term but enacted a little more than a month after Mr. Peסa Nieto took office on Dec. 1, aims to compile a more precise registry of crime victims and provide financial relief for their survivors, though critics contend the law does not clearly address who exactly a victim is or how the fund will be paid for.
The law and the memorial grew out of the emerging victims' rights movement, but reflect also the uncertainties of assigning guilt and innocence.
In this case, said Luis Vבzquez, a scholar at the Latin American School of Social Sciences in Mexico City, the split is between the middle and upper classes, which are concerned about crimes like kidnapping and extortion, and human rights groups, which are focused on abuses of the military and the police in the warlike attack on cartels.
''There are two groups and two discussions going on related to victims of crime,'' he said.
It follows that those two sides disagree on whom the memorial should honor. They even dispute who came up with the idea for it.
Javier Sicilia, a poet embraced by the left whose son was murdered by a drug gang in the south-central city of Cuernavaca in 2011, said he first proposed a memorial for drug-war victims at a security forum in November 2011 with Mr. Calderףn.
But another advocate for the memorial offers a different account. Isabel Miranda de Wallace, whose son was kidnapped for ransom in Mexico City in 2005 and never seen again, said she had long pushed for a memorial to all victims of violence and mentioned it to Mr. Calderףn a year earlier. She ran unsuccessfully for mayor of Mexico City last year as the candidate of Mr. Calderףn's right-leaning National Action Party, but says she is not a member of any party.
''I told him we have a lot of people in pain,'' said Ms. Wallace, now the memorial's biggest champion.
In the end, the administration agreed to provide nearly $2 million for the project and helped organize a monthlong contest among architects, who submitted 68 designs to a panel of judges from architectural schools and civic groups.
The designated site was a military parcel next to a parade ground in the city's enormous Chapultepec Park. That angered Mr. Sicilia and others who view the military's heavy-handed actions as abusive. ''As you can imagine, we see that as an insult to the dead, the suffering of victims, the pain of the country and historical memory,'' he said.
The winning design was led by Ricardo Lףpez Martםn and two other architects. Just off one of the city's main boulevards, its several dozen rusted slabs, set in a shady garden, evoke the passage of time and at night are illuminated from within. Some showcase quotations from the likes of Carlos Fuentes, Gabriel Garcםa Mבrquez and Anne Frank. Visitors can leave messages, too.
Ms. Wallace concedes the project got fast-tracked with the goal of dedicating it before Mr. Calderףn left office. Planned for a week before he stepped down, the ceremony failed to come to pass. However, two weeks before leaving office, Mr. Calderףn publicly dedicated a nearby memorial to fallen soldiers.
Now, Ms. Wallace said, the opening of the victims' memorial must wait until the paperwork transferring the property from military to civilian use is completed, possibly in February.
Mr. Calderףn, who begins teaching at Harvard this month and has been the subject of protests there, declined to comment through a spokeswoman. The office of his successor, Enrique Peסa Nieto, would not say if he would attend a dedication, acknowledging no date was set.
Some passers-by have no idea what is behind the white tarp in the park, and some who do frown on it as an unwelcome reminder of their country's troubles.
''I won't be bringing my daughter to see a monument to victims of violence,'' said Gabriel Ruiz, a publicist who passes the shrouded construction every day and believes most of the victims were involved in crime themselves.
Anibel Renteria, a secretary having lunch in the park, said, ''If this gives comfort to people who lost somebody, it seems fine to do, but I never would have had this idea.''

Seau's Family Files Suit Against the N.F.L.

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

SECTION: Section B; Column 0; Sports Desk; Pg. 12

LENGTH: 379 words

The family of Junior Seau, a former star linebacker who shot and killed himself last year, sued the N.F.L., the helmet maker Riddell and others on Wednesday, accusing them of hiding information about the link between head hits and long-term cognitive issues. 
The family said the league not only ''propagated the false myth that collisions of all kinds, including brutal and ferocious collisions, many of which lead to short-term and long-term neurological damage to players, are an acceptable, desired and natural consequence of the game,'' but also that ''the N.F.L. failed to disseminate to then-current and former N.F.L. players health information it possessed'' about the risks associated with brain trauma.
Seau's family, which filed the case in state court in San Diego, is seeking an unspecified amount of compensatory and punitive damages.
Seau was 43 when he shot himself in the chest at his home in California in May. He played 20 seasons in the N.F.L. with the San Diego Chargers, the Miami Dolphins and the New England Patriots. This month the National Institutes of Health said tissue samples from Seau's brain showed that he had chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated head hits and brain trauma.
''We were saddened to learn that Junior, a loving father and teammate, suffered from C.T.E.,'' Seau's family said in a statement after its complaint was filed. ''We know this lawsuit will not bring back Junior. But it will send a message that the N.F.L. needs to care for its former players, acknowledge its decades of deception on the issue of head injuries and player safety, and make the game safer for future generations.''
Greg Aiello, a spokesman for the N.F.L., said the league's lawyers would ''respond to the claims appropriately through the court.''
The N.F.L. has often asked courts to move these cases to federal court in Philadelphia, where similar complaints have been consolidated. More than 4,000 retired N.F.L. players and their family members, including those of Ray Easterling and Dave Duerson, who also committed suicide, have similar cases pending there.
The N.F.L. has asked that the cases be dismissed, arguing that the league's collective bargaining agreement with its players covers these issues.

Possible Second Suspect Sought in Houston Shooting

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 16

LENGTH: 603 words

HOUSTON -- Law enforcement officials said Wednesday that they had not recovered the pistol used in a shooting at a community college on Tuesday that left four people hospitalized, but that they had charged the student they say fired the shots and were still searching for a possible second suspect.
The shooting occurred at Lone Star College's North Harris campus, a 19,000-student community college about 30 minutes from downtown Houston. A dispute between two young men turned violent when one of them pulled a gun and fired at least 10 rounds, the authorities said. 
The man charged, Carlton Neal Berry Jr., 22, is accused of shooting Jody Neal, 25, outside the library shortly after noon, the authorities said. Mr. Neal was in the process of enrolling as a student; Mr. Berry, a student, has had several run-ins with the law since 2009.
Sheriff Adrian Garcia of Harris County said that investigators were still determining the exact nature of the dispute, but at a news conference Wednesday he described the matter as ''a ridiculous adolescent confrontation.''
Sheriff Garcia said officials believed that only one gun was used, but he did not have details about it, other than to say it was a pistol. He appealed to the public to call a tip line as the authorities continued to search for the weapon as well as another possible suspect, whose role in the episode remains unclear.
The shooting received widespread news coverage in Texas and throughout the country because of fears that a mass shooting was under way a month after the deadly school shooting in Newtown, Conn. But officials said that Mr. Berry was never an ''active shooter,'' and that he appeared to target only Mr. Neal.
A college maintenance worker who was shot, Bobby Cliburn, 55, was described by the authorities as a bystander.
''This situation that we confronted here, thank God, was nothing like Newtown, Conn.,'' said the sheriff, whose nephew is a student on the Lone Star campus. ''What we had here was idiocy, stupidity. We had individuals who did not care about putting other people in harm's way.''
The shooting sent four people to area hospitals: Mr. Berry, Mr. Neal, Mr. Cliburn and a woman who appeared to be a student and was not shot but had an anxiety attack. Mr. Neal was shot in the leg and the abdomen; none of those hospitalized had life-threatening injuries, officials said.
Mr. Berry has been charged with two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and remained under armed guard at a hospital. His previous criminal record, according to court documents, included an arrest on charges of misdemeanor theft in 2009 and two others on charges of misdemeanor marijuana possession in 2011 and 2012.
Students at the college returned to classes Wednesday, though a number of them opted to stay home. Stephen C. Head, the president of the North Harris campus, estimated that 5 percent of the student population was absent Wednesday.
Lone Star College System officials said they responded quickly to the shooting and followed their protocols in alerting students that a lockdown was in place via text messages, e-mail and other means. It appeared, however, that some students and faculty members did not receive notification in the minutes after the shooting.
The sheriff's office received the initial 911 call at 12:19 p.m.; the first notification of a campus lockdown on the college's Web site was posted at 12:52 p.m.
Mr. Head said a number of students were notified before 12:52 p.m. via text message, but added that the college was reviewing its handling of the shooting. ''We're still taking a look at the timing on that,'' he said.

Republican Myopia

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; EDITORIAL; Pg. 26

LENGTH: 460 words

Congressional Republicans like nothing more than beating a dead horse if it might embarrass the Obama administration -- like their unceasing attempt to accuse the administration of lying to the American people about the attack in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens. 
The allegations are specious, but that didn't stop some Republicans from repeating them on Wednesday during Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's Congressional testimony. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky was particularly out of control, rather absurdly comparing the scope of the Benghazi attack to the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
It's not clear what drives this obsession after the Republicans' failed attempt to derail President Obama's re-election over Benghazi. Is it the prospect, however vague it now is, that Mrs. Clinton might run for president in 2016?
Mrs. Clinton was professional and authoritative for hours in the witness chair before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and, later, the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. But she understandably reached her limit when Senator Ron Johnson pummeled her with the same questions Republicans have hammered at repeatedly since Mr. Stevens and his colleagues were killed in September. These have nothing to do with what happened, why and how to prevent a recurrence, but whether various statements -- especially by Susan Rice, the United States ambassador to the United Nations -- proved to be perfectly accurate.
''With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans,'' Mrs. Clinton said, her voice rising in anger. ''Was it because of a protest? Or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided they'd go and kill some Americans? What difference, at this point, does it make?''
She said, rightly, that in the days after the attack, officials were struggling in real time, under crisis conditions, to get the best information they could. What is essential now is to improve security, not keep rehashing the C.I.A.-authorized talking points that Ms. Rice delivered on the Sunday talk shows, she said.
There were, of course, serious questions raised, including how Democrats and Republicans need to approve sufficient funds to protect embassies and diplomats overseas. But there was also a fair amount of surreal behavior.
Mr. Paul asked about Mrs. Clinton's recent ill health in one breath and then in the next declared that, if he had been president, he would have fired her for Benghazi. Calling the killings the ''worst tragedy'' since Sept. 11 was insulting to the nearly 8,000 soldiers killed in Iraq and Afghanistan or the many hundreds of Americans killed in senseless gun violence each year. We know politicians are short on perspective, but some is required.

Anthony Shoots More As Knicks Win Less

BYLINE: By NATE TAYLOR

SECTION: Section B; Column 0; Sports Desk; Pg. 15

LENGTH: 619 words

GREENBURGH, N.Y. -- Carmelo Anthony's biggest responsibility is to ignite the Knicks' offense and be the team's most reliable point producer. He has fulfilled that assignment as the season approaches its midway point, leading the Knicks in scoring in 30 of the 32 games he has played.
That is the good news. Less encouraging is that Anthony is taking more shots per game than he did at the beginning of the season, when the Knicks surprised the N.B.A. by winning 11 of their first 15 games. 
In the past month, Anthony has become more of a volume scorer. He had 29 points on 29 field-goal attempts Monday against the Nets. I In November, by contrast, he aspired to be a pinpoint shooter with fewer than 25 attempts a game.
In 15 games in November, Anthony averaged 20.7 shots. In December, that figure increased to 23. This month, it has climbed to 25.5.
And too many of those shots are not going in -- either because he is being guarded more closely as the season progresses or because more of the shots are being forced. His shooting percentage this month is 41.7 percent, significantly lower than his season mark of 45.6 percent.
Too many shots by Anthony, and too many that hit off the rim, do not constitute a formula for success. The trend is also a reminder of past criticism of Anthony, when he has been portrayed as a player focused more on his offense than on integrating himself into a wider team strategy.
In this instance, though, Anthony would seem to have an explanation for shooting more. The Knicks have been without Raymond Felton, their starting point guard, for a month. Until Felton's injury, he was averaging 16.4 shots per game, the second most on the team. With Felton out, those shots have gone to other players.
So Anthony, whose shots were increasing before Felton was injured on Christmas, has taken even more with him out of the lineup. Anthony conceded he was controlling the offense more now but did not see many alternatives.
''I guess that's what they pay me to do, right?'' Anthony said at practice Tuesday. ''I go out there, try to have fun and do what I have to do to help the team win. If it's shoot the ball more, rebounding more, passing the ball more, I'm all for it.''
For now, it appears Anthony does have to shoot a lot to keep the Knicks in games, although that approach is not necessarily producing victories. Anthony took 26 or more shots in three of the Knicks' last four losses. He was suspended for the other defeat, which came against Indiana.
Coach Mike Woodson said he did not have a problem with Anthony's shot totals.
''He's been hovering around 30 points a game, so he's doing his part,'' Woodson said. ''Some of the shots he's taken have been good shots, and he's taken some bad ones. But I don't find too many shots that Carmelo takes that are bad shots.''
Woodson had Anthony do a lot against the Nets in Monday's loss at Madison Square Garden. On numerous possessions, the Knicks threw the ball to him and watched him try to score over multiple defenders. He played more like a point guard and even ran pick-and-rolls with Tyson Chandler.
Anthony's fourth quarter proved disappointing. He missed all six of his shots and committed three fouls. His last shot, which came with the Knicks trailing, 85-84, was an air ball with 12 seconds left. The Nets won, 88-85.
Compare that game with one much earlier in the season, on Nov. 15, when the Knicks rallied against San Antonio on the road. Anthony did not try a single shot in the fourth quarter, and the Knicks stunned the Spurs over the final seven minutes with a 27-11 run to win, 104-100.
But that was when the Knicks were undefeated. Now reality has set in, as well as a trend that could lead to problems in the long run.

A shooting at a Houston-area community college that wounded three people on Tuesday erupted when two men argued after bumping into each other, according to court documents released Thursday. One suspect, Carlton Berry, 22, was arrested on a charge of aggravated assault the day of the shooting at Lone Star College, and a second was charged the next day. Although officials declined to name the second suspect, a probable cause affidavit identified him as Trey Foster, 22. He has not yet been arrested. The affidavit said an argument ensued when a third man bumped into Mr. Foster. The three parted ways, but later saw one another, and shots were fired.

Two of the most wanted Islamist rebels in Chechnya were among 14 people killed in a shootout between Russian forces and militants, the news agency Interfax said Thursday. The two men, Khuseyn and Muslim Gakayev, were brothers who have been accused of organizing several high-profile attacks. Insurgents seeking a separate Islamist state still stage regular attacks across the broader North Caucasus region more than a decade after Russia re-established federal control over Chechnya following two separatist wars.

When the Bullets Flew, 'They Didn't Care That I Was a Woman'

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 1142 words

During her second deployment to Iraq, Staff Sgt. Stacy Pearsall of the Air Force found herself attached to an Army ground unit that was clearing roadside bombs. They had just found their 26th device of the day when one of their armored personnel carriers exploded. An ambush was on.
The chaos that unfolded over the next few hours was not a typical day for Sergeant Pearsall. But under the Pentagon's decision to allow women into front-line combat units, officially announced Thursday, it could become much closer to the norm for women in American uniforms.
As Sergeant Pearsall tells the story, her vehicle came under intense fire that day in 2007, near the city of Baquba. The male soldiers in her carrier had already dashed out to join the fight, so she jumped onto the machine gun and began returning fire. 
Outside a soldier lay unconscious. Sergeant Pearsall opened the rear door and crawled to the man, who was 6-foot-2 and more than 200 pounds, twice her weight. From behind him, she clasped him in a bear hug and dragged him toward the vehicle. She fell once, then again. Somehow, she hauled him into the armored safety of the carrier.
After tearing off his protective vest, she realized his carotid artery had been torn by shrapnel. As blood spurted all over, she closed her eyes, stuck her fingers into his neck and squeezed. He screamed, and she thanked the heavens. He was still kicking.
What happened next seemed almost cinematic. Emerging from a purplish haze outside, a medic jumped into the carrier and set his kit beside her. ''Are you a medic?'' he asked.
Heck no, Sergeant Pearsall replied. ''I'm the photographer.''
The question that now looms over the Pentagon as it moves toward full gender integration is whether female service members like Sergeant Pearsall, for all their bravery under fire, can perform the same dangerous and physically demanding tasks day in and day out, for weeks at a time, as permanent members of ground combat units like the infantry or armored cavalry.
Since 1994, women have technically been barred from serving in those front-line units. But throughout the post-9/11 wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, women -- working as medics, intelligence officers, photographers, military police officers and in a host of other jobs -- have been routinely ''attached'' to all-male ground combat units, where they have come under fire, returned fire, been wounded and been killed.
To supporters of Secretary of Defense Leon E. Panetta's decision to rescind the prohibition on women in combat, the experiences of those women proved that the distinction between being ''attached'' to a combat unit and actually serving in one was outdated, and pointless.
''When the military goes to full integration, it allows commanders to put the best person in the job, not just the best man,'' said Greg Jacob, a former Marine Corps officer who is now policy director for the Service Women's Action Network, an advocacy group for women in the military. ''If the best shot in the platoon is a woman, I can make her a sniper. But until now, I couldn't do that.''
But to skeptics of the policy change, it is one thing for women to perform well when they come under fire while temporarily attached to all-male combat units. It is a far different thing, they argue, to carry out the daily mission of hunting down and engaging enemy forces as an infantry soldier or tank commander.
Representative Duncan Hunter, Republican of California and a Marine Corps veteran with combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, defines it as a difference between ''incidental combat,'' as women have faced in convoys or attacks on bases, and ''the direct combat duties of our advanced and most elite ground operators.''
Representative Hunter said in a statement, ''The question here is whether this change will actually make our military better at operating in combat, specifically finding and targeting the enemy.''
Ask Sergeant Pearsall, who was decorated for her actions in Baquba and received a medical retirement from the Air Force in 2008, and the answer is simple: Yes, women can do it, and I already have.
During her four-month Iraq tour in 2007 -- cut short by injuries -- she went on patrols almost daily, wearing the same heavy body armor and Kevlar helmet as the men, while lugging camera equipment. She, too, came under fire. She, too, fired back. She, too, saw friends die.
''I didn't sit around thinking: 'I'm a woman, I don't think I can carry this gun,' '' she said. ''And I can't speak for the men, but I feel that when the bullets were flying, they didn't care that I was a woman, as long as I was pulling the trigger.''
She added: ''I contributed to the team effort. If I can do that, that's all that matters.''
The armed services are now developing gender-neutral standards for all of their jobs, and the Pentagon has vowed that those standards will not be lowered to make it easier for women to join combat units.
At present, the Army, for instance, allows women to pass their physical fitness tests with fewer push-ups and a slower two-mile run, than men.
Will women be able to meet a new, single standard? Kristen Rouse, a first lieutenant in the New York Army National Guard who just returned from her third deployment to Afghanistan, said that she was confident they could.
''In my fitness test, I always pass by the standards of a male of my equivalent age,'' she said. ''And I'm not an athlete. The physical demands are not insurmountable.''
Mr. Jacob, who was a training company commander for both male and female Marine recruits, said the key would be to make women systematically train to the higher standards. When the Corps has done that -- by requiring women to do more pull-ups or longer ruck marches -- they consistently succeeded, he said. And at the same time, better training has reduced weight-bearing injuries to backs and hips -- major concern among female troops, he said.
Like many female service members, Ms. Rouse, who always wanted to serve in a tank unit, said she believed lifting the prohibition would help women climb higher on the military career ladder.
''There is prestige there, when you can say, 'I got to work with the Afghan Army,' or 'I was with a unit in multiple firefights,' '' she said. ''There is a lot more prestige there than if you say, 'Hey I spent the last nine months shipping equipment from Bagram.' ''
But Stacy Pearsall, 33, who now owns a photography school in Charleston, S.C., said she hoped the policy change would do something else as well: Give women more credibility with their commanders and health care providers when they return from war with physical injuries or mental health problems.
She says she had trouble convincing people that she had sustained brain and neck injuries in Iraq because of combat. ''People just assumed I was not injured in combat, because I had not been in a combat unit,'' she said.

Women in the Battlefield

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; EDITORIAL; Pg. 26

LENGTH: 571 words

The Pentagon's decision to end its ban on women in combat is a triumph for equality and common sense. By opening infantry, artillery and other battlefield jobs to all qualified service members regardless of sex, the military is showing that categorical discrimination has no place in a society that honors fairness and equal opportunity.
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, who overturned the ban this week, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who unanimously urged him to do it, deserve praise for bringing military policy in line with reality. Women have been in the thick of combat in Iraq and Afghanistan for more than a decade. More than 280,000 have been deployed there, thousands have been injured and more than 150 killed. With the rule abolished, such service and sacrifice will no longer be unofficial and unrecognized. 
It is encouraging that the push for change came from the top, from leaders who said integration was no bar to a stronger, better military. The Pentagon also was facing pressure from lawsuits, including one brought last November on behalf of four service women and the Service Women's Action Network, an advocacy group, claiming that gender-based discrimination was unconstitutional and unfairly harmed their careers.
One plaintiff, Maj. Mary Jennings Hegar, an Air National Guard helicopter pilot who was shot down and wounded in Afghanistan, said she could not seek combat leadership positions because, in the Pentagon's view, she had not officially seen combat. Major Hegar is only one of untold thousands of women whose career paths have been sharply limited by that gap in their rיsumיs.
When the new policy is fully in place, we hope many more women will apply for jobs that they wouldn't have considered, in certain schools, leadership courses and in those branches of service -- namely the Army and Marine Corps -- where their opportunities have been most proscribed. The result will be more diversity, from a deeper pool of talent, and thus a stronger, better military.
There will also be grumbling. When the news broke Wednesday afternoon, military news sites like Army Times and Marine Corps Times lit up with comments, some ranging from laughably sexist to reprehensible. ''They shouldn't be bused in from the field every 3 days for a shower while the guys stay out for 45 days,'' said one commenter. ''The castration of the U.S. Army continues,'' said another. ''God help us all.''
Some right-wing commentators rehashed false stereotypes that women couldn't hack it, and warned that women would be captured and raped and men would get shot trying to protect them instead of killing the enemy. These lurid hypotheticals deny the reality that military women face far greater danger of sexual assault and harassment from their fellow troops -- a crisis that the Pentagon has slowly been addressing, and that full combat integration should help to remedy. Adding women to the leadership corps will foster a healthier military culture freed from testosterone-soaked abuse and scandal.
Many in the military already understand that many women can do combat jobs as well as men, if not better, but none have the chance to prove it. ''Fully support,'' one Army Times commenter wrote of the new policy, ''as long as the training and the physical standards for such positions remain what they need to be to accomplish the mission and make every team member able to provide support and cover for their teammates.''

Aurora's Suffering Beyond the Spotlight

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; EDITORIAL OBSERVER; Pg. 26

LENGTH: 538 words

The cinema complex in Aurora, Colo., reopened last week, six months after a gunman killed 12 patrons, wounded 58 and left deep scars on a community still struggling to recover. ''Everyone heals, some slower, some in different ways,'' contended Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado in the face of angry complaints from some of the victims' families that the reopening, with prayers, a ''night of remembrance'' and a screening of ''The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,'' was insensitive and crass.
His point about the certainty of healing, while undoubtedly heartfelt, is too often and too easily offered by political leaders when, in fact, Aurora, like Newtown, Conn., and countless other places savaged by multiple shootings across decades, must struggle for years with the legacy and its wounds, largely alone as the spotlight fades. The trials of gun-damaged victims who survive mass assaults is one of the intangibles that must not be overlooked if the nation, and the political system, is to have any hope in the renewed fight for stronger gun controls. 
For all the talk at the movie house of healing, one surviving victim, 23-year-old Caleb Medley, remained in grievous suffering on his back with severe brain and motor damage and the loss of an eye. His family exulted when he was briefly helped to his feet last month, and hoped that he might be able to leave rehabilitation soon for an extended care facility, however limited his horizons. Seven family members of another victim, Ashley Moser, take turns making sure the 25-year-old woman, a paraplegic after a neck wound, is rotated twice a night in her bed. Her aunt, Annie Dalton, reports Ashley remains deeply depressed with little motivation as she faces the fact that her 6-year-old daughter, Veronica, was shot dead that night while the paralyzed mother lost a fetus soon after the gun spree.
''There is no closure here,'' Ms. Dalton, a retired public school principal, politely reported of Ashley's life. ''It's a tough road,'' she said, citing all manner of bureaucratic tangles about health insurance, fading rehabilitation coverage, other financial demands beyond estimating, and endless tasks like the family's learning to move Ashley on a board to distant doctors' appointments.
There is familiar ritual in Aurora's aftermath that the rest of the nation needs to know. A charity fund that grew so quickly after the carnage -- to about $5 million -- is depleted. It was distributed by Ken Feinberg, the respected compensation guru from 9/11 and other tragedies, under a formula that devotes 70 percent to those who suffered brain damage or paralysis -- something more than $200,000 each. ''There's not enough money,'' Mr. Feinberg apologized to claimants with lower-rated trauma. ''It's a horrible situation,'' he said of Aurora's needs.
In caring for her niece, Ms. Dalton can barely speak of the fresh massacre in Newtown or the ''unreal'' power of the National Rifle Association in dominating the conversation about a problem that in the last 40 years has taken one million lives and left countless others like Ashley and her family to manage unspeakably debilitated lives. ''The next tragedy is on its way,'' Ms. Dalton said of the one certain lesson in Ashley's fate.

Senator Unveils Bill to Limit Semiautomatic Arms

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER; Peter Baker contributed reporting.

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 15

LENGTH: 883 words

WASHINGTON -- During a lengthy and at times emotionally wrenching news conference, Senator Dianne Feinstein of California on Thursday announced legislation that would ban the sale and manufacture of 157 types of semiautomatic weapons, as well as magazines holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition.
The bill, which Ms. Feinstein introduced in the Senate later in the afternoon, would exempt firearms used for hunting and would grandfather in certain guns and magazines. The goal of the bill, she said, is ''to dry up the supply of these weapons over time.'' 
Surrounded by victims of gun violence, colleagues in the Senate and House and several law enforcement officials, and standing near pegboards with several large guns attached, Ms. Feinstein acknowledged the difficulty in pursuing such legislation, even when harnessing the shock and grief over the shooting of 20 schoolchildren in Newtown, Conn., last month. ''This is really an uphill road,'' Ms. Feinstein said.
Since the expiration of a ban on assault weapons in 2004, lawmakers have been deeply reluctant to revisit the issue. They cite both a lack of evidence that the ban was effective and a fear of the gun lobby, which has made significant inroads at the state and federal levels over the past decade in increasing gun rights.
Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, recently said that he was skeptical about the bill. Ms. Feinstein immediately called him to express her displeasure with his remarks.
Many lawmakers, including some Democrats, prefer more modest measures to curb gun violence, like enhanced background checks of gun buyers or better enforcement of existing laws.
One such measure has been introduced by Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who will begin hearings next week on gun violence. Among the witnesses will be Wayne LaPierre, the chief executive of the National Rifle Association.
''Senator Feinstein has been trying to ban guns from law-abiding citizens for decades,'' said Andrew Arulanandam, a spokesman for Mr. LaPierre. ''It's disappointing but not surprising that she is once again focused on curtailing the Constitution instead of prosecuting criminals or fixing our broken mental health system.''
More legislation is expected to arise over the next week or two, and some of it will have bipartisan support. Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, and Senator Mark Kirk, Republican of Illinois, have agreed to work together on gun trafficking legislation that would seek to crack down on illegal guns. Currently, federal law does not define gun trafficking as a crime.
Mr. Kirk is also working on a background check proposal with Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, who is considered somewhat of a bellwether among Democrats with strong gun-rights records.
Mr. Leahy's bill would give law enforcement officials more tools to investigate so-called straw purchasing of guns, in which people buy a firearm for others who are prohibited from obtaining one on their own.
Ms. Feinstein was joined on Thursday by several other lawmakers, including Representative Carolyn McCarthy of New York, who will introduce companion legislation in the House, and Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, who emotionally recalled the day when the children and adults were gunned down in Newtown. ''I will never forget the sight and the sounds of parents that day,'' he said. Several gun violence victims, relatives of those killed and others gave brief statements of support for the bill.
Ms. Feinstein's bill -- which, unlike the 1994 assault weapons ban, would not expire after being enacted -- would also ban certain characteristics of guns that make them more lethal. More than 900 models of guns would be exempt for hunting and sporting.
Such a measure is vehemently opposed by the N.R.A. and many Republican lawmakers, as well as some Democrats. ''I don't think you should have restrictions on clips,'' said Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, who has said he welcomes a Senate debate on guns. ''The Second Amendment wasn't written so you can go hunting, it was to create a force to balance a tyrannical force here.''
Proponents of the ban argue that in spite of claims to the contrary, the 1994 measure, of which Ms. Feinstein was a chief sponsor, helped curb gun violence. ''The original bill, though flawed, had a definite impact on the number of these weapons faced by the police on streets and used in crimes,'' said Adam Eisgrau, who helped write the 1994 ban while serving as Judiciary Committee counsel to Ms. Feinstein. The new bill, with more explicit language on the types of features on banned weapons, ''is far more respectful of firearms for recreation uses,'' he said.
Bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines were among the proposals unveiled by President Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. last week. Mr. Biden took the campaign for tougher gun laws to the Internet on Thursday in an online video chat that was part of an effort by the White House to build public support for its guns package. Mr. Biden, who developed the plans embraced by Mr. Obama, will host a round-table event in Richmond, Va., on Friday, and officials have said that Mr. Obama will travel at some point to promote the package.

Azerbaijan: Riot Quelled, Officials Say

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROTH and SHAHLA SULTANOVA; Andrew Roth reported from Moscow, and Shahla Sultanova from Ismayilli, Azerbaijan.

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 5

LENGTH: 621 words

MOSCOW -- Officials of the ruling party in Azerbaijan said on Friday that the police had restored order in the city of Ismayilli after two days of rioting and calls for the local governor to resign. Local residents, however, said the police were still making arrests and the city remained on the brink of martial law.
The episode began late Wednesday night as a brawl over a traffic accident in Ismayilli, a resort town about 100 miles west of the country's capital, Baku. But it quickly transformed into a volatile political protest, as a mob of several thousand burned down a hotel, then set siege to a regional official's house. 
On Thursday, a combined force of local and national police officers used water cannons, rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse the crowd. The police refused on Friday to say how many arrests had been made, but local news reports said at least 50 people had been detained.
The protest was a rare explosion of uncontrolled frustration in Azerbaijan, an oil-producing country on the Caspian Sea, where politics are dominated by President Ilham Aliyev, and even relatively small street demonstrations often prompt heavy-handed responses from riot police officers.
Mubaiz Gurbanli, deputy chairman of the majority New Azerbaijan Party, sought to downplay the significance of the riots in an interview on Friday.
''This was not a revolt,'' he said, adding that the protests were driven by ''emotional'' young men. ''This was a local incident and that does not reflect the situation in the whole of Azerbaijan.''
Residents of Ismayilli said they were fed up with cronyism among regional officials and growing income inequality between locals and businessmen from the capital.
''Half of Ismayilli belongs to the governor and his family, they do whatever they want,'' said Leyla, 22, in a telephone interview from the city where her family owns a business.
''The city is full of military,'' she said. ''It is like Ismayilli is at war.''
The rioting began late Wednesday evening after Emil Shamsaddinov, a businessman from Baku who owns a hotel in the city, and another man attacked a local taxi driver after a traffic accident, the police said.
A crowd of several thousand residents quickly formed in support of the taxi driver and set fire to Mr. Shamsaddinov's hotel, which was also rumored to house a brothel belonging to the regional governor, Nizami Alekperov.
Later, the crowd burned several motorcycles outside the home of Mr. Alekperov's son. One protester said the crowd stopped short of burning down the residence only because it had run out of gasoline.
The following day, hundreds of protesters regrouped near the governor's house, and video taken by local media showed police officers using armored vehicles with water cannons as well as shooting canisters of gas and rubber bullets into the crowd.
The melee carried echoes of a 2012 protest after a regional governor called his constituents ''sellouts'' in a televised interview. Thousands of protesters surrounded the official's home, and in a rare concession, the official was forced to step down.
By contrast, Mr. Alekperov told journalists on Thursday that he would not resign. ''One cannot politicize a conflict between two people over an automobile accident,'' he said.
Irana Abdullayeva, 20, said she traveled to Ismayilli after learning that a cousin, Jeyhun, had been arrested. In a telephone interview from the jail where her cousin was being held, she said the police had barred relatives from carrying in cellphones to prevent audio or video recordings.
''I hear weird screams,'' she said. ''It seems that they are being beaten. Also, I hear them being cursed at.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

The Toll of Grief and a Crusade Against Guns

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; CITY ROOM; Pg. 17

LENGTH: 737 words

"FOR SALE BY OWNER" declares a sign on the porch of Al Valentin's house on Ellis Avenue in the Bronx. Inside the spotless brick home, he shows off the place like the seasoned real estate pro that he is. Soft light. Solid floors. And not only one basement level, but two - and all done according to code. In the back, where a pool once was, a barbecue pit.
"I was doing pretty well before," said Mr. Valentin, 69, who at one time had an office on Castle Hill Avenue where more than a dozen brokers and salespeople worked for him. "I wanted to make my home look like Long Island, but in the Bronx. I did all this before my son died. Then I lost my desire." 
A portrait of that boy on the verge of manhood hangs on the living room wall. Below it, his diploma from Iona Prep, dated 1995. It's an honorary one. He was killed right before starting his senior year, when an argument over a girl turned deadly, and he was shot to death along with his friend Heith Simmonds. He was 17.
The memory never goes away. And in recent months, it has been ever more vivid after the Newtown shootings and the debate on strengthening state and federal gun laws. For years after his son's 1994 murder, Mr. Valentin was active with New Yorkers Against Gun Violence and other groups working for stricter laws. He is glad New York State passed tougher laws - finally.
But his advocacy work, at news conferences, marches and lobbying sessions, took a toll on him, too. And he wonders if the public, despite their initial outrage at the murder of innocents, realizes the price.
"It's hard to be an advocate," he said. "You have to support them. The problem is that people get motivated for a while, and then they forget after a few months. And the other problem is people don't think it will happen to them."
Whatever illusion he had of that was shattered on Aug. 8, 1994. Looking for a way to channel his grief, he threw himself into the role of advocate. It felt good, he said, to glean some meaning from his son Derek's death. But it got harder over the years, when politicians dodged the hard questions he and others raised about a society that was awash in guns and blood.
"I started getting emotional again," Mr. Valentin said. "I started to feel the pain all over again. When you do so much and don't see results, it affects you."
Not just emotionally, but financially. Having spent so much time on gun control, he had neglected his business. Realizing retirement was on the horizon - as well as wanting to provide for his grandchildren - he got back into selling real estate.
Not that Mr. Valentin has forsaken his crusade. He was encouraged by the passage of the New York law. But he remains doubtful about any real change on the federal level. The National Rifle Association, he said, has too much sway over politicians, even though he doesn't think the group is as tough as it would like people to think. His advice: whenever an episode of gun violence happens, call your elected officials. (He knows the numbers of everyone from his state senator to the White House.)
"To combat the N.R.A., people have to have their politician's phone numbers," he said. "If they hear enough voices, they won't be afraid to act."
The Newtown shooting may shock. But then what?
"Because of the ages of the kids, it hit a sore spot with people to do something," he said. "We may make progress. But it will happen again."
Around the very time he was saying that on Tuesday, three people were wounded in a shooting at a Houston college. Inside the Valentin home, it was quiet, His wife, Nellie, was in the kitchen, reading on her iPad. When asked how old Derek would have been, Mr. Valentin shouted out to his wife.
"Thirty six," she replied. "How the years pass. Oh my God, the kids catch up with the parents. He's going to be 36."
Going. Not would have been. Ever present.
The For Sale sign is a nod to her. Ms. Valentin would like to move to Florida to be near their two other children. Mr. Valentin prefers the Bronx. He likes the change of seasons. Besides, Derek is buried only minutes away at Saint Raymond's Cemetery. The Valentins go there often - usually every Sunday after Mass, and even when they're in the neighborhood running errands.
"I drop by, say a prayer and keep on," he said. "You know, if we move to Florida, we're taking him with us. They have a beautiful cemetery there."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Deadly Riots Erupt Across Egypt on Anniversary of Revolution

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK; Mayy El Sheikh contributed from Cairo.

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 4

LENGTH: 1083 words

CAIRO -- Violence erupted across Egypt on Friday as tens of thousands of demonstrators filled Tahrir Square to mark the second anniversary of the country's revolution with an outpouring of rage against the rise to power of the Muslim Brotherhood. At least seven protesters and two police officers were killed in clashes in Suez, the state news media said.
More than 250 people were injured in similar battles around government buildings across the country, including the Interior Ministry, the presidential palace and the state television building in the capital. The deaths reported in Suez took place near the provincial government headquarters, which protesters set on fire. 
The Egyptian military deployed armored vehicles in Suez on Saturday to restore security, several news organizations reported. On Friday, Muslim Brotherhood offices were ransacked or burned in at least three cities, including Ismailia, the Suez Canal town where the group was founded 85 years ago.
In the most striking episode, masked men attacked the offices of the Brotherhood's Web site in Cairo, upending furniture, littering the floor with broken glass and papers and smashing computers. Several witnesses said the assailants came in a large group to the third floor, carrying pellet guns and acid to burn through the padlock, and left with computer hard drives.
''They said, 'We are here to destroy this place,' '' said Ragab Abdel Hamid, 36, a printer who works for a liberal organization in the same building and tried to contain the attack. ''It was planned.'' Unknown assailants had blasted the metal doors to the same office with a fire bomb just days before, leaving flame marks, and the gates had been refortified.
The violence -- from Alexandria in the north to Aswan in the south -- dramatized the deepening chasm of animosity and distrust dividing the Brotherhood from its opponents. Although the Islamists of the Brotherhood have dominated elections since the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak in 2011, another broad segment of the population harbors deep suspicions of the group's conservative ideology, hierarchical structure and insular ethos.
Those doubts were only redoubled last month when President Mohamed Morsi, with the Brotherhood's political party, temporarily overruled the authority of the judiciary in order to ensure that his Islamist allies could push through an Islamist-backed Constitution to referendum over the objections of other parties and the Coptic Church.
''Egyptians will never let the Muslim Brotherhood rule -- over our dead bodies,'' said Heba Samir, 36, catching her breath by the Nile after fleeing tear gas outside the state television building.
In scenes reminiscent of the 18-day revolt two years ago, the chaos demonstrated more clearly than ever that Mr. Morsi and his allies have inherited not only the presidential palace but also the blame for Egypt's myriad problems. Five months after Mr. Morsi took power from Egypt's interim military rulers, many demonstrators said they had returned to Tahrir Square on Friday because they blamed the Brotherhood for failing to fulfill the demands of 2011: ''bread, freedom and social justice,'' as the chants went at the time.
But instead of uplifting the society, the revolution has brought two years of turmoil and a near-collapse of the economy. The Constitution that the Brotherhood pushed to a referendum last month deeply divided the country, with opponents complaining it fails to protect individual liberties. In Tahrir Square on Friday, banners demanded the fall of the ''Brotherhood Constitution.''
''The Egyptian people had so many dreams and the reality on the ground is, everything is still the same,'' said Mohamed Adl, 41, a teacher who carried a sign with a handwritten poem accusing the Brotherhood of making ''injustice the guard of our lives.''
Leaders of the Brotherhood, hoping to avoid the kind of factional clashes that killed 10 people in December, urged supporters to stay away from the square. The group observed the anniversary by organizing community service projects across the country, such as cleaning streets, painting public buildings, or providing discounted produce in poor neighborhoods. Critics said the efforts would also build good will among voters ahead of the parliamentary elections expected in April.
Brotherhood leaders initially welcomed the protests as proof that the revolution had won the right to freedom of expression. But shortly after 1 a.m. on Saturday, Mr. Morsi issued a series of short messages on his official Twitter account expressing his condolences for the victims killed in the ''repugnant violence.'' He called on Egyptians to express their views peacefully; insisted that the security force ''will exert its best effort to protect and secure'' protests; and pledged to ''chase criminals and bring them to justice.''
The violence began Thursday in Cairo. In anticipation of the anniversary, protesters began dismantling concrete barriers that had been erected around the Interior Ministry building to contain earlier demonstrations. The security forces began firing tear gas to stop them, and more than two dozen people were injured in intermittent battles that lasted through the night.
By early Friday afternoon in Cairo, protesters at one corner of Tahrir Square -- many of them apparently teenagers -- had begun scaling the barriers to throw rocks at the security forces massed around the ministry building. And the officers, as they typically do, threw rocks back, and plumes of tear gas rose overhead past a church steeple up the street. As the volleys escalated, a few canisters landed inside a makeshift field hospital in the church, flooding the clinic with choking fumes.
Osama Amir, 22, a student leaving that fight, said he did not know how it started or why. ''People have lost confidence in the central security forces, so when there is a chance to beat them up, we will beat them up,'' he said.
After dark, the battles of rocks, pellet guns and gas bombs had spread. Smoke from trash fires filled Tahrir Square.
Many protesters argued thatthe Brotherhood had forfeited its legitimacy. ''The big lie is that the Muslim Brotherhood is the majority,'' said May Ramadan, 37, an employee of the American University in Cairo. ''They are not, they are fascists, and they are liars.''
Mohamed Animer, 40, a communications engineer standing with her at the television building, said, ''We need to make more chaos, so the army will step in and take us back to square one.''

Deadly Turn in Protests Against Iraqi Leadership

BAGHDAD -- At least seven protesters and two soldiers were killed Friday in clashes that started after Iraqi Army forces opened fire on demonstrators who had pelted them with rocks on the outskirts of Falluja, west of Baghdad. It was the first deadly confrontation in more than a month of antigovernment protests by mostly Sunni opponents of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki.
As a result, a curfew was imposed on Falluja on Friday evening. 
A security official said one clash started when protesters began throwing rocks at government forces at a checkpoint near a main highway. The forces opened fire, and demonstrators responded by burning army vehicles and two cars, one belonging to a lawmaker from the mainly Sunni Iraqiya bloc and the other to a local politician from Anbar Province, where Falluja is located. Seven civilians were killed and 44 people were wounded, according to medical sources.
Videos posted online by the Iraqi Spring Media Center show a man being treated in the main Falluja hospital and people trudging across open tracts of land with little cover from the intense rounds of gunfire.
Later, unidentified gunmen killed two soldiers and wounded one at an army checkpoint south of Falluja in apparent retaliation, and gunmen kidnapped three soldiers, a police official said.
The Iraqi Defense Ministry later broadcast a statement saying it would investigate and punish those responsible for the gunfire, while compensating the people who were harmed.
''Today a group of people attacked one of the checkpoints of the army in Falluja,'' Mr. Maliki said in a statement, his first comments on the confrontation. ''They started it with stones and, after that, gunfire, which was what led to increasing the tension.''
He called on security forces to avoid force and said protesters had the right to demonstrate, but he also warned them to resist the incitement of what he called the ''conspiracies'' of regional intelligence agencies, remnants of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, the former government and groups with sectarian agendas.
''I call the wise people of Anbar to move toward turning off the fire of a sectarian strife that neither Anbar nor Iraq will benefit from,'' Mr. Maliki said.
Jaber al-Jaberi, a member of the Iraqiya bloc, asserted that it was the Iraqi Army that had provoked the confrontation.
''We have decided to stop all negotiations with the Maliki government,'' he said in a telephone interview from Baghdad, adding that the Iraqiya Party was asking the Shiite bloc to present a new candidate for prime minister.
''The United States sacrificed to build an Iraqi Army that is supposed to protect Iraq, not kill Iraqi people who ask for their rights,'' Mr. Jaberi said.
In Washington, the clash provoked concerns among experts on Iraq, who worried that it might lead to an escalation of sectarian violence. After the episode, officials at the State Department and the National Security Council made a round of calls to Iraqi officials urging restraint and recommending that talks between Mr. Maliki and his critics on power-sharing and other thorny issues continue. ''We are urging them to show maximum flexibility,'' an American official said.
Sectarian unrest and political tension have been worsening since December, when security forces loyal to Mr. Maliki, a Shiite, raided the home of the country's Sunni finance minister.
The raid revived accusations by Sunnis and others that Mr. Maliki and his political bloc were seeking to monopolize power before provincial elections in April. Mr. Maliki, who became prime minister during the American-led military occupation of Iraq, has denied the accusations and rejected demands to resign.
Protests have been seething since then, mostly intensifying on Fridays, when the week's largest communal prayer sessions are held, inspiring what are now known as No Retreat Fridays. There were also demonstrations in Nineveh, Salahuddin, Diyala and Kirkuk Provinces calling for government reforms.
''The army must get out of Anbar now and leave it to the police forces, because the people are very angry about the direct gunfire from the army toward the peaceful protesters,'' said a local religious leader, Imam Ahmed Deri, who was at the demonstration in Falluja.
''We will continue protesting, and this will give us more strength to face any kind of force,'' he added. While warning about the potential for retaliation from protesters angered over the shooting, he added, ''We will do our best to keep it peaceful.''
One of the protesters, Muhammed Abdula, said: ''This army is not wanted here anymore. We will not allow them in anymore; we are peaceful protesters. The army must protect us, not attack us. Is this the democracy that Maliki talks about? We give them words and they give us gunfire?''
In Nineveh, thousands of protesters called on the government to step down.
''Today we protest in Mosul; tomorrow we take the streets of Baghdad,'' they shouted.
But in Firdos Square in Baghdad, where United States forces orchestrated the toppling of Saddam Hussein's statue in 2003, hundreds gathered to support Mr. Maliki's government and to demand that efforts be made to prevent the return of Baathist leaders like Mr. Hussein to power.

In Fight Over Life, A New Call By Catholics

BYLINE: By LAURIE GOODSTEIN

LENGTH: 848 words

The March for Life in Washington on Friday renewed the annual impassioned call to end legalized abortion, 40 years after the Roe v. Wade decision. But this year, some Roman Catholic leaders and theologians are asking why so many of those who call themselves ''pro-life'' have been silent, or even opposed, when it comes to controlling the guns that have been used to kill and injure millions of Americans.
More than 60 Catholic priests, nuns, scholars and two former ambassadors to the Vatican sent a letter this week saying that if marchers and politicians truly want to defend life they should support ''common-sense reforms to address the epidemic of gun violence in our nation.'' 
They called in particular on Catholic lawmakers, naming the House speaker, John A. Boehner, and Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, both Republicans, as well as Senators Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, both Democrats, who they said have ''A'' ratings from the National Rifle Association, to stand up to the gun lobby. They urged support for legislation limiting the sale of military-style assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, like those used in the massacre last month at a school in Newtown, Conn.
''We're addressing life,'' said one of the signers, Thomas P. Melady, a Republican who served as ambassador to the Holy See under the first President George Bush. ''I accept the Catholic teachings, which promote the sanctity of life from conception to natural death. And certainly the death of the 20 young kids and 6 adults in Newtown was not natural. Why can't we take some steps with regards to these killings? These sophisticated weapons should be controlled.''
A theologian who signed the letter, Tobias Winright, an associate professor of theological ethics at St. Louis University, a Catholic institution, said that Pope John Paul II promoted the notion of a ''culture of life'' that encompassed opposition to abortion as well as euthanasia and the death penalty.
Professor Winright, a former law enforcement officer, said he was encouraged when the Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, recently praised American religious leaders and the Obama administration for proposals to limit guns.
Jeanne Monahan, the president of the March for Life Education and Defense Fund, which organizes the march, said that as a Catholic in the anti-abortion movement, ''We absolutely support the idea of being pro-life from conception to natural death.''
''Really, the difference between the little ones in Connecticut, which is so heartbreaking, and the little ones in the womb is their size and their age.''
But asked about the letter from the Catholic leaders, she said: ''I definitely have nothing to say about gun control. That's so out of the parameter of what we're about.''
Since the killings in Newtown, a broad spectrum of religious leaders have joined Faiths United to Prevent Gun Violence to demand controls on guns, but leaders of evangelical churches have been conspicuously absent. The National Association of Evangelicals surveyed its board of more than 100 members in December and found that 73 percent of them said that government should increase gun regulations. However, the association has not taken a position publicly.
A poll released this week by the Public Religion Research Institute, a nonpartisan research group in Washington, found that among the roughly two-thirds of white evangelical Protestants who say the term ''pro-life'' describes them very well, 64 percent are opposed to stricter gun control laws, while 33 percent favor them.
The picture among Catholics is the opposite. The poll found that of the 4 in 10 Catholics who say that ''pro-life'' describes them very well, 61 percent support stricter gun control laws and 33 percent oppose them. The survey was taken in January and included more than 1,000 respondents with a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points.
The nation's Catholic bishops supported the unsuccessful effort to renew the ban on assault weapons that expired in 2004 and recently reiterated a call to control the sale and use of firearms, said Kathy Saile, the director of the bishops' office of domestic social development.
''It wasn't a tough call,'' Ms. Saile said. ''All of our policy work is rooted in our consistent ethic for life, and our belief in the sacredness of all life.''
Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan of New York, the president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, told the Catholic News Service this month that he had told Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who is managing the White House response to the recent shootings, that the bishops would assist in ''the fight for greater gun control in the country.''
But John Gehring, the Catholic program director at Faith in Public Life, a liberal advocacy group in Washington, said that bishops who had demanded that Catholic legislators vote against abortion rights should do the same on gun control.
He said, ''Catholic lawmakers who call themselves pro-life and are pretty cozy with the N.R.A. shouldn't be getting a free pass.''

Prison Population Can Shrink When Police Crowd the Streets

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY

Now that the United States has the world's highest reported rate of incarceration, many criminologists are contemplating another strategy. What if America reverted to the penal policies of the 1980s? What if the prison population shrank drastically? What if money now spent guarding cellblocks was instead used for policing the streets?
In short, what would happen if the rest of the country followed New York City's example?
As the American prison population has doubled in the past two decades, the city has been a remarkable exception to the trend: the number of its residents in prison has shrunk. Its incarceration rate, once high by national standards, has plunged well below the United States average and has hit another new low, as Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced recently. And crime in the city has fallen by more than 75 percent, almost twice as much as in the rest of the country. 
Whatever has made New York the safest big city in America, that feat has certainly not been accomplished by locking up more criminals.
''The precise causes of New York's crime decline will be debated by social scientists until the Sun hits the Earth,'' said Michael Jacobson, a criminologist who ran the city's Correction and Probation Departments during the 1990s and is now the president of the Vera Institute of Justice, a criminal justice research group. ''But the 50,000-foot story from New York is that you can drive down crime while decreasing your jail and prison population -- and save a huge amount of money in the process.''
New York's singular success has attracted attention across the country from public officials whose budgets have been strained by the prison boom. The 2.3 million people behind bars in America, a fifth of the world's prisoners, cost taxpayers more than $75 billion a year. The strict penal policies were intended to reduce crime, but they have led to a historic, if largely unrecognized, shift in priorities away from policing.
''The United States today is the only country I know of that spends more on prisons than police,'' said Lawrence W. Sherman, an American criminologist on the faculties of the University of Maryland and Cambridge University in Britain. ''In England and Wales, the spending on police is twice as high as on corrections. In Australia it's more than three times higher. In Japan it's seven times higher. Only in the United States is it lower, and only in our recent history.''
Before the era of mass incarceration began in the 1980s, local policing accounted for more than 40 percent of spending for criminal justice, while 25 percent went to prisons and parole programs. But since 1990, nearly 35 percent has gone to the prison system, while the portion of criminal justice spending for local policing has fallen to slightly more than 30 percent.
New York, while now an exception to the mass-incarceration trend, also happens to be the place that inspired it. When New York State four decades ago commissioned an evaluation of programs to rehabilitate criminals, the conclusions were so discouraging that the researchers were initially forbidden to publish them.
Eventually one of the criminologists, Robert Martinson, summarized the results in 1974 in the journal Public Interest. His article, ''What Works? Questions and Answers About Prison Reform,'' was soon known as the ''nothing works'' thesis. Dr. Martinson concluded that rehabilitation strategies ''cannot overcome, or even appreciably reduce, the powerful tendencies of offenders to continue in criminal behavior.''
An outgrowth of the study was a consensus to eliminate parole for many offenders and to mandate long sentences determined by formulas rather than rely on the discretion of judges and parole boards.
Dr. Martinson wrote an article in 1979 recanting his ''nothing works'' conclusion, but by then it was too late. The trend toward tougher sentences continued, causing prison populations to grow rapidly in the 1980s throughout the country, including in New York. When crime kept rising anyway, sentences often were further lengthened.
But New York diverged from the national trend in the early 1990s, when it began expanding its police force and introduced a computerized system to track crimes and complaints. Officers also aggressively enforced laws against guns, illegal drugs and petty crimes like turnstile jumping in the subways. Arrests for misdemeanors increased sharply.
Yet serious crime went down. So though more people were being locked up for brief periods -- including many who were unable to make bail and were awaiting trial -- the local jail population was shrinking and fewer city residents were serving time in state prisons.
''Even with more people coming into the system, the overall bed count was declining because people weren't staying as long,'' Dr. Jacobson, who was correction commissioner from 1995 to 1998, recalled.
''It was a nightmare to administer because there was so much churning and turnover, but it was good news for the city.''
Saving $1.5 Billion a Year
Even as the city grew by nearly a million people in the last two decades, the number of New Yorkers behind bars fell by a third, to below 40,000 today.
If the city had followed the national trend, nearly 60,000 additional New Yorkers would be behind bars today, and the number of city and state correction officers would have more than doubled since 1990, said Franklin E. Zimring, a criminologist at the University of California, Berkeley.
By not expanding the jail and prison populations, he calculates in his 2011 book, ''The City That Became Safe,'' the city and the state have been saving $1.5 billion a year, more than twice as much as it cost to finance the additional police officers in the 1990s.
The crime decline, which has lasted for two decades, has been so striking that some critics wonder if the police stopped reporting some offenses. The police vehemently deny that, and numbers have continued dropping even for crimes that are difficult to hide -- homicides, most notably.
Policing, of course, is not the only possible explanation for the safer streets. A shift in demographics, the arrival of new immigrants, the waning of the crack epidemic, and other economic and social changes had an impact on neighborhoods in New York -- and in the rest of the country, where crime also declined in the 1990s.
But the drop was much steeper and more prolonged in New York than elsewhere. And while researchers attributed about a quarter of the decline in the rest of America to the stricter penal policies, that explanation did not apply to a city that was locking up fewer people. Something else was responsible, and criminologists have been trying to figure out how to repeat it.
''The intellectual tragedy of the New York crime miracle is that it had no experiments to identify just what worked,'' Dr. Sherman said.
His frustration is shared by David Weisburd, a criminologist at George Mason University in Virginia and Hebrew University in Jerusalem.
''As long as crime is going down, New York's police don't seem to want to know which strategies are working and which aren't,'' Dr. Weisburd said. ''When I proposed an experiment to one police official in the last administration, he replied, 'You could only bring me bad news.' ''
Elsewhere, studies have shown that crime drops when more police officers are hired, so it is not surprising that the expansion of New York's police force in the 1990s by more than a third was accompanied by a drop in crime. But during the past decade, the force has shrunk by 15 percent, and yet crime has mostly continued falling.
When Dr. Zimring and other criminologists look at this trend, and compare it with the fluctuating crime rates in other cities, they conclude that the retreat in crime in New York is not just a matter of the number of police officers. Those officers must be doing something right, but what exactly?
The most likely answer is a shift in strategy called hot-spot policing.
In the 1970s, research had shown that a small percentage of criminals committed a large share of crimes, so it had seemed logical to concentrate on catching repeat offenders and locking them up.
But after computerized crime mapping was introduced, it turned out that crime was even more concentrated by place than by person.
In city after city, researchers found that half of crimes occur within about 5 percent of an urban area -- a few buildings, intersections and blocks, often near transit stops and businesses like convenience stores, bars and nightclubs.
The criminal population keeps changing as men in their 30s drop out and are replaced by teenagers, but crimes keep occurring at the same places.
A Focus on Hot Spots
Researchers suggested: Perhaps the authorities should pay less attention to individual criminals and more attention to the hot spots where they operate.
Dr. Sherman, Dr. Weisburd and colleagues have tested the idea in randomized experiments in Jersey City; Houston; Kansas City, Mo.; Minneapolis; Philadelphia; Sacramento; and cities in Britain and Australia.
Typically, a list of hot spots was identified, and then half were randomly chosen to receive extra police attention, like more frequent patrols. Other strategies were also used, like improving street lighting, fencing vacant lots or arresting people for minor violations.
As hoped, there were fewer crimes and complaints at the hot spots chosen for extra attention than at those that were not. And once police officers started to show up often and at unpredictable intervals, they did not need to stay more than 15 minutes to have a lasting impact.
Nonetheless, the hot-spot strategy was initially met with skepticism by police veterans.
''We assumed that if we hit one area hard, the crime would just move somewhere else,'' said Frank Gajewski, a former police chief of Jersey City, who worked with Dr. Weisburd on the experiments there.
But Dr. Weisburd won over Mr. Gajewski and other skeptics -- and also won the 2010 Stockholm Prize, criminology's version of the Nobel -- by showing that crime was not simply being displaced. Moreover, he and his colleagues reported a ''spatial diffusion of crime prevention benefits'' because crime also declined in adjoining areas, as the police in Jersey City had observed.
''Crime doesn't move as easily we thought it did,'' Mr. Gajewski said. ''If I'm a robber, I want to be in a familiar, easily accessible place with certain characteristics. I need targets to rob, but I don't want people in the neighborhood watching me or challenging me. Maybe I work near a bus stop where there are vacant buildings or empty lots. If the police start focusing there, I can't just move to the next block and find the same conditions.''
After more than two dozen experiments around the world, criminologists generally agree that hot-spot policing is ''an effective crime prevention strategy,'' in the words of Anthony Braga, a criminologist at Harvard and Rutgers who led a review of the research literature last year.
Many experts also see it as the best explanation for the crime drop in New York. Although the city's police did not participate in randomized experiments, they did use computerized crime mapping to focus on hot spots in the 1990s. This strategy was intensified with a program called Operation Impact, which was started in 2003 by Raymond W. Kelly, then and now the police commissioner.
Commissioner Kelly gives the strategy credit for the continued decline of crime despite the reduced police force.
There is supporting evidence from Dennis C. Smith, a political scientist at New York University who led an analysis of trends in the dozens of precincts where the city's police focus on ''impact zones,'' as the hot spots are called. Rates of murder, rape, grand larceny, robbery and assault declined significantly faster in precincts with hot-spot policing than in those without it.
The Stop-and-Frisk Debate
One part of the hot-spot strategy in New York has been highly controversial: the stopping and frisking of hundreds of thousands of people each year, ostensibly to search for weapons or other contraband.
Some critics say that the tactic has been used so often and so brusquely in New York that it has undermined policing by arousing disrespect for the law, especially among young black and Latino men, who are disproportionately stopped and searched. Research shows that people who feel treated unfairly by the police can become more likely to commit crimes in the future.
''The million-dollar question in policing right now is whether there are ways to get the benefits of stop-and-frisk without the collateral costs,'' said Jens Ludwig, an economist who directs the University of Chicago Crime Lab. He found benefits from the tactic -- a decline in gunshot injuries -- in an experiment with the Pittsburgh police.
''Getting the police to stop people more often and search them for illegal guns does help keep guns off the street and reduce gun violence,'' Dr. Ludwig said. ''That's not to say whether or not stop-and-frisk is worth the costs that the practice imposes on society. But there's a complicated trade-off here that needs to be acknowledged.''
Defenders of stop-and-frisk, including Mayor Bloomberg, argue that when it is done properly and politely, the practice prevents crimes that disproportionately hurt the city's minorities.
''If New York went back to the policing of the 1980s,'' Dr. Smith said, ''there would be hundreds of thousands more victims of serious crimes every year, and the great majority of them would be African-American and Hispanic.''
Police officials note that if the homicide rate of the 1980s persisted, 1,200 additional New Yorkers, most of them black or Latino men, would have been killed last year -- when the police recorded 417 murders. Further, if the city's incarceration rate had followed the national trend, an additional 100,000 black and Hispanic men would have been sent to prison in the past decade, Dr. Zimring calculates.
Whether or not other cities adopt New York's specific stop-and-frisk tactics, social scientists say the rest of the country could benefit by adding police officers and concentrating on hot spots.
Dr. Ludwig and Philip J. Cook, a Duke University economist, calculate that nationwide, money diverted from prison to policing would buy at least four times as much reduction in crime. They suggest shrinking the prison population by a quarter and using the savings to hire another 100,000 police officers.
Diverting that money to the police would be tricky politically, because corrections budgets are zealously defended in state capitals by prison administrators, unions and legislators.
But there is at least one prison administrator, Dr. Jacobson, the former correction commissioner in New York, who would send the money elsewhere.
''If you had a dollar to spend on reducing crime, and you looked at the science instead of the politics, you would never spend it on the prison system,'' Dr. Jacobson said. ''There is no better example of big government run amok.''
That is the same lesson that William J. Bratton draws from his experience as New York's police commissioner in the 1990s. ''We showed in New York that the future of policing is not in handcuffs,'' Mr. Bratton said. ''The United States has locked up so many people that it has the highest incarceration rate in the world, but we can't arrest and incarcerate our way out of crime. We need to focus on preventing crime instead of responding to it.''

SCOTTSDALE, ARIZ. -- In your dreams, who would you rather be:
Rhett Butler, cussing out Scarlett O'Hara?
Bond, James Bond?
Steve McQueen, the King of Cool?
Batman, the Caped Crusader?
Or Roscoe Conkling Arbuckle, better known as Fatty?
How you answered may hold the key to understanding why confounding amounts of money were focused on particular cars at six recent auctions centered on this affluent Phoenix suburb. While bidders showered unprecedented amounts on a few cars with celebrity connections, others with ties to actors, politicians and blockbuster movies did not fare nearly as well.
The original Batmobile, which was based on the 1955 Lincoln Futura concept car, sold for a startling $4.62 million at the Barrett-Jackson auction here on Jan. 19. At the same auction, a 1955 Mercedes-Benz 300SL Gullwing that had once been owned by Clark Gable, the leading man of ''Gone With The Wind,'' sold for $2.035 million. (All prices include sales commissions.)
Yet Arbuckle's 1919 Pierce-Arrow Model 66 A-4 Tourer, resplendent in purple-blue paint -- the car was special-ordered by the silent-screen comedian, whose career crashed in a sex scandal -- did not sell. 
''The Arbuckle Pierce-Arrow is a magnificent automobile, one of the only custom-bodied Pierce-Arrows ever built and a true example of the Golden Age of automotive art and elegance,'' Craig Jackson, the auction company's chief executive, said.
But that wasn't enough to push the car over its reserve, prompting Mr. Jackson to add, ''The Clark Gable Gullwing clearly resonated with our buyers more so than Fatty Arbuckle's vehicle.''
Why is that?
''In the collector car world, there is celebrity, and then there is celebrity that matters,'' Alain Squindo, vice president of RM Auctions, said in a telephone interview last week. ''Clark Gable was the King of Hollywood, and Steve McQueen was the King of Cool. People today aren't so sure anymore who Fatty Arbuckle even was.''
Arbuckle, who died 80 years ago, was a huge star, literally and figuratively, and one of the best-paid. But his reputation was ruined by accusations of rape and murder in 1921; he was acquitted after two mistrials, and sold the car to pay legal bills.
''Arbuckle's Pierce-Arrow was just about the most important car of its day,'' said McKeel Hagerty, chief executive of Hagerty Insurance, which specializes in coverage for collectible cars. ''But nowadays, that is so many generations ago.''
These days, baby boomers move the collector-car market, and many of those with lots of disposable income seem less interested in historical artifacts than in the toys and touchstones of their youth.
''That hits the nail on the head,'' Mr. Squindo said. ''It is stuff that matters to guys -- men of a certain age -- who grew up in that era. How many guys didn't want to be James Bond?''
Perhaps that helps to explain why a 1964 Aston Martin DB5, made famous in ''Goldfinger,'' sold at an RM auction in 2010 for $4.6 million. ''That was at a time when any other DB5 in the world would have sold for about one-tenth of that,'' Mr. Squindo said. Of course, the Bond car was famously equipped with all the gadgets a mid-1960s secret agent might require, including oil sprayers, hidden machine guns and a seat that could eject a passenger.
More grown men may have dreamed of being Bond than Batman. But Rick Champagne, the 53-year-old founder of a Phoenix-area transportation company, made a move worthy of Bruce Wayne by stepping up to pay millions for the original television Batmobile. He told a Speed channel interviewer that he planned to rip out a wall in his living room so he could park the car inside his house.
Yet owners of the many Batmobile replicas and knockoffs should not expect values to rise as they have for DB4s and DB5s.
Mr. Hagerty said that ''while all Aston Martins may have doubled in value, thanks to that Bond car, it's very rare that any other cars enjoy the same mystique.''
Mr. Squindo cited another example, a 1970 Porsche 911S that RM sold in 2011 for what seemed an astonishing price.
''The only reason bidding on that car skyrocketed to $1.37 million was that it was Steve McQueen's 911,'' Mr. Squindo said. ''It was even painted in an unusual slate gray -- his favorite color.
''The car, like any other 911S you could find, was worth a couple hundred thousand, at best. The McQueen provenance, in that case, was worth over a million.''
So how much value did a Clark Gable connection add to a 1955 Mercedes Gullwing? ''Perhaps a million,'' Mr. Squindo said, noting that an exceptional red '55 model sold for $847,000 at RM's Phoenix auction.
''While celebrity provenance can help a car's value,'' Mr. Squindo said, ''it rarely, if ever, can hurt a car.''
Sometimes, it just doesn't matter. Consider the 1935 Cadillac V-12 Convertible Sedan that sold at the RM auction in Phoenix for an unremarkable $99,000. The car was originally owned by Harold Lloyd, another star of silent movies, and it made a memorable appearance in last year's Academy Award-winning film, ''The Artist.''
Gene Osborne, the Colorado cattleman who bought the car, said he really didn't care about the Cadillac's provenance; he told the seller, Jennifer Sparks Bushman, he just wanted a big open car from the '30s that he could drive around his ranch and take to some car shows.
Other cars with various degrees of celebrity pedigrees sold for unpredictable and widely varied prices. The 1941 Lincoln that served as Sonny Corleone's car in ''The Godfather'' brought $69,000 at Bonhams; a 1941 Packard once owned by Sonja Henie, the figure skater and film star, sold for $176,000 at Gooding & Company; and a customized 1957 Ford Thunderbird with Sinatra provenance (Nancy, not Frank) went for $50,600 at Barrett-Jackson.
Mr. Squindo noted that a 1955 Cadillac Series 75 presidential limousine primarily used by President Dwight D. Eisenhower's wife, Mamie, attracted bids up to $105,000, but failed to sell at the RM auction. ''Certainly, fewer of us remember people of that era, like Mamie Eisenhower,'' he said.
Every adult, however, remembers George W. Bush, and that familiarity no doubt helped to drive up bidding for the former President's 2009 Ford F-150 King Ranch pickup. With Jay Leno presiding, the truck sold for $300,000 at Barrett-Jackson with the proceeds going to charity.
That, according to KBB.com, was about 10 times the value of a comparable nonpresidential F-150.

How This Got to Be a Biden Moment

BYLINE: By MARK LEIBOVICH

SECTION: Section ST; Column 0; Style Desk; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 1387 words

WASHINGTON -- President Obama had just finished taking the oath and the Marine band played ''Hail to the Chief'' and the cameras panned to children waving little flags. Inaugurations are momentous things.
And then, after the benediction, I opened an e-mail from my friend Matt, who had extracted another unalienable truth from the proceedings:
''Biden is a testament to the transforming power of successful hair plugs.''
Well yes, he is, though the hair plugs are not a new Biden phenomenon. What's telling here is that at a spectacle so potent and on a stage so crowded, the eye would be so naturally drawn to the goofball understudy. In that sense, Matt represents a cultural wave. 
''Transforming'' is the key word. In a few short months, the motor-tongued, muscle-car-loving heartbeat-away hell raiser has been transformed from gaffe-prone amusement to someone whose star shines as brightly as his teeth. He is the subject of viral C-Span videos, sitcom infatuations and an ''autobiography'' of his Onion-inspired alter-ego, ''Diamond'' Joe Biden, ''The President of Vice.'' (In his spare time, Mr. Biden also helped avert the fiscal cliff, is spearheading the White House plan to reduce gun violence and might even run for president in 2016.)
We might sit at the dawn of the second Obama term, with Hillary in waiting, Republicans in therapy and Congressional approvals in sub-cockroach and colonoscopy territory. But for whatever reason, the perfect flower of this peculiar moment grows from the earthy core of Joseph Robinette Biden Jr.
He may not be the most popular politician in America. Mr. Biden's approval rating stands at 49 percent in the latest New York Times/CBS poll; not bad, but still a shade lower than his boss's (51 percent). Mrs. Clinton trounces him in early surveys of Democrats eyeing the prospective field for 2016. Yet Mr. Biden wins in a landslide in an unscientific snapshot of comic appreciation, cult appeal and of-the-moment awesomeness. The White House recently received a petition from citizens insisting that a new reality show be created featuring the vice president (2,482 signatures at this writing).
Here is one theory on why. In 1968, Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey spoke of something he called ''The Politics of Joy,'' a slogan he adopted to accentuate his trademark zest and enthusiasm as he ran for president. In fact, the notion was dreadfully off-pitch given the war, assassinations and upheaval of the day, and Mr. Humphrey took some ridicule for it.
Mr. Biden, however, represents an updated standard-bearer for the politics of joy, said Joel K. Goldstein, a law professor at Saint Louis University and an expert on the United States vice presidency. (Disclosure: I quote Mr. Goldstein whenever possible, just so I can type the words ''expert on the United States vice presidency,'' which never fails to amuse me.) While these are not exactly joyous times either -- politicians are often reviled and voters are no picnic -- Mr. Biden is the one major Washington figure who consistently evokes a sense of thrill in what he is doing.
Through receiving lines, pro forma thank-you calls and random glad-handing, he conveys an aura that he would rather be doing nothing else. The video of Mr. Biden swearing in newly elected members and greeting their families in the Old Senate Chamber this month provided 86 minutes of viral eloquence on this.
''Spread your legs -- you're going to be frisked,'' Mr. Biden ordered the husband of the new North Dakota senator, Heidi Heitkamp, after he was instructed by a photographer to put his hands at his side. Ms. Heitkamp cracked up, and Mr. Biden then explained -- helpfully! -- that when someone says ''drop your hands to your side'' to ''somebody in North Dakota, they think it's a frisk.'' Now better informed, the Heitkamps went on their way.
Mr. Biden also told the brother of the Republican senator Tim Scott that he could ''help with'' his ''pecs.'' As everyone knows, Mr. Biden is a fitness god. And not in that trendy P90X Paul Ryan way. ''There's gym strong and there's old man strong,'' explained the ''Saturday Night Live'' Biden, played by Jason Sudeikis, last October. ''When the Amtrak breaks down during my morning commute, I strip down to my tighty-whiteys'' and push it ''all the way to Washington!''
Can't really see Mitch McConnell doing that, can you? Indeed, the Biden Moment is also born of contrast. Would The Onion put a shirtless John Kerry washing a Trans Am in the driveway of the State Department? Speaker Boehner wearing a ponytail at the Inauguration? Harry Reid getting banned for life from Dave & Buster's restaurants (''following dozens of complaints from wait staff and numerous incidents'')? Actually those last few might be pretty funny.
''THIS ISN'T HAPPENING. This isn't real.'' -- Leslie Knope.
It really is, it really is! Or at least sitcom real. That was actually Mr. Biden, the real V.P., standing before Leslie, the civic-possessed character played by Amy Poehler, on a recent ''Parks and Recreation'' episode. Leslie's fiancי, Ben, surprised her by setting up the meeting with her mega-crush/idol during a trip to Washington. (In an earlier show, Leslie had declared that her ideal man would ''have the brain of George Clooney and the body of Joe Biden.'')
''You must be Leslie Knope,'' Mr. Biden says. ''Welcome.''
''You're ... my name just came out of your mouth,'' Leslie swoons.
''Well, yeah, it did,'' he replies.
Leslie stammers, clutches the V.P., demurs on his nonexistent offer of Hillary Clinton's secretary of state job. She caresses Mr. Biden's face. Nonplused but still welcoming, his reaction is perfect.
''You're very handsome, by the way,'' Leslie adds, clutching his arms. Walking out, she turns sharply to a Secret Service agent. ''Don't let anything happen to him, you understand me?'' she says firmly. ''He is precious cargo.''
The scene was shot in two takes last July and was broadcast a few days after the election in November. Ms. Poehler praised Mr. Biden on the NBC Web site for keeping his composure ''while I harassed him and invaded his personal space.''
Personal space invasion is also a big part of Mr. Biden's repertory. His relentless flirtation with the mother of Senator John Barrasso at the swearing-in was particularly for-the-ages: it included Mr. Biden touching her face, resting his hand high under her arm during the photo pose, throwing his arm around her at various times, speaking about two inches from her nose and pulling her close for another hug while the two of them posed for a special photo. ''I'm 90 years old,'' Louise Barrasso told him, to which the V.P. said, ''I'll tell you what, 20 years from now, when I show my kids this picture, you will have to come and sign it.'' He gave her one last peck on the cheek and a ''God love ya.''
One of the keys of Mr. Biden's comedic appeal is his willingness to play along. ''A smart politician just goes with it,'' said Ted Widmer, a historian at Brown University and a former speechwriter for President Bill Clinton. Mr. Widmer said the vice president's embrace of the Onion's fixation on him shows a level of acceptance that other politicians can learn from. ''These things can't be stopped anyway,'' Mr. Widmer said. ''It's a virus, out of control. So you might as well participate and have fun. It shows a quality of humanity.''
This was on shiny display last week -- like a showroom Corvette -- as The Onion released its e-book autobiography of Mr. Biden. The Onion Biden -- a k a ''Diamond'' Joe Biden -- participated in a Reddit ''Ask Me Anything'' thread to promote ''The President of Vice.''
To top that, the vice president himself -- the real precious cargo! -- tweeted in, declaring ''#imavetteguy'' to his Onion alter-ego. This was later re-tweeted by the president's account.
Personally, my favorite image from the whole Biden Moment occurred during a brief interlude at the end of the Senate swearing-in parade. When there were no more senators left to initiate, photos to mug for or moms to hug, Mr. Biden stood at the front of the chamber looking out at the emptying room. For a split second, he looked lost, maybe even sad. He folded his hands at his waist, twiddled his thumbs and then, with his eyes twinkling again, put out a last plaintive call: ''Anyone else want to be sworn in as a Senator today?''

Thy Neighbor's Flag

BYLINE: By PHILIP GALANES

SECTION: Section ST; Column 0; Style Desk; SOCIAL Q'S; Pg. 8

LENGTH: 759 words

I live on a suburban road. About a mile from me, a Confederate flag flies in the side yard of a house. The owner flies many small American flags in the front yard. But the Confederate flag bothers me as a symbol of slavery and segregation, and I suspect that people like me are not welcome there. I stopped to say something, but no one answered the door. What do you make of this?
John, Lenoir City, Tenn. 
Let's wait a sec before we call in Django and Quentin Tarantino (and the 34 cubic tons of fake blood that go hand-in-hand with unchaining them). I would never fly a Confederate flag for the reasons you suggest. But it sounds as if you may be describing a flag collector, not a white supremacist. Surely there's a difference between displaying a multitude of American flags, including one Confederate model shunted off to the side lawn, and hanging one from the tippity top of a municipal building.
But who am I to rob you of your feelings -- or prevent an awkward meeting between neighbors? If the flag really bothers you, visit again. Start with a pleasant introduction: ''Hi, I'm John. I live about a mile down the road.'' Then move onto disclaimer and polite request: ''I have no right to tell you what to do in your own yard. But I'd appreciate it if you could rethink that Confederate flag.'' Now for flattery and the big finish: ''I'm sure you don't mean it as a paean to slavery or segregation. But it hurts me when I drive by.''
If the neighbors refuse to remove it, excuse yourself politely and use MapQuest to find alternate driving routes. If they agree (or offer to think about it), thank them and move along. Perhaps they will alter their display. But even if not, you will have given a stranger the benefit of the doubt, and expressed your beliefs in a way that you can be proud of.
Carrot and Stick
My roommate is a vegan, and I am a vegetarian, for both moral and health reasons. Occasionally, I see her eating something I'm fairly certain isn't vegan. A surprising amount of food, like candy corn, contains animal products. Is it rude for me to point out these slips, or should I speak up? If I were eating something non-vegetarian (other than marshmallows, which I allow myself), I'd like to know.
T. C., Washington
Excuse me while I finish my B.L.T. (Kidding! It's actually my second B.L.T.) You make an interesting distinction between unknowing slips and guilty pleasures. With the former, your roommate may welcome your intervention. With the latter, she may find you a spoilsport or a scold.
Wait until neither of you is eating and say: ''Other than marshmallows, which I adore, will you let me know if I am about to chow down on something non-vegetarian?'' After she agrees, ask: ''Would you like me to return the favor, or do you prefer to enjoy your slips in peace?'' And thus will you know.
If Asked, Can't Go
I am a 35-year-old woman. Last month, both of my divorced parents received elaborate invitations from a cousin for his daughter's bat mitzvah. My two adult sisters and I did not. A few days ago, we received messages from our cousin, via Facebook, asking whether we planned to attend the event because they are finalizing the head count. I don't believe that all three of our invitations were somehow lost in the mail. Am I really expected to respond to an event I was never invited to?
C.S.
So, you've landed on a theory that your cousin didn't invite you, intentionally, and is now trying to cover it up with a cockamamie Facebook message? I don't buy that any more than postal incompetence. It seems far likelier that the logistics of the occasion overwhelmed him, and your invitation slipped through the cracks. Reply (or pull out all the stops and phone him): ''We didn't receive an invitation, but we'd be delighted to come'' -- or we're busy, as the case may be. Let she who has pulled off a big event without wrinkle cast the first stone.
Parting Word
A friend signs her text messages to me, ''Love, Susie.'' I feel as if a gun is being held to my head and guilty that I don't return her love or her signoff. What to do?
Anonymous
Something tells me you have never had an actual gun to your head. Here's hoping you never will. Folks develop habitual signoffs: ''Best,'' ''Cheers,'' ''xo'' -- even ''Love.'' Develop a signature style for your pals and stick with it. Few correspondents will notice, and even fewer will care.
For help with your awkward situation, send a question to SocialQ@nytimes.com or SocialQ on Facebook. You can also address your queries on Twitter to @SocialQPhilip. Please include a daytime phone number.

Rio's Exploding Manholes Menace Residents and Highlight Aging Infrastructure

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO and TAYLOR BARNES; Lis Horta Moriconi contributed reporting.

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 5

LENGTH: 1042 words

RIO DE JANEIRO -- David McLaughlin was thrilled to be in Brazil. He had arrived here from Ohio State University on a Fulbright grant to research Brazilian hip-hop music with his wife, Sarah Lowry, a scholar of Russian literature. The graduate students, newlyweds, set out one morning in June 2010 to search for an apartment in the beachfront neighborhood of Copacabana.
Then, while crossing a bustling avenue, the asphalt under their feet started to tremble. A fireball surged suddenly from a manhole, enveloping Ms. Lowry in flames. Mr. McLaughlin leapt on her and extinguished the fire. But Ms. Lowry had burns on 80 percent of her body and spent 70 days in the hospital here. Mr. McLaughlin was burned on 35 percent of his body. 
''The explosion was one of the most traumatic experiences I can imagine,'' Mr. McLaughlin, 34, said in a telephone interview from New York, where he and his wife now live. ''Almost three years later, recovering is made more complicated every time we learn there's been a new explosion on the streets of Rio.''
Since 2010, manhole explosions here have shattered windows, flattened cars and injured passers-by. An explosion in 2012 killed a worker at Rio's port. While the rate of explosions has slowed, the city was rattled yet again in December after a manhole erupted behind the Copacabana Palace, the neo-Classical-style gem that is arguably Rio's most luxurious hotel. A motorcyclist narrowly escaped the recent blast, filming with his cellphone his motorcycle going up in flames.
Such explosions are not unique to Rio. Indeed, engineering experts say few large cities are immune. Gas from any number of sources can collect underground. Electrical cables, often running in the same pipes, can fray with age, producing a spark that can set off an explosion, shooting up fire and flinging hundred-pound cast-iron manhole covers high into the air.
But Moacyr Duarte, a senior researcher on the city's infrastructure at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, said dozens of explosions here, which often occurred in densely-populated areas, had ''clearly gone beyond what it is statistically reasonable,'' before recently declining.
The explosions have set Cariocas, as the residents of this traditionally relaxed city are known, on edge, and the blasts point to the broader problem of dilapidated infrastructure even as Rio emerges from a long economic decline.
As Rio prepares for its cameo as host of the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympics, the expansion of offshore oil production has pumped life into its economy. The city has sought to revitalize neglected areas with projects like a new cable car system in Complexo do Alemדo, a patchwork of slums, while a real estate boom has attracted the likes of Donald J. Trump, who plans to build five skyscrapers.
At the same time, Rio's resurgence has only added to the stress on its aging infrastructure.
While passenger traffic at Rio's international airport climbed 20 percent last year, it has been plagued by blackouts in recent weeks, escalators and elevators work sporadically, and vultures have descended through holes in the airport's roof.
Rio's car fleet grew 56 percent in the last decade, but road building and public transportation improvements failed to keep pace, intensifying traffic jams. Last year in downtown Rio, a 20-story office building just collapsed one night, knocking down two other buildings and killing 17 people.
Amid such challenges, erupting manholes have endured as just one more bizarre and potentially dangerous feature of the cityscape.
Some Cariocas have found dark humor in the sheer randomness. A video game for Facebook, ''Rio Boom-eiro Challenge,'' involves the nimble avoidance of sidewalk explosions.
Others have found artistic inspiration. Fבbio Maia, an advertising executive, has been putting stickers in the shape of a lighted fuse alongside manholes. The idea came to him one day after he was dodging manholes while out with his son in a stroller. ''I started asking myself, 'What kind of craziness is this?' '' he said.
Mr. Duarte, of Federal University, said many of the manhole eruptions have been caused by leaks of gas or oil into overloaded underground networks, some built as far back as the 1920s.
After a surge in street explosions in 2010 and 2011, Rio's mayor, Eduardo Paes, and prosecutors pressured utility companies into agreeing to pay fines of about $50,000 for each explosion, in addition to damages to victims.
(The electric company, Light, said it had not yet reached an agreement to pay damages to Mr. McLaughlin and Ms. Lowry.)
Mr. Paes's office said in a statement that the ''worst phase'' of the manhole crisis was over, explaining that an emergency operation in 28 neighborhoods that ended last year identified 314 manholes with a great risk of explosion, and that crews were sent to fix each one.
Still, the mayor's office acknowledged that the issue ''hasn't been completely addressed,'' prompting Mr. Paes to raise the fine for each explosion to $250,000 and to advance a project mapping the city's entire underground network.
Light said it had undertaken a $115 million investment program in the last two years aimed at preventing more explosions.
The company declined to provide figures on how many explosions had occurred recently on Rio's streets, but it argued that they had become less frequent. ''Eventualities in subterranean chambers occur around the world,'' the company said.
Manholes continue to explode. The mayor's office acknowledged that at least five blasts occurred in 2012, leaving one person dead and several injured. The explosion in December in Copacabana, one of Rio's most populous districts, sowed panic among passers-by.
Antפnio Carlos Costa, president of Rio de Paz, a human rights group that has painted Rio's manhole covers red to bring attention to their potential danger, said the blasts offered a view into the perils that the new economic climate has been unable to resolve.
''In Brazil we have two types of violence,'' he said, ''intentional violence and violence that is a product of neglect. This is a type of violence that is more subtle, but is very present in Brazilian culture. The country is economically strong, but we do not have a culture of protecting human life.''

A City in Egypt Erupts in Chaos Over Sentences

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK and MAYY EL SHEIKH

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 1403 words

CAIRO -- Egypt's new government lost control of a major city, Port Said, on Saturday as rampaging soccer fans attacked the main jail, drove police officers from the streets and cut off all access to the city.
Set off by the sentencing of 21 Port Said soccer fans to death, the rioting was the sharpest challenge yet to the efforts of Egypt's new Islamist rulers to re-establish order after the two years of turmoil that have followed the overthrow of Hosni Mubarak, Egypt's autocratic president.
By evening, fighting in the streets had left at least 30 people dead, mostly from gunfire, and injured more than 300. Residents said they were afraid to leave their homes. Doctors said the local hospital was overloaded with casualties and pleaded for help. Rioters sacked and burned a police barracks; attacked police stations, the Port Said power plant and the jail, where the convicted men were being held; and closed off all roads to the city as well as the railroad station.
President Mohamed Morsi canceled a foreign trip to deal with the crisis at home and instead met with the National Defense Council, which includes the nation's top military leaders. A spokesman for the Interior Ministry acknowledged that its security forces were unable to control the violence and urged that political leaders to try to calm the rioters. 
By 8 p.m., a spokesman for the Egyptian military said its troops had moved in and secured vital facilities, including the prison, the Mediterranean port, and the Suez Canal. But in telephone interviews, residents said the streets remained lawless. ''I'm worried for my sister and mother,'' said Ahmed Zangir, 21. ''I could run or do something, but it is not safe for them to get out.''
Mr. Zangir added: ''Thugs are abusing the opportunity. They are everywhere.''
Friday was the second anniversary of the revolt that toppled Mr. Mubarak, an occasion that had already set off clashes between protesters and security forces in Cairo and other cities. Those battles began Thursday and continued for a third day on Saturday in Cairo, Suez and Alexandria. In Suez, where two police officers and seven protesters were killed on Friday, protesters attacked police stations and attempted to set fire to a central security building.
The anniversary battles were fueled by a combination of hostility toward the country's new Islamist leaders and frustration with the meager rewards of the revolution so far. But those battles were more isolated, typically confined to just a few blocks around symbols of government power, like the Interior Ministry headquarters in Cairo or the headquarters of the provincial government in Suez.
In contrast, the escalating chaos that enveloped Port Said over the soccer riot sentencing posed a far greater challenge to the Islamist leaders, who have pledged a new era of respect for the law.
It was unclear how the fledgling government might regain control of the city without either a brutal crackdown on the mob or capitulation to its demands. And either alternative could further inflame the streets in Cairo and around Egypt.
The information minister said the National Defense Council had the authority to impose a curfew or a state of emergency over any trouble spot. But in an illustration of the political risks to any perception of a crackdown, a spokesman for the president, Yassir Ali, declared a few hours later that there was no intention to impose a curfew on Port Said.
In a television interview, Gen. Osama Ismail, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry, acknowledged that the violence had spiraled beyond the control of the security forces. ''The solution isn't a security solution,'' he said. ''We urge the political and patriotic leaders and forces to intervene to calm the situation.''
The case that set off the riot grew out of a deadly brawl last February between rival groups of hard-core fans of soccer teams from Cairo and Port Said at a match in Port Said. The hard-core fans, called Ultras, are known for their appetite for violence against either rival fans or the police. Some had smuggled knives and other weapons into the stadium, security officials said at the time.
Seventy-four people were killed and over 1,000 injured in the soccer riot. Many died after being trampled under the stampeding crowds or falling from stadium balconies, according to forensic testimony later reported in the state news media.
It was the worst soccer riot in Egyptian history and among the worst in the world. Many political figures, including members of Mr. Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood, initially sought to blame a counterrevolutionary conspiracy orchestrated by Mubarak loyalists or the Interior Ministry.
But prosecutors ultimately charged 21 Port Said fans with attacking their Cairo rivals and charged nine security officers with negligence. On Saturday, a judge in Cairo convicted the 21 fans of murder before passing sentence. Six of them remain fugitives.
The verdict was awaited with acute anxiety because any outcome risked the fury of the Ultras in either Port Said or Cairo. To warn of their wrath if the Port Said defendants were acquitted, the Cairo Ultras staged several raucous protests last week in anticipation of the verdict, temporarily closing bridges and subways lines and threatening the Egyptian stock exchange.
The trial was held in Cairo instead of Port Said because of the fear of violence between the two groups of Ultras. For the same reason, the Interior Ministry declined to transfer the defendants to the Cairo courtroom to hear the verdict, leaving them in detention in their home city.
Most of those killed in Port Said on Saturday died of bullet wounds, hospital officials said. It was unclear who shot first, but witnesses said some of the civilian protesters brought shotguns or homemade firearms to attack the prison. And after two security officers were killed, the gunfire escalated sharply there and around the city, witnesses and officials said. All of the other people killed were believed to be civilians.
Rioters also attacked members of the news media, damaging television cameras and cutting off live broadcasts.
Many said the severity of the penalty was out of step with the light verdicts handed down in high-profile cases against members of the old government. The soccer fans were sentenced to death for a brawl that killed several dozen people. But no police officer or security official has yet been held responsible for the killing of 800 civilian demonstrators during the 18 days of protests two years ago. The only people convicted were Mr. Mubarak and his interior minister, and those verdicts were overturned this month.
''Where are the officers of the Ministry of Interior and the military council in this verdict?'' Mahmoud Affifi, a spokesman for the left-leaning April 6 group, told the state newspaper Al Ahram, referring to the generals who ruled Egypt for 18 months after Mr. Mubarak.
The Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist group allied with Mr. Morsi, said in a statement that it blamed the news media for inciting violence against legitimately elected authorities. The group also castigated leaders of the political opposition for ''silence instead of condemning these crimes, and even in some cases welcoming them.''
Those plotting the violence ''must be condemned by all members of the society, and they must be held accountable according to the provisions of the law,'' the Brotherhood said. ''It's incomprehensible to demand the rights of the martyrs by adding more martyrs and victims.''
Adding to the popular outrage over the verdict, the judge hearing the case, Sobhi Abdel Megeed, had imposed a complete ban on publishing or broadcasting news from the last two months of the soccer riot trial, including details of the charges, evidence or judicial reasoning.
On Saturday, Judge Megeed noted again that the court had asked the public prosecutor ''to move criminal cases against anybody who would violate the publishing ban, no matter what their position is.''
Most in Cairo had expected an acquittal. Speculation had centered on the wrath of the capital's Ultras if their attackers walked free. Instead, families of those killed in the soccer riot who were in the courtroom erupted in jubilation when hearing the news of the death penalty. Relatives held pictures of the victims in the air. Some danced and chanted. A few fainted. And the Ultras celebrated for hours outside their team's headquarters in Cairo.

Selling a New Generation on Guns

BYLINE: By MIKE McINTIRE

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; BEARING ARMS; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 2765 words

Threatened by long-term declining participation in shooting sports, the firearms industry has poured millions of dollars into a broad campaign to ensure its future by getting guns into the hands of more, and younger, children.
The industry's strategies include giving firearms, ammunition and cash to youth groups; weakening state restrictions on hunting by young children; marketing an affordable military-style rifle for ''junior shooters'' and sponsoring semiautomatic-handgun competitions for youths; and developing a target-shooting video game that promotes brand-name weapons, with links to the Web sites of their makers.
The pages of Junior Shooters, an industry-supported magazine that seeks to get children involved in the recreational use of firearms, once featured a smiling 15-year-old girl clutching a semiautomatic rifle. At the end of an accompanying article that extolled target shooting with a Bushmaster AR-15 -- an advertisement elsewhere in the magazine directed readers to a coupon for buying one -- the author encouraged youngsters to share the article with a parent.
''Who knows?'' it said. ''Maybe you'll find a Bushmaster AR-15 under your tree some frosty Christmas morning!'' 
The industry's youth-marketing effort is backed by extensive social research and is carried out by an array of nonprofit groups financed by the gun industry, an examination by The New York Times found. The campaign picked up steam about five years ago with the completion of a major study that urged a stronger emphasis on the ''recruitment and retention'' of new hunters and target shooters.
The overall objective was summed up in another study, commissioned last year by the shooting sports industry, that suggested encouraging children experienced in firearms to recruit other young people. The report, which focused on children ages 8 to 17, said these ''peer ambassadors'' should help introduce wary youngsters to guns slowly, perhaps through paintball, archery or some other less intimidating activity.
''The point should be to get newcomers started shooting something, with the natural next step being a move toward actual firearms,'' said the report, which was prepared for the National Shooting Sports Foundation and the Hunting Heritage Trust.
Firearms manufacturers and their two primary surrogates, the National Rifle Association of America and the National Shooting Sports Foundation, have long been associated with high-profile battles to fend off efforts at gun control and to widen access to firearms. The public debate over the mass shootings in Newtown, Conn., and elsewhere has focused largely on the availability of guns, along with mental illness and the influence of violent video games.
Little attention has been paid, though, to the industry's youth-marketing initiatives. They stir passionate views, with proponents arguing that introducing children to guns can provide a safe and healthy pastime, and critics countering that it fosters a corrosive gun culture and is potentially dangerous.
The N.R.A. has for decades given grants for youth shooting programs, mostly to Boy Scout councils and 4-H groups, which traditionally involved single-shot rimfire rifles, BB guns and archery. Its $21 million in total grants in 2010 was nearly double what it gave out five years earlier.
Newer initiatives by other organizations go further, seeking to introduce children to high-powered rifles and handguns while invoking the same rationale of those older, more traditional programs: that firearms can teach ''life skills'' like responsibility, ethics and citizenship. And the gun industry points to injury statistics that it says show a greater likelihood of getting hurt cheerleading or playing softball than using firearms for fun and sport.
Still, some experts in child psychiatry say that encouraging youthful exposure to guns, even in a structured setting with an emphasis on safety, is asking for trouble. Dr. Jess P. Shatkin, the director of undergraduate studies in child and adolescent mental health at New York University, said that young people are naturally impulsive and that their brains ''are engineered to take risks,'' making them ill suited for handling guns.
''There are lots of ways to teach responsibility to a kid,'' Dr. Shatkin said. ''You don't need a gun to do it.''
Steve Sanetti, the president of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, said it was better to instruct children in the safe use of a firearm through hunting and target shooting, and engage them in positive ways with the heritage of guns in America. His industry is well positioned for the task, he said, but faces an unusual challenge: introducing minors to activities that involve products they cannot legally buy and that require a high level of maturity.
Ultimately, Mr. Sanetti said, it should be left to parents, not the government, to decide if and when to introduce their children to shooting and what sort of firearms to use.
''It's a very significant decision,'' he said, ''and it involves the personal responsibility of the parent and personal responsibility of the child.''
Trying to Reverse a Trend
The shooting sports foundation, the tax-exempt trade association for the gun industry, is a driving force behind many of the newest youth initiatives. Its national headquarters is in Newtown, just a few miles from Sandy Hook Elementary School, where Adam Lanza, 20, used his mother's Bushmaster AR-15 to kill 20 children and 6 adults last month.
The foundation's $26 million budget is financed mostly by gun companies, associated businesses and the foundation's SHOT Show, the industry's annual trade show, according to its latest tax return.
Although shooting sports and gun sales have enjoyed a rebound recently, the long-term demographics are not favorable, as urbanization, the growth of indoor pursuits like video games and changing cultural mores erode consumer interest. Licensed hunters fell from 7 percent of the population in 1975 to fewer than 5 percent in 2005, according to federal data. Galvanized by the declining share, the industry redoubled its efforts to reverse the trend about five years ago.
The focus on young people has been accompanied by foundation-sponsored research examining popular attitudes toward hunting and shooting. Some of the studies used focus groups and telephone surveys of teenagers to explore their feelings about guns and people who use them, and offered strategies for generating a greater acceptance of firearms.
The Times reviewed more than a thousand pages of these studies, obtained from gun industry Web sites and online archives, some of them produced as recently as last year. Most were prepared by consultants retained by the foundation, and at least one was financed with a grant from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.
In an interview, Mr. Sanetti said the youth-centered research was driven by the inevitable ''tension'' the industry faces, given that no one under 18 can buy a rifle or a shotgun from a licensed dealer or even possess a handgun under most circumstances. That means looking for creative and appropriate ways to introduce children to shooting sports.
''There's nothing alarmist or sinister about it,'' Mr. Sanetti said. ''It's realistic.''
Pointing to the need to ''start them young,'' one study concluded that ''stakeholders such as managers and manufacturers should target programs toward youth 12 years old and younger.''
''This is the time that youth are being targeted with competing activities,'' it said. ''It is important to consider more hunting and target-shooting recruitment programs aimed at middle school level, or earlier.''
Aware that introducing firearms to young children could meet with resistance, several studies suggested methods for smoothing the way for target-shooting programs in schools. One cautioned, ''When approaching school systems, it is important to frame the shooting sports only as a mechanism to teach other life skills, rather than an end to itself.''
In another report, the authors warned against using human silhouettes for targets when trying to recruit new shooters and encouraged using words and phrases like ''sharing the experience,'' ''family'' and ''fun.'' They also said children should be enlisted to prod parents to let them join shooting activities: ''Such a program could be called 'Take Me Hunting' or 'Take Me Shooting.' ''
The industry recognized that state laws limiting hunting by children could pose a problem, according to a ''Youth Hunting Report'' prepared by the shooting sports foundation and two other groups. Declaring that ''the need for aggressive recruitment is urgent,'' the report said a primary objective should be to ''eliminate or reduce age minimums.'' Still another study recommended allowing children to get a provisional license to hunt with an adult, ''perhaps even before requiring them to take hunter safety courses.''
The effort has succeeded in a number of states, including Wisconsin, which in 2009 lowered the minimum hunting age to 10 from 12, and Michigan, where in 2011 the age minimum for hunting small game was eliminated for children accompanied by an adult mentor. The foundation cited statistics suggesting that youth involvement in hunting, as well as target shooting, had picked up in recent years amid the renewed focus on recruitment.
Gun companies have spent millions of dollars to put their recruitment strategies into action, either directly or through the shooting sports foundation and other organizations. The support takes many forms.
The Scholastic Steel Challenge, started in 2009, introduces children as young as 12 to competitive handgun shooting using steel targets. Its ''platinum'' sponsors include the shooting sports foundation, Smith & Wesson and Glock, which donated 60 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistols, according to the group's Web site.
The site features a quote from a gun company executive praising the youth initiative and saying that ''anyone in the firearms industry that overlooks its potential is missing the boat.''
Larry Potterfield, the founder of MidwayUSA, one of the nation's largest sellers of shooting supplies and a major sponsor of the Scholastic Steel Challenge, said he did not fire a handgun until he was 21, adding that they ''are the most difficult guns to learn to shoot well.'' But, he said, he sees nothing wrong with children using them.
''Kids need arm strength and good patience to learn to shoot a handgun well,'' he said in an e-mail, ''and I would think that would come in the 12-14 age group for most kids.''
Another organization, the nonprofit Youth Shooting Sports Alliance, which was created in 2007, has received close to $1 million in cash, guns and equipment from the shooting sports foundation and firearms-related companies, including ATK, Winchester and Sturm, Ruger & Company, its tax returns show. In 2011, the alliance awarded 58 grants. A typical grant: 23 rifles, 4 shotguns, 16 cases of ammunition and other materials, which went to a Michigan youth camp.
The foundation and gun companies also support Junior Shooters magazine, which is based in Idaho and was started in 2007. The publication is filled with catchy advertisements and articles about things like zombie targets, pink guns and, under the heading ''Kids Gear,'' tactical rifle components with military-style features like pistol grips and collapsible stocks.
Gun companies often send new models to the magazine for children to try out with adult supervision. Shortly after Sturm, Ruger announced in 2009 a new, lightweight semiautomatic rifle that had the ''look and feel'' of an AR-15 but used less expensive .22-caliber cartridges, Junior Shooters received one for review. The magazine had three boys ages 14 to 17 fire it and wrote that they ''had an absolute ball!''
Junior Shooters' editor, Andy Fink, acknowledged in an editorial that some of his magazine's content stirred controversy.
''I have heard people say, even shooters that participate in some of the shotgun shooting sports, such things as, 'Why do you need a semiautomatic gun for hunting?' '' he wrote. But if the industry is to survive, he said, gun enthusiasts must embrace all youth shooting activities, including ones ''using semiautomatic firearms with magazines holding 30-100 rounds.''
In an interview, Mr. Fink elaborated. Semiautomatic firearms are actually not weapons, he said, unless someone chooses to hurt another person with them, and their image has been unfairly tainted by the news media. There is no legitimate reason children should not learn to safely use an AR-15 for recreation, he said.
''They're a tool, not any different than a car or a baseball bat,'' Mr. Fink said. ''It's no different than a junior shooting a .22 or a shotgun. The difference is in the perception of the viewer.''
The Weapon of Choice
The AR-15, the civilian version of the military's M-16 and M-4, has been aggressively marketed as a cool and powerful step up from more traditional target and hunting rifles. But its appearance in mass shootings -- in addition to Newtown, the gun was also used last year in the movie theater massacre in Aurora, Colo., and the attack on firefighters in Webster, N.Y. -- has prompted calls for tighter restrictions. The AR-15 is among the guns included in a proposed ban on a range of semiautomatic weapons that was introduced in the Senate last week.
Given the gun's commercial popularity, it is perhaps unsurprising that AR-15-style firearms have worked their way into youth shooting programs. At a ''Guns 'n Grillin'' weekend last fall, teenagers at a Boy Scout council in Virginia got to shoot AR-15s. They are used in youth competitions held each year at a National Guard camp in Ohio, and in ''junior clinics'' taught by Army or Marine marksmanship instructors, some of them sponsored by gun companies or organizations they support.
ArmaLite, a successor company to the one that developed the AR-15, is offering a similar rifle, the AR-10, for the grand prize in a raffle benefiting the Illinois State Rifle Association's ''junior high-power'' team, which uses AR-15s in its competitions. Bushmaster has offered on its Web site a coupon worth $350 off the price of an AR-15 ''to support and encourage junior shooters.''
Military-style firearms are prevalent in a target-shooting video game and mobile app called Point of Impact, which was sponsored by the shooting sports foundation and Guns & Ammo magazine. The game -- rated for ages 9 and up in the iTunes store -- allows players to shoot brand-name AR-15 rifles and semiautomatic handguns at inanimate targets, and it provides links to gun makers' Web sites as well as to the foundation's ''First Shots'' program, intended to recruit new shooters.
Upon the game's release in January 2011, foundation executives said in a news release that it was one of the industry's ''most unique marketing tools directed at a younger audience.'' Mr. Sanetti of the shooting sports foundation said sponsorship of the game was an experiment intended to deliver safety tips to players, while potentially generating interest in real-life sports.
The confluence of high-powered weaponry and youth shooting programs does not sit well even with some proponents of those programs. Stephan Carlson, a University of Minnesota environmental science professor whose research on the positive effects of learning hunting and outdoor skills in 4-H classes has been cited by the gun industry, said he ''wouldn't necessarily go along'' with introducing children to more powerful firearms that added nothing useful to their experience.
''I see why the industry would be pushing it, but I don't see the value in it,'' Mr. Carlson said. ''I guess it goes back to the skill base we're trying to instill in the kids. What are we preparing them for?''
For Mr. Potterfield of MidwayUSA, who said his own children started shooting ''boys' rifles'' at age 4, getting young people engaged with firearms -- provided they have the maturity and the physical ability to handle them -- strengthens an endangered American tradition.
Mr. Potterfield and his wife, Brenda, have donated more than $5 million for youth shooting programs in recent years, a campaign that he said was motivated by philanthropy, not ''return on investment.''
''Our gifting is pure benevolence,'' he said. ''We grew up and live in rural America and have owned guns, hunted and fished all of our lives. This is our community, and we hope to preserve it for future generations.''
Bearing Arms: This is the first in a series of articles that will examine the gun industry's influence and the wide availability of firearms in America.

For 2nd Time in a Week, Villanova Beats a Top-5 Team

BYLINE: By TIM ROHAN

PHILADELPHIA -- Villanova students huddled at the corners of the court, camera phones held high to record the moment and the Big East as they knew it. To remember Ryan Arcidiacono, whose last-second shot forced overtime. To remember James Bell, whose overtime shots sank No. 3 Syracuse.
When Villanova won, 75-71, on Saturday, the students trampled over their seats. Arcidiacono covered his head and braced himself. Someone tried to take his jersey. His teammates said their team prayer without him.
Somewhere in the crowd, Arcidiacono savored the moment -- Villanova's last regular-season conference game against Syracuse -- and jumped around for five minutes. 
''It was fun, but hopefully people know we don't need that anymore,'' he said afterward, also referring to a win over No. 5 Louisville on Tuesday, after which students rushed the court. ''We've got our two wins, so let's hope for the rest of these that we're expected to win. They don't have to rush the court.''
Villanova let it be known: the existing Big East would not die quietly. More like with a thunderous roar, same as the one that rang down when Arcidiacono pump-faked, took a half step forward and buried a tying 3-pointer from the corner with 2.2 seconds left in regulation.
Syracuse (18-2, 6-1) had held the lead, 61-55, and the ball with 3 minutes 20 seconds left, but Michael Carter-Williams and the Orange unraveled. Their lead, at that point, had been painful enough to build.
Carter-Williams, who led the nation in assists entering Saturday, had often taken on two, three, four defenders by himself. But Carter-Williams, C. J. Fair and Brandon Triche combined to miss 18 of their 24 shots in the first half.
Carter-Williams made it fine to the lane, to a forest of arms and hands, where layups were no guarantee. All game, the ball clinked and clanged around the rim, but it usually came out. Syracuse shot 33 percent over all, and Coach Jim Boeheim said, ''We missed a lot more layups than we have all year tonight.''
Triche was off, too, but in less than four minutes, he made four jumpers while scoring 10 points to help build that 61-55lead. When Boeheim seemed particularly upset with Carter-Williams, Triche, a senior, took control.
Just not at the end of regulation. Carter-Williams turned the ball over twice, and he missed a shot and a free throw -- the front end of a one-and-one -- just before Arcidiacono tied the score. Triche did not take a shot in the final 3:20, and Syracuse did not score.
''We started turning the ball over,'' Triche said, looking at the ground. ''We had the ball in the right people's hands.''
Across the locker room, Carter-Williams buried his face in a towel. He scored 17 points, but he also missed 13 shots and 6 free throws and had 5 turnovers.
Between both teams, only Villanova guard Darrun Hilliard shot well. By halftime, he had 15 points, and the Wildcats (13-7, 4-3) led, 32-26.
When Syracuse extended its 2-3 zone to pressure Hilliard, he smoothly drove to the basket. He finished with 25 points, 7 rebounds and 6 assists -- all career highs. Hilliard made two free throws to open overtime, and then Bell found his shot.
Bell had missed his previous eight shots -- including two free throws and two jumpers in overtime -- when he made a 3-pointer from the left corner. On the next possession, he made one from the right side, putting the Wildcats ahead, 69-65.
Villanova had a lead that it would not lose, and one more Big East memory it would not forget.
DUKE 84, MARYLAND 64 The freshman Rasheed Sulaimon scored a season-high 25 points, and No. 1 Duke (17-2, 4-2 Atlantic Coast Conference) bounced back from one of its worst losses under Mike Krzyzewski by routing visiting Maryland (15-5, 3-4). (AP)
KANSAS 67, OKLAHOMA 54 Ben McLemore scored 18 points, and No. 3 Kansas (18-1, 6-0 Big 12) shut down visiting Oklahoma (13-5, 4-2) to extend its winning streak to a nation-leading 17 games. (AP)
GEORGETOWN 53, LOUISVILLE 51 Otto Porter had 17 points and grabbed the game's decisive rebound with 1.4 seconds to play, leading host Georgetown (14-4, 4-3 Big East) over No. 5 Louisville (16-4, 4-3).
After getting the ball back on a disputed held ball ruling, the Cardinals kept it for a final shot. Peyton Siva missed the jumper, and Porter got the rebound and was fouled. (AP)
IOWA ST. 73, KANSAS ST. 67 Will Clyburn had 24 points and 10 rebounds, and host Iowa State (14-5, 4-2 Big 12) beat No. 11 Kansas State (15-4, 4-2), handing the Wildcats their second straight loss. (AP)
WISCONSIN 45, MINNESOTA 44 Barely beating the shot clock, Traevon Jackson hit a 15-foot jumper with four seconds left to lift host Wisconsin (14-6, 5-2 Big Ten) past No. 12 Minnesota (15-5, 3-4). Minnesota has lost four in a row.
After Jackson's shot gave the Badgers a 45-43 lead, Minnesota's Trevor Mbakwe was fouled. He was unable to shoot the ensuing free throws because of an apparent hand or wrist injury. Rodney Williams stepped to the line and made the first free throw but missed the second. (AP)
OHIO STATE 65, PENN STATE 51 Sam Thompson scored 16 points, and No. 14 Ohio State (15-4, 5-2 Big Ten) won at Penn State (8-12, 0-8). (AP)

Bloomberg to Johns Hopkins: Thanks a Billion (Well, $1.1 Billion)

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 1442 words

BALTIMORE -- He arrived on campus a middling high school student from Medford, Mass., who had settled for C's and had confined his ambitions to the math club.
But by the time Michael R. Bloomberg left Johns Hopkins University, with a smattering of A's and a lust for leadership, he was a social and political star -- the president of his fraternity, his senior class and the council overseeing Greek life. ''An all-around big man on campus,'' as he puts it.
His gratitude toward the university, starting with a $5 donation the year after he graduated, has since taken on a supersize, Bloombergian scale.
On Sunday, as he makes a $350 million gift to his alma mater -- by far the largest in its history -- the New York City mayor, along with the president of the university, will disclose the staggering sum of his donations to Johns Hopkins over the past four decades: $1.1 billion. 
That figure, kept quiet even as it transformed every corner of the university, makes Mr. Bloomberg the most generous living donor to any education institution in the United States, according to university officials and philanthropic tallies.
The timing of his latest donation, as the mayor's third term draws to a close, offers a glimpse of the sky-is-the-limit philanthropy that he and his aides say is likely to dominate his life after City Hall. The mayor, who is 70, has pledged to give away all of his $25 billion fortune before he dies, and he has built up a foundation on the Upper East Side of Manhattan to carry out the task.
At the same time, the donations highlight the unusually close relationship between Mr. Bloomberg and Johns Hopkins, which, interviews show, has played an unseen role in several of his biggest undertakings as mayor.
In an interview here, Mr. Bloomberg said he was making his donations public to encourage greater charitable giving toward education. He lamented, ''In our society, we are defunding education.''
The mayor, a member of the class of 1964, explained his fidelity to the university in deeply personal terms. Johns Hopkins, he said, was where he escaped the crushing boredom of Medford High and discovered an urban campus of stately Georgian buildings brimming with new people and ideas.
''I just thought I'd died and gone to heaven,'' he said.
''If I had been the son of academics,'' he added, ''maybe I would have been on campuses and would never have been as impressed as I was when I was here, because it's the first time I really was walking among people who were world leaders, who were creating, inventing.''
Johns Hopkins as it exists today is inconceivable without Mr. Bloomberg, whose giving has fueled major improvements in the university's reputation and rankings, its competitiveness for faculty and students, and the appearance of its campus.
His wealth -- not to mention a small army of his favored architects, art consultants and landscape designers -- has bankrolled and molded the handsome brick-and-marble walkways, lamps and benches that dot the campus; has constructed a physics building, a school of public health, a children's hospital, a stem-cell research institute, a malaria institute and a library wing; has commissioned giant art installations by Kendall Buster, Mark Dion and Robert Israel; and has financed 20 percent of all need-based financial aid grants to undergraduates over the past few years. (Even his ex-wife and in-laws make a campus cameo, on the dedication plaque for a science building he financed.)
''The modern story of Hopkins is inextricably linked to him,'' said Ronald J. Daniels, the university's president, as he walked around the campus recently. ''When you look at these great investments that have transformed American higher education, it's Rockefeller, it's Carnegie, it's Mellon, it's Stanford -- and it's Bloomberg.''
Hopkins, in return, has become something of a brain trust for Mr. Bloomberg, shaping his approach to issues like cigarette smoking, gun violence and obesity.
It was faculty members at Hopkins who introduced Mr. Bloomberg, as a donor and as a trustee, to a growing body of science linking behavior and disease.
''That is when he discovered public health,'' said Alfred Sommer, the dean of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health from 1990 until 2005.
At times, Mr. Bloomberg, then a high-flying entrepreneur, was resistant to paying for such research, arguing that some of the most intractable health problems were best left to government. ''That's policy; that's politics,'' Mr. Sommer recalled him saying.
But the underlying ideas stuck, and, as mayor, Mr. Bloomberg pressed the City Council to ban smoking in city parks, and the Board of Health to require fast-food chains to post calorie counts and restaurants to stop selling oversize sodas.
''He was in a position to act on things he had once told us we really shouldn't be bothered with,'' Mr. Sommer said. ''He has been the public health mayor ever since.''
Years before he would banish cars from parts of Times Square, Mr. Bloomberg removed them from the quads of Johns Hopkins as chairman of the board of trustees, arguing they were unsightly and impeded socializing. (To hide them, he paid for an underground parking garage.)
The relationship between Mr. Bloomberg and Hopkins is, much like the college admissions process, the product of happenstance.
In high school, Mr. Bloomberg worked at an electronics company whose owner happened to have a doctorate from the university. She urged him to apply, despite his mediocre transcript.
''Let's be serious -- they took a chance on me,'' Mr. Bloomberg said.
At Hopkins, the boyish-looking Mr. Bloomberg, whose high school classmates branded him ''argumentative'' in a class book, blossomed into a charismatic figure, eager to organize those around him. An engineering major, he persuaded his fraternity brothers to pay for a chef to replace a chaotic dinnertime routine, and he doled out assignments to lab mates. ''He was like the project manager, at 19 years old,'' Jim Kelly, a classmate, said.
On campus, Mr. Bloomberg discovered the addictive power of the limelight. When a local judge, tired of hearing cases involving misbehaving Hopkins fraternity brothers, called for an end to Greek life at the college, Mr. Bloomberg challenged him to an hourlong public debate. A healthy crowd showed up for the occasion.
''Mike not only held his own,'' Mr. Kelly recalled, ''he beat him.''
Mr. Bloomberg still relishes his star turn in campus governance. ''It's the first time that I ever headed something,'' he said. ''The first time I got a chance to pull people together.''
These days, his status as the university's top donor has given him mayorlike sway at Hopkins: deans routinely travel to New York to pitch him new programs and research.
His latest passion: genetically engineering mosquitoes to prevent the transmission of malaria. ''He always asks about the mosquitoes,'' said Dr. Peter Agre, a Nobel Prize-winning professor at the university, where Mr. Bloomberg has paid for a temperature-controlled center to cultivate the bugs. The mayor of New York City now speaks of ''building a better mosquito.''
Mr. Bloomberg tends to finance ideas that appeal to his contrarian style and corporate ethos. For years he has rotated top executives around his media company to encourage collaboration. In the hope of replicating that experience, most of his latest donation, about $250 million, will be used to hire 50 new faculty members who will hold appointments in two departments as they pursue research in areas like the global water supply and the future of American cities. (The remaining $100 million will be devoted to financial aid.)
His approach to philanthropy at the university is remarkablyhands-on. A trusted mayoral architectural adviser, Allen Kolkowitz, and an art guru, Nancy Rosen, guided the construction of the new Charlotte R. Bloomberg children's hospital, named for the mayor's mother. The building's colorful exterior is a whimsical take on Monet's paintings at Giverny. ''He got very involved in the design,'' said Dr. Edward D. Miller, the former chief executive of Hopkins Medicine.
Of course, certain courtesies are extended to a donor at Mr. Bloomberg's level. When Dr. Miller realized that the Charlotte R. Bloomberg Children's Center would be connected to a new tower named for Sheik Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahayan, the former president of the United Arab Emirates, he nervously called the mayor.
''Will you have a problem with this?'' he asked Mr. Bloomberg.
The mayor thanked him for the call, but made clear he had no objection. ''A Jew on one side, an Arab on the other,'' he told Dr. Miller. ''That's what we should do in this world.''

French Capture Strategic Airport in Move to Retake North Mali

BYLINE: By LYDIA POLGREEN and SCOTT SAYARE; Lydia Polgreen reported from Konna, and Scott Sayare from Paris. Elisabeth Bumiller contributed reporting from Washington.

KONNA, Mali -- French special forces took control of the airport in the Islamic rebel stronghold of Gao, the French government said Saturday, meeting ''serious resistance'' from militants even as they pressed northward.
Gao is one of three main northern cities in Mali that has been under rebel control for months, and the capture of the main strategic points in Gao represents the biggest prize yet in the battle to retake the northern half of the country.
French airstrikes have been pounding the city since France joined the fight at Mali's request on Jan. 11. French troops also took control of a bridge over the Niger River on Saturday, and the capture of the airport allowed a company of French soldiers to be airlifted in on Saturday afternoon, according to Col. Thierry Burkhard, the French military spokesman. 
Another French company was on the road to Gao from Sיvarי on Saturday night, and Malian and other African forces had begun to arrive, he said.
He stepped back from an earlier statement by the French Defense Ministry that declared the city freed by French forces, acknowledging that the statement was ''a bit overdone.'' Noting Gao's 70,000 inhabitants, he added, ''it's not with a detachment of special forces that you take over a city.''
But with reinforcements streaming in, the battle for Gao appeared imminent.
Soldiers from Chad and Niger are expected to arrive soon, the French defense minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, said in a statement. They will be part of a contingent of 1,900 African troops who have already arrived in Mali, fighting alongside the 2,500 French soldiers deployed here.
Gao's mayor, who had fled to Bamako, the capital, returned to his city on Saturday, Mr. Le Drian said.
In Washington, the Pentagon said Saturday that the United States would provide aerial refueling for French warplanes. The decision increases American involvement, which until now had consisted of transporting French troops and equipment and also providing intelligence, including satellite photographs.
Gao, 600 miles northeast of the capital, had been under the control of the Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa, a splinter group of Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb.
Al Jazeera broadcast a statement from Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb in which the group said it had withdrawn temporarily from some cities it held, but would return with greater force.
Little information has come from the other two main cities under rebel control -- Timbuktu, the fabled desert oasis, and Kidal, northeast of Gao -- for the past 10 days because mobile phone networks have been down.
Konna was overrun by Islamic fighters on Jan. 10, prompting France to intervene, and a clearer picture has begun to emerge of the fighting. Residents and officials here said that at least 11 civilians had been killed in French airstrikes.
Charred husks of pickup trucks lined the road into the town, and broken tanks and guns littered the fish market, where the rebels appeared to have set up a temporary base.
Because of France's sudden entry into the fray, the United Nations and the regional trade bloc known as Ecowas, the Economic Community of West African States, have been scrambling to put together an African-led intervention force that has been in the planning stages. The Mali Army, which has struggled to fight the Islamist groups, has been accused of serious human rights violations.
From Konna, it is easy to see why the Malian government pleaded for French help after the Islamist fighters took control of the town. Just 35 miles of asphalt separate Konna from the garrison town of Sיvarי, home to the second-biggest airfield in Mali and a vital strategic point for any foreign intervention force.
Residents said their town fell to the rebels when 300 pickup trucks of fighters, bristling with machine guns, rolled in and pushed back the Malian Army troops who had been guarding the town after a fierce battle.
Amadou Traore, 29, a tire repairman, said residents had heard that the Islamist rebels had surrounded the town before the attack, but he had been confident that the army would keep them at bay.
''We thought there was no way for them to enter into the town,'' he said. ''But they came in the night. They told us, 'Tomorrow we will go to Sיvarי.' ''
A woman who lived in his compound was hit by a bullet, he said. They tried to take her to the town clinic, but the doctor had fled. ''After two days, she died,'' Mr. Traore said.
Baro Coulibaly fled her house along the main road into town, moving with her husband and six children to the relative safety of the town center, where they stayed with her in-laws for days. They heard French bombs and rebel bullets ricocheting around the mud-walled dwellings.
''Nobody could get in or out,'' Ms. Coulibaly said. ''We were so afraid we barely ate or slept.''
Residents said they heard that the fearsome Tuareg leader of the Islamist group Ansar Dine, Iyad ag Ghali, had led the attack on their town, but no one saw him. The rebels spoke many languages, the residents said. Some were light-skinned Arabs and Tuaregs, a nomadic people, while others were dark-skinned people who spoke the local languages of Niger, Nigeria and Mali.
Boubacar Diallo, a local political leader, said that only a few rebel fighters came at first. Later, hundreds more joined them, overwhelming the Malian soldiers based here. He said he never saw them pray and scoffed at their assertion that they would teach the Muslim population a purer form of Islam.
''They say they are Muslims, but I don't know any Muslim who does not pray,'' Mr. Diallo said.
The fighters took down the Malian flag and raised a banner of their own, a white piece of paper printed with words in Arabic -- ''Assembly for the Spiritual Ideology to Purify the African World'' -- and pictures of machine guns.
After the Islamist fighters fled, Mr. Diallo took it down and replaced it with the Malian flag.

Williams Starts Fast, But Pace Suits Rockets

BYLINE: By ZACH SCHONBRUN

HOUSTON -- There was a point Saturday when Deron Williams's shooting touch was so scorching that his teammates flatly avoided him, the way they might recede from a bowler edging toward a 300 game. As the first quarter ended, and Williams still had not missed, there was a sense he might be on the verge of something spectacular.
Williams and Houston's Jeremy Lin have a history, a seesawing battle of one-upmanship. On Saturday, it may have had a lot to do with Williams's sizzling start. But by the game's end, Lin was being cheered, Williams had been ejected, and the Nets had stalked off with their second lopsided loss in two nights, falling by 119-106 at Toyota Center. 
The Nets went from facing one of the league's staunchest defensive teams, the Memphis Grizzlies, to trying to keep up with its fastest, the Rockets, who led the league in possessions per game (100.4) and were third in scoring average (104.1) entering Saturday's game. The end results were largely the same.
Before the game, Coach P. J. Carlesimo indicated that the Nets' success would hinge on their ability to slow the Rockets to a more deliberate pace. Instead, the Nets fell victim to the early defensive sluggishness that cost them in a blowout loss the night before.
''We're just getting annihilated in points in the paint,'' Carlesimo said. ''We need to get some better individual defense, and we certainly need team defense.''
On Saturday, there was hardly enough of either. The Rockets outscored the Nets by 60-24 in the paint and by 27-7 in transition.
''We got into an up-tempo game; that's not our style,'' forward Gerald Wallace said. ''We run, but this is just a transition team. That's not the style we wanted to play.''
Paced early by Williams, who hit his first seven shots, the Nets were ahead, 29-28, going into the second quarter. Williams either scored or assisted on the Nets' first 22 points.
But he got little support.
Then the Rockets took off, starting the second quarter on a 25-6 run. They got assists on 17 of their first 20 field goals.
''Tonight we were able to go inside, drive inside, get our big men easy buckets,'' said Lin, who finished with 14 points and 9 assists.
The Nets cut the deficit to 9 with a stronger showing in the third quarter, making five 3-pointers and not committing a turnover. But the Rockets pulled away again in the fourth. Omer Asik, their center, had 20 points and 16 rebounds.
After Memphis's Marc Gasol and Zach Randolph had their way with the Nets' frontcourt on Friday, Saturday's effort did little to ease concerns about the team.
''Maybe we're a step slow,'' Brook Lopez said. ''I don't know if I'm communicating enough, or contesting enough, but we definitely got to change some things and get back to what we were doing.''
Williams scored 38 points against Lin and the Knicks last February, less than three weeks after Lin embarrassed the Nets with 25 points off the bench in the precursor to Linsanity. It was clear Williams had not forgotten about either game.
But frustration boiled over late in the fourth, when Williams was ejected for arguing with the official David Jones. Williams finished with 27 points and 11 assists, but he declined to speak with members of the news media after the game.
The Rockets are fighting out of a lengthy mid-month funk, following a stretch in which they had won 10 of 12. Their coach, Kevin McHale, acknowledged that the team was still learning a new system.
''We like the style we play when the ball moves,'' McHale said before the game. ''And we're not very good when it doesn't.''
The backcourt of James Harden, named an All-Star last week, and Lin has shown signs of flash, but at times has also fizzled. The Rockets lead the league in transition scoring and possessions per game, but also in turnovers.
''Everybody wants to believe in a microwave society, where everything works in three days,'' McHale said. ''But it takes time.''
Carlesimo was reluctant to say that his players were slowed by fatigue in their fourth game in six days. He praised the Rockets' ability to run their offense skillfully.
''It's an extremely good offensive team and it's not an accident the stuff they do,'' Carlesimo said.

The Preppers Next Door

BYLINE: By ALAN FEUER

SECTION: Section MB; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 2572 words

A couple of weeks ago, on a leisurely Sunday afternoon, 40 people gathered at a church in Washington Heights for a show-and-tell session sponsored by the New York City Preppers Network. One by one, they stood in front of the room and exhibited their ''bug-out bags,'' meticulously packed receptacles filled with equipment meant to see them through the collapse of civilization.
Onto a folding table came a breathtaking array of disaster swag: compasses and iodine pills, hand-cranked radios and solar-powered flashlights, magnesium fire-starters and a fully charged Kindle with digital road maps of the tristate region. Many of the items on display went far beyond the ''10 Basic Pillars of Bug-Out Gear'' that Jason Charles, the network's leader, had passed out in advance through the Internet. A good number were tweaked to fit their owners' needs and interests. A locksmith in the group had a lock-picking set. A vegetarian had a stash of homemade dehydrated lentils. One man had a condom designed to serve as an emergency canteen; another had a rat trap -- to catch and eat the rats. 
After showing off his own bag (parachute cord, a bivy sack, a two-week supply of Meals Ready to Eat), Mr. Charles, a New York City firefighter, told the group that he had just bought a dog. ''So now I have to implement his plan, too,'' he said a little worriedly. With a pause and a sheepish look, he added, ''That's weird, right?''
New York hardly seems like a natural location for what has become known as the prepper movement, but in fact the city's prepping community is not only large and remarkably diverse, its leaders say, it's also growing rapidly.
To the unprepared, the very word ''prepper'' is likely to summon images of armed zealots hunkered down in bunkers awaiting the End of Days, but the reality, at least here in New York, is less dramatic. Local Preppers are doctors, doormen, charter school executives, subway conductors, advertising writers and happily married couples from the Bronx. They are no doubt people that you know -- your acquaintances and neighbors. People, I'll admit, like myself.
It isn't easy being a Prepper these days. The discipline has taken blows from TV programs like ''Doomsday Preppers,'' which -- despite its record ratings and recent episodes, like ''Escape From New York'' -- is more or less a weekly invitation to laugh at lunatics tunneling into mountainsides to escape a Russian nuclear attack. Last month, a chill went through the movement when it turned out that the mother of Adam Lanza, the shooter in the Newtown, Conn., killings, was a Prepper. Even though prepping is increasingly visible in the culture -- through meet-up groups, books, films and weekend retreats at which canning skills are learned -- it continues to be thought of as a marginal and unseemly business, something on par with believing that the Bilderberg Group controls world events or that the government is hiding aliens at Area 51.
MY OWN ATTEMPTS at prepping started at a point between the fall of Lehman Brothers and the corresponding rise of quantitative easing, when it occurred to me -- as, of course, it did to many -- that the financial system was appallingly unstable and that the realm of the possible now included a disruptive reduction in the value of our money. Egged on by admittedly heated readings of doomsday authors like John Mauldin and Charles Hugh Smith, I began to form a picture of the world as a system of unsustainable systems, a rickety Rube Goldberg machine in which the loss of any one piece -- cheap oil, say -- could derail the whole contraption, from truck transportation to the distribution of food.
In the wake of these insights, I called a family friend in Ohio, himself half-a-Prepper, and he advised me to purchase a quantity of Silver Eagle coins as an inflation hedge, which I did. Not long after came the hundred-dollar, home-delivered month's supply of freeze-dried food -- in the standard and the vegetarian options -- from Costco.com. I bought my wife, which is to say, myself, John Seymour's homesteading classic, ''The Self-Sufficient Life and How to Live It.'' I began the conversation about acquiring a gun.
While close friends visiting my home might be allowed a look at my haphazard bug-out bag, I mostly kept quiet about prepping, aware of the embarrassment I was courting. It was, therefore, with a measure of relief that I found myself this month among brethren Preppers who intuitively understood my desire to have at hand a packed supply of power bars or a LifeStraw personal drinking tool. You do meet Preppers in New York who are preparing for extreme events like solar flares or an eruption of the Yellowstone Caldera, but most say their concerns are more immediate, more local: chief among them being terrorist attacks, natural disasters and economic collapse.
''The Earth isn't going to crash into Planet X and the Mayan thing never happened'' is how Mr. Charles put it when I introduced myself at the show-and-tell. ''But I'll tell you this,'' he added. ''People here definitely used their preps during Sandy.''
Not surprisingly, the storm attracted numerous recruits to his group and joined a list of totemic prepping moments that already included the much-hyped Y2K fiasco, 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina. I learned that New York Preppers prep for reasons as varied as their anxieties and experience. ''It was a pragmatic response to certain things I know,'' said Robert Segal, a wine salesman between jobs, who once worked as an electrical technician on a nuclear submarine. ''As an engineer, I'm sort of a student of how things fall apart.''
I found this practicality attractive. I liked how Preppers were given to debate (bear spray or baseball bats? Water purification or water filtration?) and how they were versed in esoteric areas of knowledge (fish antibiotics, New York City knife laws). I was especially enamored of the jargon: ''GOOD'' (Get Out of Dodge) or ''TEOTWAWKI'' (The End of the World as We Know It). And yet, I must confess, there were moments that gave me pause.
During his presentation, Mr. Charles suggested that a well-prepared bug-out bag was only part of the equation; just as important was knowing where to go. ''Bugging out will not be easy,'' he explained. ''It might take three or four hours to get out of the city. If the bridges are blocked, you might have to use a raft to get across the river. Everyone's situation will be different.''
Then, as the show-and-tell ended, he gave the prize for Best Bag to a precocious young Prepper whose kit included a fishing line, a seat belt cutter, ready-start fuel cubes, several types of multi-tools and a smoke hood. The winner had come with his mother and had dutifully prepared a bag for her. I wanted to talk with him, but when I approached, he asked if I was ''press'' and suspiciously refused to give his name.
I later found out that he was 12.
EARLY IN MY TRAVELS, I was told the man to see for a deeper understanding of prepping in New York was Aton Edwards, founder of the International Preparedness Network and author of the emergency survival guide ''Preparedness Now!'' Mr. Edwards, 51, is often called the city's foremost expert in personal disaster preparation -- he has appeared on the ''Today'' show, has taught his ''Ready Up!'' seminars to hundreds of participants with partners like the Red Cross and has set up, as part of the National Urban Self-Reliance and Preparedness Program, ''incident command centers'' across New York, like the one he recently created for the hip-hop pioneer Afrika Bambaataa in the Bronx.
Mr. Edwards has sufficient recognition in the prepping world that just last month someone calling himself Hudson Valley Prepper left a message on Preppergroups.com warning that one day in the not-too-distant future he might head north. ''This guy Aton Edwards,'' the message read, ''a dangerous man in his own right, is currently holding prepper training in New York City and has stated that the number one goal is to get out of the city. Do you think you could stop Aton and his followers once he has been on the road for a week and is starving?''
When I met Mr. Edwards in Brooklyn this month, I found a hulking man dressed entirely in black, sitting in front of a laptop and giving an Internet tutorial on bug-out-bag preparedness to members of Evolver. net, the ''global community of cultural creatives'' established by Daniel Pinchbeck, a proponent of last year's Mayan apocalypse phenomenon. In between displaying items like his Chinese-made survival shovel with the saw blade and nail-puller, Mr. Edwards said: ''Daniel just wants his people to be ready. Even if you're cosmically conscious, you still need to prepare for what it'll be like with no food or water.''
As I got to know him better, Mr. Edwards told me the story of his own interest in disaster preparation, which began, he said, in 1972, when he went to see ''Deliverance'' on the Grand Concourse in the Bronx. (''I thought it was a camping movie.'') He entered the theater as a relatively normal 10-year-old, but emerged as a Prepper: ''I said to myself, 'Gee, I should get to learning everything possible to prevent that situation from occurring.' ''
Acquiring skills over the next two decades from military manuals and from Soldier of Fortune magazine, he said he went one day to a course in civil defense hosted by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and recalled being horrified that the government was still relying on ''cold war supplies of vienna sausages and five-pound bags of sugar.'' His disillusionment led in 1989 to the founding of I.P.N., which seeks to train civilians to be ready for emergencies like cyber attacks and flu pandemics.
It was not by chance, Mr. Edwards said, that prepping first took root in New York in the black community: he himself is black, and in the 1990s he became a frequent guest on ''The Open Line,'' a call-in radio show on the ''urban adult'' station WBLS. Around the same time, he started giving classes in disaster preparation at the National Action Network, the Rev. Al Sharpton's civil rights group. ''Obviously,'' Mr. Edwards said, ''because of our history, black folks know that bad things happen.''
These days, he added, the prepping movement is ''the strangest mishmash of people you could ever find -- black, white, men, women, everyone. It looks like America.''
In his professional opinion, the next big development in prepping will be the arrival of entrepreneurial capitalists, and this made me think of Fabian Illanes and Roman Zrazhevskiy, two men in their 20s I met at the show-and-tell. Former classmates at George H. Hewlett High School on Long Island, Mr. Illanes and Mr. Zrazhevskiy have been prepping since their teens and recently created Readytogosurvival.com, a Prepper Web site that sells prepacked bug-out bags with paramilitary names like the Tactical Traveler ($439.99) and the Covert Defender ($629.99). They told me that they had been visiting Prepper meetings across the New York region in order ''to discover their customers.''
Mr. Edwards has also entered the Prepper market, and one day I accompanied him to Westchester to observe a consultation he was doing (at $120 an hour) for Jeff and Joanna Lee Doster, a couple in their 50s recently transplanted from Manhattan. The Dosters -- he is a retired marketing executive, and she is the author of ''Celebrity Bedroom Retreats'' -- found themselves without a home during Hurricane Sandy after the poorly timed sale of their apartment on West 57th Street.
''We felt so helpless,'' Ms. Doster said as we arrived. ''That's why we called Aton.''
After examining their new house -- ''Decent elevation, but not too solar-friendly'' -- Mr. Edwards issued his analysis. The Dosters rely on electric power for their heat and water, and given the prevalence of long winter power failures in their town, Mr. Edwards recommended a 60-gallon Aquatank water-storage mattress for under the bed. He also suggested at least 10 boxes of Nuvona emergency food and advised the couple to invest in two electric bicycles, energy-saving lights (''If you want to get jiggy with it, try the LEDs'') and a rooftop windmill for alternate generation.
''Now your worst-case scenario is that something goes down at Indian Point,'' he said, referring to the nuclear reactor in Buchanan, N.Y., 30 minutes away. ''You're in the peak-injury zone. You'd get a pretty serious dose of radioactive particulates.''
The Dosters looked terrified.
''The good part?'' Mr. Edwards reassured them. ''This is a rental.''
PREPPING IS THE BIG SHORT: a bet not just against a city, or a country or a government, but against the whole idea of sustainable civilization. For that reason, it chafes against one of polite society's last remaining taboos -- that the way we live is not simply plagued by certain problems, but is itself insolubly problematic.
It seemed important to know if this all-encompassing negativity was histrionic or appropriate -- that is, if the hard-core Preppers I had met were crazy or were, in fact, on to something. Just before the show-and-tell, I came across a news report about Dr. Irwin Redlener, the director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University, whom Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo had recently named to lead a commission investigating how ready the state was for another Hurricane Sandy-like emergency. I arranged an interview, figuring that he, if anyone, could answer my question.
Although he had a cold when we met at his office in Harlem, Dr. Redlener was a soothing presence -- bearded, erudite and open to the notion that ordinary people have a central role in emergency preparedness. The government, he told me, reacted decisively after 9/11, establishing the Department of Homeland Security, so why shouldn't everyday citizens react?
''It's impossible to forget that we live in a world vulnerable to hazards, man-made and natural,'' he said. ''So it's legitimate to ask: What is the impact on individuals?''
His answer was squarely in line with Prepper doctrine. Dr. Redlener said it was rational -- indeed, it was recommended -- to have a three-day supply of food and water, a working flashlight, a first-aid kit, a radio that runs without batteries and a plan in place to rejoin one's relatives after a disaster. He talked about situational awareness, a major Prepper mantra. ''A prepared citizen is someone who understands how to take care of himself,'' he said, ''who has amassed the necessary items, who has a plan.''
When I asked about some of those I had met along the way -- say, the geared-up 12-year-old, Leonardo Ruiz Jr., who, dropping his suspicions, later gave his name to a photographer -- he gave a forbearing smile. ''There's a spectrum,'' Dr. Redlener said. ''On one end is mindless complacency. On the other is paranoia. The challenge is to find that place in the middle where you understand that bad things can happen, but it doesn't consume your life.''
Then he surprised me. I had never heard even a quasi-government official admit that the authorities would not respond promptly in an emergency, but Dr. Redlener said that ''gaps'' existed during ''mega-disasters,'' hours, even days, when there might not be an official response.
''The well-being of many, many people in harm's way will be dependent in those gaps on social networks, on community and on individual preparedness,'' he said.
He added, aphoristically, ''We are all first responders.''

New Hampshire Police Chiefs Hold a 31-Gun Raffle for a Training Program

BYLINE: By JESS BIDGOOD

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 12

NEWPORT, N.H. -- When the New Hampshire Association of Chiefs of Police was looking to raise money for an annual cadet training program, it sold raffle tickets for $30 apiece. The drawing was scheduled for May, but by Jan. 12 all 1,000 tickets had been sold.
The prize: 31 guns, with a new winner drawn each day of the month. 
The fund-raiser, sponsored by the association in partnership with two New Hampshire gun makers, Sig Sauer and Sturm, Ruger & Company, has prompted a chorus of protests from lawmakers and gun-control advocates questioning why the police are giving away guns, even in the name of a good cause.
Some in law enforcement have also raised questions. When Chief Nicholas J. Giaccone Jr. of Hanover pulled up information about the raffle on the Internet, he said, he was flabbergasted.
''I looked at the first weapon and Googled that one,'' said Chief Giaccone, who recalled using an expletive when he pulled up information about the Ruger SR-556C, a semiautomatic weapon. ''It's an assault rifle.''
In a letter to the editor of The Eagle-Tribune, which covers southern New Hampshire, Richard J. O'Shaughnessy of Salem wrote, ''People who should know better are adding to the glorification of the gun culture in this state.''
And referring to the shootings last month at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, State Representative Sharon L. Nordgren, a Hanover Democrat, said, ''They're just the same kind that were used in Newtown.''
The Ruger that caught Chief Giaccone's attention is an AR-15-style rifle, which is the most popular style of gun in America, according to dealers, and was the type used by Adam Lanza to kill 20 children and six adults at the elementary school. Another gun in the raffle, the Sig Sauer P226 handgun, was also carried by Mr. Lanza, according to the Connecticut State Police.
''It's just ironic that that would be their choice of the kind of gun that they're raffling,'' Ms. Nordgren said.
Organizers of the raffle are standing firm. In a statement released this month, Chief Paul T. Donovan of Salem, the president of the association, defended the fund-raiser, saying that all winners would be required to meet all applicable rules for gun ownership.
''While this raffle falls on the heels of the recent tragedy in Newtown, Conn., the New Hampshire Association of Chiefs of Police extends their deepest sympathies to the families and first responders,'' Chief Donovan wrote. ''New Hampshire Chiefs of Police feel the issues with these tragic shootings are ones that are contrary to lawful and responsible gun ownership.''
The proceeds from the raffle go toward a cadet program involving participants ages 14 to 20 who are given instructions in various kinds of police skills and procedures. Some of them go on to pursue careers in law enforcement.
The guns will be distributed through another raffle partner, Rody's Gun Shop, a windowless outpost here in Newport, a town that comes to life when employees of Ruger, which is one of its main employers, leave work for the day.
''Around here, most people are into guns,'' said Michael Gaffney, an employee of a nearby hardware store who won a rifle in a raffle years ago. ''You get a chance to win a free gun! It's like any raffle, very much akin to trailer raffles, snowmobile raffles or turkey raffles.''
On a recent weeknight, the Rody's parking lot was filled with idling cars, their occupants waiting for the store to open at 6 o'clock. The store filled up immediately. Customers, some with their children in tow, browsed the shotguns and rifles on the walls and discussed the possibility of gun bans. While the shop's owner would not comment on the raffle, his customers were nonchalant.
''Honestly, I don't see what the big deal is -- they're just talking about it because of Sandy Hook,'' said Lorraine Peterson of Litchfield. ''I don't mean to sound insensitive. This is New Hampshire. This is a sport.''
Gun raffles are business as usual here and in many other parts of the country -- frequently used by hunting clubs and sometimes by athletics booster clubs to raise money and anchor galas.
''We host raffles like this all the time,'' said Richard Olson Jr., the president of the New Hampshire Wildlife Federation and the Londonderry Fish and Game Club. ''Anybody that's speaking up is using the Newtown massacre as a pretext to poke at the issue negatively.''
Mr. Olson said that he once planned a gun raffle to raise money for a fishing derby and that he was considering using one to raise money for the wildlife federation's conservation efforts on New England cottontail rabbits.
Shifting economic and political conditions have spread gun raffles to other spheres, too. Josh Harms, a Republican state representative in Illinois, intends to raffle three guns in March to raise money for his campaign treasury.
Greg Hay, a firefighter from Quincy, Ill., said his union decided last January to hold a gun raffle to replenish its accounts after a drawn-out arbitration. He said the sluggish economy had limited fund-raising from the union's annual country music concert.
''We didn't really want to have any more assessments, so we needed to start looking at better moneymakers,'' said Mr. Hay, who expects the union, Quincy Firefighters Local 63, to take home about $25,000 from the raffle, which started last June and awards one gun per week for a year.
The fund-raiser has been so successful that the union had planned to sponsor a second one until a recent increase in gun prices -- fueled by increased demand amid fears of gun bans in the wake of the Newtown shooting -- made the effort less promising.
''Maybe we'll hold off until gun prices go down and start to go back to a decent level,'' Mr. Hay said.
Opponents of the raffle in New Hampshire are quick to say it is not the guns they oppose, but the fact that the police are conducting it.
''I think in some respects it shows the wrong message,'' said State Representative Stephen Shurtleff, Democrat of Merrimack. ''For law enforcement, normally they're dealing with firearms in a negative way. For that reason, it's just not an appropriate thing. We're trying to get guns off the street.''

What We Don't Know Is Killing Us

SECTION: Section SR; Column 0; Editorial Desk; EDITORIAL | THE GUN CHALLENGE; Pg. 10

LENGTH: 865 words

In one of the 23 executive orders on gun control signed this month, President Obama instructed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other federal science agencies to conduct research into the causes and prevention of gun violence. He called on Congress to aid that effort by providing $10 million for the C.D.C. in the next budget round and $20 million to expand the federal reporting system on violent deaths to all 50 states, from the current 18.
That Mr. Obama had to make such a decree at all is a measure of the power of the gun lobby, which has effectively shut down government-financed research on gun violence for 17 years. Research on guns is crucial to any long-term effort to reduce death from guns. In other words, treat gun violence as a public health issue. 
But that is precisely what the National Rifle Association and other opponents of firearms regulation do not want. In the absence of reliable data and data-driven policy recommendations, talk about guns inevitably lurches into the unknown, allowing abstractions, propaganda and ideology to fill the void and thwart change.
The research freeze began at a time when the C.D.C. was making strides in studying gun violence as a public health problem. Before that, the issue had been regarded mainly as a law enforcement challenge or as a problem of disparate acts by deranged offenders, an approach that remains in sync with the N.R.A. worldview.
Public health research emphasizes prevention of death, disability and injury. It focuses not only on the gun user, but on the gun, in much the same way that public health efforts to reduce motor vehicle deaths have long focused on both drivers and cars.
The goal is to understand a health threat and identify lifesaving interventions. At their most basic, gun policy recommendations would extend beyond buying and owning a gun (say, background checks and safe storage devices) to manufacturing (childproofing and other federal safety standards) and distribution (stronger antitrafficking laws), as well as educating and enlisting parents, physicians, teachers and other community leaders to talk about the risks and responsibilities of gun ownership.
But by the early 1990s, C.D.C. gun research had advanced to the point that it contradicted N.R.A. ideology. Some studies found, for example, that people living in a home with a gun were not safer; they faced a significantly elevated risk of homicide and suicide.
The N.R.A. denounced the research as ''political opinion masquerading as medical science,'' and in 1996, Congress took $2.6 million intended for gun research and redirected it to traumatic brain injury. It prohibited the use of C.D.C. money ''to advocate or promote gun control.'' Since then, similar prohibitions have been imposed on other agencies, including the National Institutes of Health.
Technically, the prohibition is not a ban on all research, but the law has cast a pall that even prominent foundations and academic centers cannot entirely overcome. That is in part because comprehensive public health efforts require systematic data gathering and analysis, the scale and scope of which is a government undertaking. To understand and prevent motor vehicle deaths, for instance, the government tracks more than 100 variables per fatal crash, including the make, model and year of the vehicles, the speed and speed limit, the location of passengers, seat belt use and air bag deployment.
Guns deaths do not get such scrutiny. That does not mean we do not know enough to act. The evidence linking gun prevalence and violent death is strong and compelling; international comparisons are also instructive.
But we need more data to formulate, analyze and evaluate policy to focus on what works and to refine or reject what does not. How many guns are stolen? How do guns first get diverted into illegal hands? How many murderers would have passed today's background checks? What percentage of criminal gun traces are accounted for by, say, the top 5 percent of gun dealers? How many households possess firearms: is it one-third as some surveys suggest, or one-half?
The gun lobby is likely to claim that any federally financed gun research, per se, is banned by law, a charge that would force debate of whether evidence-based policy recommendations are tantamount to lobbying. Or the C.D.C. may choose to focus on data collection and leave the policy recommendations to outside researchers. That would be a sorry situation for government scientists, but an improvement over the status quo.
It is obvious that gun violence is a public health threat. A letter this month to Vice President Joseph Biden Jr.'s gun violence commission from more than 100 researchers in public health and related fields pointed out that mortality rates from almost every major cause of death have declined drastically over the past half century. Motor vehicle deaths per mile driven in America have fallen by more than 80 percent. But the homicide rate in the United States, driven by guns, is almost exactly the same as it was in 1950.
This is part of a continuing series on the epidemic of gun violence and possible solutions. Other editorials are at nytimes.com/gunchallenge.

Dozens Killed in Clashes At a Venezuelan Prison

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN and GIRISH GUPTA; William Neuman reported from Caracas, and Girish Gupta from Barquisimeto, Venezuela.

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 8

LENGTH: 548 words

CARACAS, Venezuela -- Dozens of people have been killed in fierce clashes between inmates and National Guard soldiers at a Venezuelan prison, local news media accounts said Saturday.
It was the latest in a series of riots over the past year in overcrowded prisons, where guns and drugs abound and inmates control many aspects of life. 
Newspapers initially reported that more than 50 people had been killed at the Uribana prison in Barquisimeto, a northwestern city, citing the director of a hospital where the wounded and the dead were taken. Later Saturday, the director, Ruy Medina, said that the number of dead had risen to 61, and that 120 people had been injured, The Associated Press reported. He said nearly all the wounds were from gunshots.
The minister of prisons, Iris Varela, said the violence broke out Friday when troops entered the prison to search for weapons and establish order.
The situation remained chaotic on Saturday. Local news media reports said that most of the dead were prisoners.
''We are all afraid because we don't want to die,'' said a man who identified himself as an inmate inside the prison when reached Saturday by cellphone; it is typical for inmates here to have phones.
The 27-year-old inmate, imprisoned on a robbery charge, asked not to be identified for fear that speaking out could put him at risk. He said that many of the inmates remained inside the prison, although the dead and badly wounded had been removed.
''We are hiding here, waiting to find out what happens to us, for them to help us,'' he said.
The prison violence poses a new test for the government as President Hugo Chבvez remains in Cuba, where he has been for more than six weeks undergoing treatment for cancer. Top officials have been trying to show that the government is running smoothly, even as they grapple with uncertainty about the president's health, a constitutional dispute over the start of his new term, shortages of basic goods and signs of resurgent inflation.
''There was a tragic situation of confusion that we lament very much,'' Vice President Nicolבs Maduro said Saturday, promising an investigation. He spoke after returning from Cuba, where he had gone to visit Mr. Chבvez.
Ms. Varela said that officials decided to conduct the raid after receiving information that violence had increased between inmate factions vying for control.
But she said that word of the operation leaked out and that it was reported by a television station, a local newspaper and social networking sites.
Ms. Varela called the reports ''a detonator of the violence.'' She said that the dead had wounds from knives, firearms and explosives, and that some were killed before the troops arrived.
The Venezuelan Prison Observatory, a human rights group, said 560 prisoners were killed in the nation's prisons in 2011.
Last year, two major episodes left dozens dead: 25 people were killed at one prison, the government said, and 30 died in another, the Prison Observatory said.
Outside the Barquisimeto prison and a hospital on Saturday, hundreds of people, mostly inmates' relatives, waited for news.
''This happens all the time and nothing changes,'' said Yolanda Rodrםguez, 57, who was waiting for information about her 24-year-old son, an inmate. ''We know nothing about what's happening inside.''

RAGE IS BACKBy Adam Mansbach
290 pp. Viking. $26.95.
When I first came to live in New York, in 1976, I was enthralled by the graffiti in the subways. It seemed a language from some secret world beneath the city, letters that were barely letters, shaped by hands you never saw: a call to resistance, maybe, notes from the underground.
Looking at pictures of it now -- particularly the graffiti scrawled inside the cars -- I admit it's hard not to see it as many of my fellow New Yorkers did then, as signs of a city out of control, defaced and defeated. But I suspect that's an old man's concession. Real art was written on the subway cars, and it was a sign of defiant life, not decay.
Would that the same could be said for Adam Mansbach's fictional tribute to that vanished world, ''Rage Is Back.'' This is the eighth book written or edited by Mansbach, known mostly for his best-selling kids' book satire, ''Go the ____ to Sleep,'' but ''Rage Is Back'' is uneven, flashing bits of brilliance like a beautifully burned train clacking over a few minutes of elevated rail only to vanish into a labyrinth of digressions and affectations. 
The premise is straightforward enough. Mansbach's hero and narrator, Kilroy Dondi Vance -- his name a lovely amalgam of graffiti artists and subject -- is a contemporary mixed-race Brooklyn teenager who has grown up without a father. To celebrate his birth, Dad, a half-Jewish graffiti star whose tag is Billy Rage, went out with his fabulous multiracial crew, ''the Immortal Five,'' to ''bomb'' the Coney Island train yard.
There, they ran smack into a brutal, graffiti-hating M.T.A. police captain, a Rudy Giuliani stand-in named Anastacio Bracken. Tragedy ensued, as the Five proved all too mortal. Their most vulnerable member, Amuse, was coldly murdered by Bracken, and others soon fell victim to suicide, prison and inexplicable blindness. Billy Rage, after a desperate two-year campaign to publicize his friend's murder by bombing everything he can think of with the slogan BRACKEN KILLED AMUSE -- including a Central Park polar bear -- fled the city to parts unknown, a likely prison sentence and a $2 million civil judgment hanging over his head.
Now it's 2005, 18 years after the Coney Island showdown, and Bracken is the head of the M.T.A. and running for mayor. Billy has surfaced, too, raving mad at first, but determined to stop Bracken and avenge his friend. Dondi, his son, isn't sure how he feels about any of this. He's adrift, having just been thrown out of both his mother's apartment and his exclusive private school, and filled with resentment toward his long-absent father. But soon the whole family Rage, plus the surviving Immortals and graffiti fiends everywhere, have come together in a scheme to stop Bracken's candidacy by painting a psychedelic J'accuse on every train in the system.
Whatever promise this plot may have held is undermined by a sort of literary attention deficit disorder. Mansbach's characters tend to be as thin as rolling papers, and people and plot points alike are dropped and forgotten for little reason. Even Bracken, the chief villain, barely appears in the book. Elsewhere, Billy Rage tells one of his best friends he can ''fix'' his blindness with herbs he picked up in the Amazon. The friend sounds eager -- and the whole matter never comes up again.
Still more annoying is Mansbach's penchant for mysticism. Billy shares some of his experiences with his son by way of a 16-page drug trip that's as excruciating as it sounds, a yackety graffiti writer's way to Dullsville. There's also a 14-story apartment building where you can skip a day ahead by climbing every flight of stairs, and an actual ''demon'' deep in an underground lair that seems to possess Bracken during the night of the shooting, and may be about to take over Gotham -- but which is barely mentioned again and never seen.
Sorry, but it's a well-known rule of drama that if you put an all-powerful demonic presence on the stage it has to, well, go all demonic on us at some point. This is not magical realism but magic, Gabriel Garcםa Mבrquez by way of Hogwarts.
Even as metaphor this all feels terribly tired -- mostly because its creator's heart doesn't seem to be in it. What rage is he really talking about here, and to whom is it directed? Evil Rudy was shrunk back to human size years ago, with his pathetic foray into national politics. Dondi/Mansbach can't even find it in himself to condemn gentrification much; as he explains, reasonably enough, bumping into cheese lovers on the street ''beats running into rock fiends any day of the week.'' He claims to hate his old school mainly because they expelled him for running a major pot-dealing operation out of his locker. The bastards. He resents his barely seen, entirely sympathetic ex-girlfriend -- mainly, it seems, because her yuppie parents prefer wine to pot.
This is more Cheech and Chong than Che. Dondi tells us that ''being underground touched some vigorous, neglected part of me that had never stopped wanting to have adventures and explore new lands -- the part graffiti channeled when my parents were my age, and nothing channels today, to my generation's great misfortune.'' But this sounds more like Mansbach's complaint than his narrator's: Kids today!
At his best, Dondi emits a whiff of Holden Caulfield, channeled through a hip-hop sensibility. His social criticism can be gleefully clever when it comes to Brooklyn: ''A Connecticut Muffin shop opened on Myrtle a couple of years ago. That's what white people are doing in Fort Greene today: come for the baked goods, stay for the multimillion-dollar brownstones.'' But it misses the enormous bull's-eye of the Upper West Side, where a barbershop at 95th and West End is described as ''musky with propriety; you walked in and suddenly understood that there were correct ways to do things, manly things like applying after-shave or buying cuff links.'' This is a bizarre characterization of the old, eccentric, tattered Upper West Side, one so false it aches. There is, as well, a nasty, unwarranted little aside about Doc Gooden, and an offensive description of a sob emerging from a character's mouth ''like the first dude to leap from the North Tower.''
Where Caulfield's social critiques defined him, Dondi's only distance us. They make us all too aware of Mansbach's refusal to own his narrative, to keep us immersed in the defiant, anarchic passion of the graffiti writers, painting their names in letters six feet high in the nighttime yards of a crumbling city. Mansbach has an impressive command of graffiti history and lingo, and dialogue in general, but he smothers his story with all his magic staircases, and his magic weed, and his ambiguities.
We paint from life, not because we are so small but because God is so great. I remember George R. R. Martin chortling on TV something to the effect that his ''Game of Thrones'' books were better than history, because they were history plus fantasy. Yet I suspect there were more wonders in any one day of medieval history than are dreamed of in all of Martin's fantasies. The same could be said for New York back in the day -- or now.
Mansbach can write with real talent, maybe crazy talent. He ought to trust himself and put it up there for all of us to see.

THE INSURGENTSDavid Petraeus and the Plot to Change the American Way of War
By Fred KaplanIllustrated. 418 pp. Simon & Schuster. $28.
The American occupation of Iraq in its early years was a swamp of incompetence and self-delusion. The tales of hubris and reality-denial have already passed into folklore. Recent college graduates were tasked with rigging up a Western-style government. Some renegade military units blasted away at what they called ''anti-Iraq Forces,'' spurring an inchoate insurgency. Early on, Washington hailed the mess a glorious ''mission accomplished.'' Meanwhile, a ''forgotten war'' simmered to the east in Afghanistan. By the low standards of the time, common sense passed for great wisdom. Any American military officer willing to criticize his own tactics and question the viability of the mission brought a welcome breath of fresh air. 
Most alarming was the atmosphere of intellectual dishonesty that swirled through the highest levels of America's war on terror. The Pentagon banned American officers from using the word ''insurgency'' to describe the nationalist Iraqis who were killing them. The White House decided that if it refused to plan for an occupation, somehow the United States would slide off the hook for running Iraq. Ideas mattered, and many of the most egregious foul-ups of the era stemmed from abstract theories mindlessly applied to the real world.
There is no one better equipped to tell the story of those ideas -- and their often hair-raising consequences -- than Fred Kaplan, a rare combination of defense intellectual and pugnacious reporter. Kaplan writes Slate's War Stories column, a must-read in security circles. He brings genuine expertise to his fine storytelling, with a doctorate from M.I.T., a government career in defense policy in the 1970s and three decades as a journalist. Kaplan knows the military world inside and out; better still, he has historical perspective. With ''The Insurgents: David Petraeus and the Plot to Change the American Way of War,'' he has written an authoritative, gripping and somewhat terrifying account of how the American military approached two major wars in the combustible Islamic world. He tells how it was grudgingly forced to adapt; how it then overreached; and how it now appears determined to discard as much as possible of what it learned and revert to its old ways.
''The Insurgents'' proceeds like a whodunit starring a fringe community of officers who resisted the military's post-Vietnam embrace of mediocrity. It's breathtaking to realize just how hidebound and doctrinaire the Pentagon had become in the decades before 9/11. Though the cold war had ended, most top generals still believed the military should be training to block Soviet tanks at the Fulda Gap. Even while American ''advisers'' fought in minor shooting wars all over the globe, the brass officially denied these were genuine combat missions, calling them first ''low intensity conflicts'' and then, even more laughably and misleadingly, ''operations other than war.'' Kaplan explains how officers bent on preserving their careers and avoiding ''another Vietnam'' happily parroted nonsense to climb the ladder. Insurgencies and occupations were not a Pentagon priority; anyone who prepared for them was committing career hara-kiri.
All along, however, a small fraternity of independent thinkers nurtured a running critique of the way America conceived of, and actually fought, war. Though few in number, they were sprinkled throughout the Pentagon bureaucracy, the military ranks and the world of research institutions. This network grew into a powerful cabal, and Kaplan traces their work in meetings, military journals, commands and conflict zones over four decades. Their poster boy was David H. Petraeus, who distinguished himself by ambition, self-promotion and intellect. Eventually he almost single-handedly elevated counterinsurgency doctrine (known by its military acronym COIN) into a sort of gospel. For a brief period, COIN held sway in Washington.
Today, it's easy to condemn its faddish and facile elements, accentuated by its smug advocates (''An Insurgent Within the COIN Revolution,'' one of them titled a PowerPoint presentation).But Kaplan reminds us just how bad things had gotten in military circles by the time the United States invaded Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld simply fired or ignored officers and advisers who pointed out facts that didn't fit his conclusions. Men like Petraeus were dismissed as bookish nerds. Officers who criticized the orthodoxy, like Andrew Krepinevich Jr., were hounded out of the service, or, like H. R. McMaster, watched their careers stall. They are the heroes of Kaplan's book, although ultimately he gives them mixed reviews. They fell in thrall to their own gumption, he says, and as they rose to power they became complacent -- especially Petraeus. ''In part from overconfidence, in part from inertia,'' he started to see his counterinsurgency doctrine ''as a set of universal principles,'' Kaplan writes.
Still, how the COIN insurgents took over United States security policy makes for thrilling reading. These officers were assiduous climbers, and it is riveting to watch them swing from the battlefield, where they practiced neat COIN tricks like bribing militias and walling off neighborhoods by sect, to the Pentagon, where they engaged in conference-room jujitsu and water-cooler back-stabbing. For students of war, there's lots to learn about why the occupation of Iraq went badly and then better, and why America's designs to remake Afghanistan were never realistic. For everyone, there's a fascinating history of how true belief and dogged commitment can infect a resistant bureaucracy and grudgingly extract change.
The savvy Petraeus invited journalists everywhere, spawning the best kind of free publicity: profile after profile that portrayed him in heroic terms as a scholar-soldier always receptive to hard truths and willing to engage in self-criticism. He knew how to manage up, cultivating powerful Pentagon patrons and winning President Bush's favor with a misleading op-ed in The Washington Postjust before the 2004 election that touted what he claimed were a series of achievements in Iraq. He invited outside experts who agreed with him to advise him. When they thought he was acting on their ideas, they became passionate advocates. He ghostwrote articles, and then quoted them under his own byline. Kaplan relates how Petraeus, assigned in 2005 to run Fort Leavenworth, including its doctrine division, radically rewrote antiquated training manuals. A panicked staff member told him he was violating Army regulations that limited his changes to 10 percent; Petraeus demanded to see the rule, which, it turned out, didn't exist. It was a military myth. The anecdote exemplifies both the military's aversion to change and Petraeus's style of forcing it.
By the time he was appointed the top commander in Iraq in 2007, Petraeus had learned from his earlier mistakes as the head of the mission to train Iraq's security forces. Mosul, the city that he had successfully pacified for a year at the beginning of the war, had fallen apart; his improvised tactics had done some good, but couldn't survive transition to a new commander. Petraeus had churned out hundreds of thousands of hastily trained but well-armed police officers and soldiers, following orders to stand up indigenous forces of any quality so that America could stand aside. Once the Iraqi civil war heated up, these sloppily mustered forces deserted, defected or joined death squads. But now that he was in charge, he adopted as his strategy the Army field manual he had just written, and surrounded himself with old friends and mentees.
Petraeus and his merry band changed tactics, mobilizing a counterinsurgency network to pursue extremists with force, but spending most of their resources protecting Iraqi civilians from carnage. Petraeus got extra troops. And he benefited from significant developments completely beyond his control: Sunni tribes broke with Al Qaeda in Iraq, while the most formidable Shiite militia, the Mahdi Army, declared a unilateral cease-fire so its leader could purge rogue units.
President Bush had promoted the COINdinistas because they were flexible, pragmatic problem solvers and because he had a nagging problem on his hands: how to get out of Iraq without looking defeated. Counterinsurgency was just one part of the fortuitous mix that yielded a just-good-enough resolution for Iraq. Petraeus and the officers and experts had been right about how to fight in Iraq and reached plum positions in the Pentagon. But they overestimated themselves. They fancied they were inventing a new way of war and casting out the demons of a moribund Pentagon. In fact, they were doing something far less grandiose.
After President Obama took office, he adopted counterinsurgency strategy for Afghanistan, and made Petraeus the commander in that war. Yet by then, as Kaplan persuasively argues, counterinsurgency doctrine had calcified into dogma. COIN was just one tool in a great power's kit, not a one-size-fits-all solution, and in Afghanistan it made no sense at all. A counterinsurgency requires a long commitment, 10 years or more, and great numbers of troops, but the United States intended to pull out after a quick, small surge. Moreover, the Afghan government shared almost none of America's goals, making the war's mission untenable.
Kaplan damningly portrays a group of military officers and outside experts who cynically recommended a troop surge and a switch to counterinsurgency tactics in Afghanistan even though, he claims, they were skeptical that any strategy could actually stabilize the country. A formulaic Petraeus rambled on about his glory days in Iraq, even during meetings with the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, drawing warnings from his no-longer-fawning subordinates. He left with an aura of failure, and Obama, having been boxed in by his generals to escalate in Afghanistan, ultimately outmaneuvered them, calling their bluff and ordering a drawdown. The lesson of the COINdinistas' subversive struggle in the bureaucracy and their brief heyday was that you can't want victory more than the foreign government you're trying to prop up.
Kaplan's narrative ends before the news of Petraeus's embarrassing and career-halting extramarital affair, but the denouement of ''The Insurgents'' is sadder and certainly far more consequential.
The COIN brigade forced the Army to adapt, to become what one officer called ''a learning organization,'' but the Pentagon failed to grasp the most important lesson of the decade: that the military does best when it can learn new types of missions quickly, whether delivering aid after a tsunami, stabilizing a failed state or running covert missions against international terrorist rings. Instead, it exchanged an old dogma for a new one. Once persuaded that the military could do counterinsurgency, few in Washington stopped to think about when it should do it. ''Petraeus had stressed the importance of getting 'the big ideas' right, but the ideas in COIN theory weren't as big as he seemed to believe,'' Kaplan writes.
Obama has ordered the Pentagon to preserve the lessons of counterinsurgency and stability operations in case they're needed in the future, but Kaplan reports that the president has also ordered that minimal manpower or matיriel go toward preparing for resource-draining exercises in counterinsurgency and nation-building. The counterinsurgency cult was more than a fad, Kaplan establishes. But it was much less than a revolution.

Is there a link between violence in the media and in real life?
To the Editor:
The National Rifle Association's cynical exploitation of concerns about media violence to obfuscate the need for gun control trivializes a very real public health issue. Recent articles in The Times (''The Real World Forces Its Way Into the Gamers' Universe,'' Dec. 26; ''Real and Virtual Firearms Nurture a Marketing Link,'' Dec. 25) and elsewhere dismiss links between violent media and real-life violence, but the truth is far more complex.
Research repeatedly demonstrates that, for children, exposure to violent video games, movies and television programs is a risk factor for becoming desensitized to violence, lack of sympathy for victims and aggressive behavior. Proponents for allowing purveyors of violent media unfettered access to children dismiss the research because it is correlational and not causal.
But public health policy is often based on correlation between behavior and harm, and the correlation between media violence and aggression is almost as strong as the link between smoking cigarettes and lung cancer -- and stronger than other acknowledged public health threats such as the links between not using a condom and sexually transmitted H.I.V., and early exposure to lead and lower I.Q. scores. 
Regardless of the role violent media played or didn't play in the tragic Newtown shootings, children are harmed by frequent exposure to movies, video games, music and TV programs that glorify violence. We shouldn't let the National Rifle Association's smoke and mirrors, or the urgent need for gun control and effective, readily available mental health services, distract from the problem of media violence.
We need to stop allowing children to be targets for marketing violent media, and to help parents understand its potential dangers and set limits on its consumption.
SUSAN LINN Boston, Jan. 21, 2013
The writer is director of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood and author of ''Consuming Kids: The Hostile Takeover of Childhood.''
Readers React
As one of the leading researchers on media violence, I am concerned that research data be correctly represented. There is a large pool of data on media violence and aggression, but the findings have been inconsistent and the studies tend to be deeply flawed.
Further, as media violence has become more prevalent, societal violence, including youth violence, has declined to 40-year lows. Societies that share or exceed our media culture in violence, ranging from Canada to the Netherlands to Japan, have far lower violence rates even if you factor out gun violence (because of gun control laws).
Our society has a tendency toward ''confirmation bias,'' noting media effects when perpetrators are young males and ignoring media effects when perpetrators don't fit the stereotype. Together the evidence paints a picture pointing away from, not toward, media violence as a contributor to societal violence.
We know that after societal tragedies, it is common to blame media in a cycle of moral panic. We know that advocacy groups, though well intentioned, are often a part of those moral panics. So too, unfortunately, are some scholars.
But the evidence does not suggest that media violence contributes to a public health crisis -- far from it. This is not only my conclusion, but the conclusion of recent independent reviews by the United States Supreme Court and government reviews by Australia and Sweden. I encourage readers to seek out the evidence themselves, read studies on both sides and make up their own minds.
CHRISTOPHER J. FERGUSON Laredo, Tex., Jan. 23, 2013
The writer is an associate professor of psychology and communication at Texas A&M International University.
Ms. Linn is right to call out the National Rifle Association's disingenuous concern about media violence. The N.R.A. knows that there is a symbiotic relationship between media makers and gun manufacturers.
The Times reported last May that using brand-name guns in movies drives sales. It began in 1971 when ''Dirty Harry'' made the .44 Magnum a household word -- and made Smith & Wesson oodles of cash. The gun manufacturers make money twice: first when they license their weapon to appear in a video game or a movie, and again when the depiction drives sales.
Our devotion to the First Amendment makes any attempt to contain media violence very tricky. But this isn't really about free speech; it's about money. Movie and video-game producers create violent media -- boosting the sale of real guns -- because it makes them boatloads of money, in the United States and in foreign markets because violence doesn't require nuanced translation.
That payday is hard to resist. But we can, and we should. Public health advocates have been pressuring movie producers to limit the portrayals of smoking to movies with R ratings because robust research has found that movies are the leading cause of smoking initiation among young people. As they say, smoking in movies kills in real life.
We should insist that movie and video-game producers do the same thing: protect children by keeping violence out of children's media.
LORI DORFMAN Director, Berkeley Media Studies Group Berkeley, Calif., Jan. 23, 2013
As I read Ms. Linn's letter, I was struck by how little she backed up her argument with concrete examples. She seems sure that violent media are being marketed to children, but what media exactly? When and how? I see a lot of media with violent elements, but it's all marketed to adults, and teenagers where age-appropriate. If these are getting into the hands of young children, then that is a failure of parenting.
There is nothing intrinsically bad about violent media or any other form of media; they all have a time, a place and an appropriate audience. I have enjoyed many forms of media that include violence and subjects inappropriate for the very young.
I find gratuitous gore for its own sake in poor taste, but I would never consider restricting it legally. I simply vote with my dollars to promote what I consider better. We already have tools to prevent children from getting at things they shouldn't: rating systems, TV channels for children, technological filters. The missing link in the chain is parents.
I do sympathize with the challenges that parents face in our interconnected world, but looking to restrict the media landscape is not the answer.
NATHAN SKRESLET Richmond, Va., Jan. 23, 2013
Ms. Linn is absolutely right that parents should be the ones setting limits on what their children see, hear and play. Unfortunately, however, the same arguments she deploys in the rest of her letter present the traditional prelude to calls for actual government censorship.
Even if the scientific evidence on the issue were settled in the way she claims, which it is not, government restrictions on speech to limit what children see, hear or play will necessarily restrict far more speech than is necessary to address the perceived problem.
Censorship, especially in the name of protecting children, is never surgical. It will always limit the legitimate free speech rights of adults and, in this case, children. Consequently, it must be resisted.
GABE ROTTMAN Legislative Counsel/Policy Adviser American Civil Liberties Union Washington, Jan. 24, 2013
Ms. Linn's impassioned argument against media violence -- and against the National Rifle Association -- is surely well intentioned, but several underlying assumptions weaken her case.
Ms. Linn does not differentiate between forms of representational violence. In the same way that an actual gunshot to the face is significantly different from a punch in the nose, media portrayals of violence are not homogeneous, nor are their influences alike.
She also states that children are the ''targets for marketing violent media.'' While this is undoubtedly true to some extent, her assertion does not account for the fact that children are more likely to be curious eavesdroppers, looking in on the representations of violence that are oriented toward older and arguably more mature audiences. Despite being relatively toothless, ratings systems across different media products are evidence of industry awareness that not all content is child-friendly.
Finally, despite their tender age, children regularly demonstrate sophisticated interpretive skills pertaining to media, violence, and social attitudes and behaviors. Determining whether or not they are desensitized to violence is important work, but the majority of children who are exposed to media violence do not act out or mimic what they see. Let's try to learn a bit more from and about them before imposing restrictive policies.
MURRAY FORMAN Roxbury, Mass., Jan. 23, 2013
The writer is an associate professor of media and screen studies at Northeastern University.
Violent art, whether in audio, video or print, is simply an expression of the existing society. In other words, blaming the art is like blaming the mirror.
WILLIAM OLIVEIRA Northborough, Mass., Jan. 23, 2013
Ms. Linn's call to stop the marketing of violent media to children doesn't go far enough.
There can be no argument that frequent exposure to movies and video games that glorify violence harms children. Researchers at the University of Indiana Medical School found that such exposure changes the brains of heavy users, making them less able to understand the effects of actual violence. And we know that the military has used computer simulations for many years to desensitize soldiers and turn them into effective killers.
Efforts to protect children from violent media have been thwarted by the courts, citing the First Amendment. We should take seriously the advice of John Howard, former prime minister of Australia, who described in a Jan. 17 Op-Ed column how his country effectively responded to a horrific mass murder. ''Australia,'' he wrote, ''correctly in my view, does not have a Bill of Rights, so our legislatures have more say than America's over many issues of individual rights, and our courts have less control.''
We needn't scrap our Bill of Rights. But we must consider how to stop the courts from giving constitutional protection to the marketers of extreme and realistic violent images that would have sickened the authors of the First Amendment.
EDWARD MILLER Wellfleet, Mass., Jan. 24, 2013
The writer is a former editor of the Harvard Education Letter and a founding partner of the U.S. Alliance for Childhood.
While I am no fan of gun control, I am inclined to support Ms. Linn's premise that the deluge of virtual violence to which our children are constantly exposed cannot be good for them. As a child in the 1950s I was exposed to on-screen violence, in westerns and films about World War II, but they always seemed to carry a moral message of consequences. We had our toy six-shooters and role-playing games, but there were always rules and consequences.
There is no question that virtual training using digital simulators works well for the military and others. Digital simulators are really just very expensive video games. As in the computer games, if one crashes, the simulation is just reset and the student flies on, or, at worst, restarts the flight. Why would we expect the violent computer games to be any less effective at training the minds of our most impressionable to engage in violence while ignoring all personal and social consequences?
While children with a broad spectrum of activities and good adult role models and guidance may handle these games without visible damage, it is not clear that those lacking guidance or suitable role models fare as well.
TOM BALLOU Jr. Corpus Christi, Tex., Jan. 23, 2013
The writer is a retired Navy captain.
Ms. Linn argues that we must acknowledge the correlation between exposure to media violence and violent behavior. At Common Sense Media, we fully agree, and think that industry leaders must also acknowledge that violent movies and video games are being marketed to children from a very young age, and take steps to advertise more responsibly.
The new normal in this country plays out every weekend: Parents take their children to a movie theater, or gather to watch a football game, and are almost immediately bombarded with trailers or commercials for films and video games rated for mature audiences. At Common Sense, we talk to parents every day who face this challenge.
In a recent poll we commissioned with the Center for American Progress, 77 percent of parents believed that media violence, such as content in TV, movies, and video games, contributes to America's culture of violence.
The entertainment industry should behave responsibly when it comes to marketing violent movies and video games. That's why we've asked the leaders of the major networks, the National Football League and the National Basketball Association to exercise restraint and responsibility in considering the advertisements they feature in their broadcasts. We also believe that the Motion Picture Association of America has a responsibility to ensure that movie trailers shown before films are of an equal or lesser rating than the films they precede.
We don't want to see media used as a scapegoat while ignoring the need for real action on access to guns and mental health. The solution to the problem of violence in our world is not an issue of either/or. The only way to ensure that our children grow up in a world that's safe and filled with opportunity is to look at all the factors involved in our culture of violence. And in that mix, the marketing of violent content cannot be ignored.
JAMES P. STEYER San Francisco, Jan. 24, 2013
The writer is chief executive and founder of Common Sense Media, a nonprofit organization dedicated to improving the media and technology lives of children and families.
Ms. Linn is right. Children are constantly targeted by predatory companies that seek to exploit their innocence, as they're not old enough to wisely respond to what they're being sold. Marketing to children is unethical, and especially so with the marketing of violent media. Children deserve protection from the bully culture that can poison their minds and spirit.
RAFFI CAVOUKIAN Salt Spring Island, British Columbia, Jan. 23, 2013
The writer is the singer and founder of the Center for Child Honoring.
The Writer Responds
There's no question that violent media are heavily marketed to children. I direct Mr. Skreslet to several Federal Trade Commission investigations detailing how extensively kids are targeted -- including through media-linked toy and food promotions and advertising on children's television channels.
The rating systems he describes as adequate protection provide confusing and misleading information to parents. Research shows that movies that once would have been rated R for violence are now rated PG-13.
As for Mr. Ferguson's critique: After reviewing over 1,000 studies, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Psychological Association and other major public health organizations found that exposure to media violence is a risk factor for aggression, lack of sympathy for victims and desensitization to violence. The evidence continues to mount, including a meta-analysis of research on video-game violence by researchers from the United States and Japan that showed similar findings across cultures.
Identifying children's exposure to media violence as a public health problem and one of many factors contributing to societal violence doesn't constitute a ''moral panic.'' It's a common-sense response to powerful industries profiting from teaching kids that violence is a normal, even desirable, response to conflict.
As Mr. Rottman suggests, it's crucial that media companies be free from government censorship and able to create any content they please. But they shouldn't have the right to bypass parents and advertise violent media directly to children.

Macdougal Street Homesick Blues

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CIEPLY

LENGTH: 1014 words

SANTA MONICA, Calif. -- What if a folk singer got beat up outside a Greenwich Village nightclub in 1961?
Six, seven, or, maybe, eight years ago, as Joel Coen remembers it, that seemingly idle question about an unlucky singer in a hypothetical encounter at what used to be a real club called Gerde's Folk City started bothering Mr. Coen, who writes and directs off-center movies with his brother, Ethan.
Next week some music industry insiders and perhaps a few potential buyers will finally see, and hear, the resulting film at a private, pre-Grammys screening in Los Angeles.
It is called ''Inside Llewyn Davis.'' And it promises to be quintessential Coen brothers fare -- but different. 
For starters, Joel Coen explained, speaking recently over a bowl of oatmeal at the Fairmont Miramar Hotel here, ''Inside Llewyn Davis'' has a certain kinship with ''Les Misיrables.''
In it almost all the principal actors -- Oscar Isaac, Carey Mulligan, Justin Timberlake -- sing. ''There are lots of duets and trios,'' Mr. Coen said.
While not quite a musical, he added, ''Inside Llewyn Davis'' is built around full-length performances of folk songs that were heard in the grubby cafes of the Village in a year when Bob Dylan, who kind of, sort of shows up in the movie, had just appeared on the scene.
As for plot, Mr. Coen said, there isn't quite as much as is usual for the brothers, who in the past have written and directed elaborate crime stories like ''Fargo'' and ''No Country for Old Men.'' This time they present the travails, over maybe two weeks, of a struggling folk singer, Llewyn Davis, who is portrayed by Mr. Isaac.
For the record Llewyn Davis doesn't really resemble, or sound like, Dave Van Ronk, whose posthumous 2005 memoir, ''The Mayor of Macdougal Street,'' written with Elijah Wald, served as source material for the film.
''The character is not at all Dave, but the music is,'' said Mr. Wald, who spoke by telephone last week after having been given an early look at the film with Van Ronk's widow, Andrea Vuocolo Van Ronk.
He said he did not know for years that the Coens were behind an option for film rights to the book, which he based on Van Ronk's reminiscences, compiling them after his death in 2002. (Mr. Wald had spent years listening to Van Ronk's stories and got some pages from him before he died but otherwise did the writing.)
Mr. Wald said he ''thoroughly enjoyed'' the movie.
But he cautioned that the world of ''Inside Llewyn Davis,'' having been devised by the Coens, is ''less innocent'' than one inhabited by Van Ronk, Mr. Dylan, Paul Clayton, the Rev. Reverend Gary Davis, Joni Mitchell, Tom Paxton and the myriad other singers who are invoked in the film. Its story bounces through actual places like Gerde's, the Gaslight Cafי and the Gate of Horn in Chicago without explicitly portraying real artists or folk music powers like the impresario Albert Grossman.
If the film has had a slight air of mystery in recent months, that is partly because the Coens, working with the producer Scott Rudin, their collaborator on both ''True Grit'' and ''No Country for Old Men,'' made the film with backing from the French company Studio Canal but with no predetermined American distributor.
After shooting in New York City and elsewhere last year, Mr. Coen said, the brothers finished the movie at their own pace. They could have rushed it into the Oscar season but didn't. Instead a public debut at the Cannes film festival in May is possible, he said. And by then, assuming that buyers like it as much as Mr. Wald did,''Inside Llewyn Davis'' may have an American distributor, an army of publicists and a release date.
Working with the musician Marcus Mumford, Mr. Coen said, T Bone Burnett produced the music for ''Inside Llewyn Davis.'' Mr. Mumford, he added, sings in the movie. Mr. Burnett had earlier provided the old-time music for ''O Brother, Where Art Thou?,'' a Coen brothers caper that was based loosely on ''The Odyssey'' and was released in 2000 after a Cannes debut. ''This hillbilly music's going to be big,'' Mr. Burnett told the brothers at the time.
They were skeptical. But the soundtrack was a hit and has sold roughly eight million copies in the United States.
For ''Inside Llewyn Davis'' Mr. Burnett has helped to re-create the brief flowering of a folk scene that in the early '60s made Washington Square and its environs an unlikely crossroads for musical influences from Appalachia, the Deep South, the Far West, New England -- almost anywhere but New York's neighborhoods, from which some of its heartiest practitioners, and Llewyn Davis, arrived.
It was that cultural disconnect, Mr. Coen said, that lured him and his brother -- long fans of folk music -- to look for the movie in all of it. Van Ronk, the raspy balladeer of ''Cocaine Blues,'' which is heard briefly in the film, and ''Both Sides Now,'' which is not heard, was born in Brooklyn. Similarly, the itinerant singer Ramblin' Jack Elliott, Mr. Coen said, was actually Elliot Adnopoz, from Brooklyn as well.
Over all the music, including the traditional ballad ''Dink's Song,'' is drawn from the songbook of the early 1960s. But some slight anachronisms creep in, Mr. Coen said.
In life the poseurs and musical poets made things lively for a few short years, before electric instruments, changing tastes and an exploding counterculture left the folkies behind.
By the mid-1970s, Mr. Wald noted, Van Ronk, who was a kind of godfather to the scene but never enjoyed the superstar status that fell to Mr. Dylan or Ms. Mitchell, was grumbling that he should have stayed in the merchant marine.
When we catch up with Llewyn Davis in 1961, Mr. Coen said, he appears to be suffering frustrations of his own. While Mr. Coen did not say how the Gerde's beating fits in his story, a Web link associated with invitations to the pre-Grammy's screening shows the singer-hero getting bounced onto a parked car and pounded in a dark alley.
''He's trying to get some traction in his career and in his life,'' Mr. Coen said.
''How good you are doesn't always matter,'' he added. ''That's what the movie is about.''

Confessions of a Liberal Gun Owner

BYLINE: By JUSTIN CRONIN. 
Justin Cronin is the author, most recently, of the novel ''The Twelve.''

BELLAIRE, Tex.
I AM a New England liberal, born and bred. I have lived most of my life in the Northeast -- Boston, New York and Philadelphia -- and my politics are devoutly Democratic. In three decades, I have voted for a Republican exactly once, holding my nose, in a mayoral election in which the Democratic candidate seemed mentally unbalanced.
I am also a Texas resident and a gun owner. I have half a dozen pistols in my safe, all semiautomatics, the largest capable of holding 20 rounds. I go to the range at least once a week, have applied for a concealed carry license and am planning to take a tactical training course in the spring. I'm currently shopping for a shotgun, either a Remington 870 Express Tactical or a Mossberg 500 Flex with a pistol grip and adjustable stock.
Except for shotguns (firing one feels like being punched by a prizefighter), I enjoy shooting. At the range where I practice, most of the staff knows me by sight if not by name. I'm the guy in the metrosexual eyeglasses and Ralph Lauren polo, and I ask a lot of questions: What's the best way to maintain my sight picture with both eyes open? How do I clear a stove-piped round? 
There is pleasure to be had in exercising one's rights, learning something new in midlife and mastering the operation of a complex tool, which is one thing a gun is. But I won't deny the seductive psychological power that firearms possess. I grew up playing shooting games, pretending to be Starsky or Hutch or one of the patrolmen on ''Adam-12,'' the two most boring TV cops in history.
A prevailing theory holds that boys are simultaneously aware of their own physical powerlessness and society's mandate that they serve as protectors of the innocent. Pretending to shoot a bad guy assuages this anxiety, which never goes away completely. This explanation makes sense to me. Another word for it is catharsis, and you could say that, as a novelist, I've made my living from it.
There are a lot of reasons that a gun feels right in my hand, but I also own firearms to protect my family. I hope I never have to use one for this purpose, and I doubt I ever will. But I am my family's last line of defense. I have chosen to meet this responsibility, in part, by being armed. It wasn't a choice I made lightly. I am aware that, statistically speaking, a gun in the home represents a far greater danger to its inhabitants than to an intruder. But not every choice we make is data-driven. A lot comes from the gut.
Apart from the ones in policemen's holsters, I don't think I saw a working firearm until the year after college, when a friend's girlfriend, after four cosmopolitans, decided to show off the .38 revolver she kept in her purse. (Half the party guests dived for cover, including me.)
It wasn't until my mid-40s that my education in guns began, in the course of writing a novel in which pistols, shotguns and rifles, but also heavy weaponry like the AR-15 and its military analogue, the M-16, were widely used. I suspected that much of the gunplay I'd witnessed in movies and television was completely wrong (it is) and hired an instructor for a daylong private lesson ''to shoot everything in the store.'' The gentleman who met me at the range was someone whom I would have called ''a gun nut.'' A former New Yorker, he had relocated to Texas because of its lax gun laws and claimed to keep a pistol within arm's reach even when he showered. He was perfect, in other words, for my purpose.
My relationship to firearms might have ended there, if not for a coincidence of weather. Everybody remembers Hurricane Katrina; fewer recall Hurricane Rita, an even more intense storm that headed straight for Houston less than a month later. My wife and I arranged to stay at a friend's house in Austin, packed up the kids and dog, and headed out of town -- or tried to. As many as 3.7 million people had the same idea, making Rita one of the largest evacuations in history, with predictable results.
By 2 in the morning, after six hours on the road, we had made it all of 50 miles. The scene was like a snapshot from the Apocalypse: crowds milling restlessly, gas stations and mini-marts picked clean and heaped with trash, families sleeping by the side of the road. The situation had the hopped-up feel of barely bottled chaos. After Katrina, nobody had any illusions that help was on its way. It also occurred to me that there were probably a lot of guns out there -- this was Texas, after all. Here I was with two tiny children, a couple of thousand dollars in cash, a late-model S.U.V. with half a tank of gas and not so much as a heavy book to throw. When my wife wouldn't let me get out of the car so the dog could do his business, that was it for me. We jumped the median, turned around, and were home in under an hour.
As it happened, Rita made a last-minute turn away from Houston. But what if it hadn't? I believe people are basically good, but not all of them and not all the time. Like most citizens of our modern, technological world, I am wholly reliant upon a fragile web of services to meet my most basic needs. What would happen if those services collapsed? Chaos, that's what.
IT didn't happen overnight, but before too long my Northeastern liberal sensibilities, while intact on other issues, had shifted on the question of gun ownership. For my first pistol I selected a little Walther .380. I shot it enough to decide it was junk, upgraded to a full-size Springfield 9-millimeter, liked it but wanted something with a thumb safety, found a nice Smith & Wesson subcompact that fit the bill, but along the way got a little bit of a gun-crush on the Beretta M-9 -- and so on.
Lots of people on both sides of the aisle own firearms, or don't, for reasons that supersede their broader political and cultural affiliations. Let me be clear: my personal armory notwithstanding, I think guns are woefully under-regulated. It's far too easy to buy a gun -- I once bought one in a parking lot -- and I loathe the National Rifle Association. Some of the Obama administration's proposals strike me as more symbolic than effective, with some 300 million firearms on the loose. But the White House's recommendations seem like a good starting point and nothing that would prevent me from protecting my family in a crisis. The AR-15 is a fascinating weapon, and, frankly, a gas to shoot. So is a tank, and I don't need to own a tank.
Alas, the days of א la carte politics like mine seem over, if they ever even existed. The bigger culprit is the far right and the lunatic pronouncements of those like Rush Limbaugh. But in the weeks since Newtown, I've watched my Facebook feed, which is dominated by my coastal friends, fill up with anti-gun dispatches that seemed divorced from reality. I agree it would be nice if the world had exactly zero guns in it. But I don't see that happening, and calling gun owners ''a bunch of inbred rednecks'' doesn't do much to advance rational discussion.
Thus, my secret life -- though I guess it's not such a secret anymore. My wife is afraid of my guns (though she also says she's glad I have them). My 16-year-old daughter is a different story. The week before her fall semester exams, we allowed her to skip school for a day, a tradition in our house. The rule is, she gets to do whatever she wants. This time, she asked to take a pistol lesson. She's an NPR listener like me, but she's also grown up in Texas, and the fact that one in five American women is a victim of sexual assault is not lost on her. In the windowless classroom off the range, the instructor ran her through the basics, demonstrating with a Glock 9-millimeter: how to hold it, load it, pull back the slide.
''You'll probably have trouble with that part,'' he said. ''A lot of the women do.''
''Oh really?'' my daughter replied, and with a cagey smile proceeded to rack her weapon with such authority you could have heard it in the parking lot.
A proud-papa moment? I confess it was.

3 Years After Inception, a DNA Technique Yields Little Success for the Police

BYLINE: By JOSEPH GOLDSTEIN and J. DAVID GOODMAN

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 13

LENGTH: 1294 words

The robber fled through a backyard in Queens, dropping a jacket and gloves and with them, genetic material.
Detectives failed to find a suspect in tests comparing the material against a DNA database of convicted criminals. But the search yielded a near match to a convict with an unusually similar DNA profile. The convict may not have been the robber, but perhaps one of his relatives was.
The process of turning crime-scene DNA into a family tree of possible leads has been quietly undertaken in more than two dozen cases in New York City since 2009, when a divided state committee voted to allow the release of so-called partial match DNA data to investigators.
Three years in, the street-level experience in New York has been decidedly mixed: Law enforcement officials said they knew of no cases solved in New York City because of a lead generated by a partial match. 
The reason, investigators suggest, may be because New York -- unlike states like California, Colorado and Virginia -- has not allowed authorities to use existing software that explicitly searches state databases for kinship connections in specific investigations. Instead, during routine searches for exact matches in the databases, detectives and prosecutors are notified each time a piece of evidence matches most but not all of a database profile, suggesting a possible relationship.
In the case of the Queens robbery in 2010, detectives could not request a family search be performed; they were merely informed that a DNA sample partially matched a profile in the database. Detectives chose to pursue the potential lead, developing a family tree from the DNA sample; that led them to secretly securing a genetic sample from the father of a convict. But after tests ruled him out, they concluded the robber in Queens had no blood connection to the family under scrutiny, said Phil T. Pulaski, the chief of detectives, at a public hearing.
It is not clear whether the more tailored search software used in other states would have ruled out the family in this case before any detective work was done. ''It is incredibly inefficient because you can't target a particular case,'' Melissa Mourges, the chief of forensic sciences at the Manhattan district attorney's office, said of the process in New York. ''Therefore a lot of work gets done upfront in cases that we would not ultimately pursue.''
Chief Pulaski explained that New York City detectives had used searches of the DNA database to pursue potential kinship leads in 25 cases, but had hit dead ends in four of them: the Queens robbery, a 1996 rape in a Manhattan hospital, a 2005 murder in south Queens and a 2007 Bronx murder. Chief Pulaski described those cases in detail to the DNA subcommittee of the State Commission on Forensic Science last year. (A fifth case was closed after the victim recanted, Chief Pulaski said.)
The four cases described by Chief Pulaski offer a unique glimpse at new genealogical procedures being honed by detectives. ''In this family tree, we have 17 family members,'' Chief Pulaski said, discussing the hospital rape case. ''We have ancestors, siblings, nephews,'' he continued. The police took DNA from two brothers and two nephews of the convict, he said, as well as from autopsy samples from two relatives.
But none of that matched the evidence from the rape case. ''We're at a point where we don't believe there is a biological relationship,'' Chief Pulaski said.
He did not publicly discuss the 20 cases in which detectives are actively looking at relatives and could still result in leads.
Before the policy change in 2009, medical examiners were permitted to share only the names of offenders whose DNA appeared to exactly match crime-scene DNA. When medical examiners saw a partial match -- suggestive of a familial relationship -- they kept it to themselves. The 2009 change allowed the medical examiner's office to notify investigators, inquiring whether they wanted to know the name.
''It's up to them to do the legwork and see if they can find relatives that might be appropriate to test,'' said Marie Samples, an assistant director of the New York City medical examiner's office.
Wary of setting off a civil liberties debate that has so far been mostly avoided, law enforcement officials in New York have been reluctant to call for using familial search software, content to experiment with the results from partial matches.
''It's not like we were jumping for joy that this was going to be the elixir,'' said Joseph L. Giacalone, a retired commander of the Bronx cold case squad. ''But you have a suspect where in the past you wouldn't have anybody.''
But in roughly two-thirds of the cases, New York detectives and prosecutors have declined to learn the names. Of more than 140 names generated from partial matches, Chief Pulaski said, the police declined in 93 cases.
Asked in what circumstances the police might forgo the information, Deputy Inspector Emanuel J. Katranakis told the subcommittee that in some of these instances there had already been ''a conviction and an individual is serving a sentence.''
Chief Pulaski added, however, that the police were ''very careful to use this and consider this as an exoneration tool, as well as an investigative tool to see who did it.''
Critics worry the authorities have too much discretion to use -- or ignore -- partial-match information, which routinely brings innocent family members under suspicion. ''It's a directive to the police to use your imagination,'' said Robert Perry of the New York Civil Liberties Union. In addition, the group argues, minority communities may disproportionately fall under suspicion because the underlying DNA database, based on convicted felons, contains a greater percentage of black and Hispanic offenders.
Chief Pulaski said the police usually declined information about partial matches because of skepticism that the evidence was relevant to a case. At crime scenes, the police often collect cigarettes or beer bottles for testing even though passers-by may have left them.
Chief Pulaski described a 2007 murder in a Bronx park in which the police had found a baseball cap some 60 feet away from bullet casings.
Testing of the cap showed similarities to the DNA of a convicted offender, prompting detectives to learn more about three of his male relatives -- his father and his two sons. Witness descriptions of the shooter, however, excluded the father as too old and the sons as too young, Chief Pulaski said, leading detectives to conclude the baseball cap had no connection to the killing.
Some here have looked to the expanding number of states where more highly targeted searches for family members have provided breaks in high-profile cold cases, notably the 2010 arrest of a suspect in the so-called Grim Sleeper case.
In that case, California law enforcement officials identified a Los Angeles serial killer, whose crimes stretched back to the 1980s, after a 2010 database search turned up a possible relation. Detectives gathered DNA from that man's father, which matched the old crime scenes; he was charged with the killings.
Such highly tailored software searches, so-called familial searches, are believed to detect family relationships better -- particularly those among siblings -- than partial-match results generated in New York.
''Being able to pursue partial match is important,'' said Mitch Morrissey, the district attorney in Denver and a leading advocate of familial database searching. ''It does work sometimes, but if you're going to be doing this type of work, you really need familial search software.''
But, he cautioned, the results are still just one step in solving a hard-to-close case. ''The science gets you to a viable lead, but then you have to do a conventional investigation,'' he said.

Morsi Declares Emergency Rule In 3 Egypt Cities

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK; Mayy El Sheikh contributed reporting from Port Said, and Kareem Fahim from Cairo.

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 1376 words

PORT SAID, Egypt -- President Mohamed Morsi declared a state of emergency and a curfew in three major cities on Sunday, as escalating violence in the streets threatened his government and Egypt's democracy.
By imposing a one-month state of emergency in Suez, Ismailia and here in Port Said, where the police have lost all control, Mr. Morsi's declaration chose to use one of the most despised weapons of former President Hosni Mubarak's autocracy. Under Mubarak-era laws left in effect by the country's new Constitution, a state of emergency suspends the ordinary judicial process and most civil rights. It gives the president and the police extraordinary powers.
Mr. Morsi, Egypt's first freely elected president and a leader of the political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood, took the step after four days of clashes in Cairo and in cities around the country between the police and protesters denouncing his government. Most of the protests were set off by the second anniversary of the popular revolt that ousted Mr. Mubarak, which fell on Friday. 
Here in Port Said, the trouble started over death sentences that a court imposed on 21 local soccer fans for their role in a deadly riot. But after 30 people died in clashes on Saturday -- most of them shot by the police -- the protesters turned their ire on Mr. Morsi as well the court. Police officers crouching on the roofs of their stations fired tear gas and live ammunition into attacking mobs, and hospital officials said that on Sunday at least seven more people died.
Tens of thousands of people marched through the streets of Port Said on Sunday demanding independence from the rest of Egypt. ''The people want the state of Port Said,'' they chanted in anger at Cairo.
The emergency declaration covers the three cities and their surrounding provinces, all on the economically vital Suez Canal. Mr. Morsi announced the emergency measures in a stern, finger-waving speech on state television on Sunday evening. He said he was acting ''to stop the blood bath'' and called the violence in the streets ''the counterrevolution itself.''
''There is no room for hesitation, so that everybody knows the institution of the state is capable of protecting the citizens,'' he said. ''If I see that the homeland and its children are in danger, I will be forced to do more than that. For the sake of Egypt, I will.''
Mr. Morsi's resort to the authoritarian measures of his predecessor appeared to reflect mounting doubts about the viability of Egypt's central government. After decades of corruption, cronyism and brutality under Mr. Mubarak, Egyptians have struggled to adjust to resolving their differences -- whether over matters of political ideology or crime and punishment -- through peaceful democratic channels.
''Why are we unable to sort out these disputes?'' asked Moattaz Abdel-Fattah, a political scientist and academic who was a member of the assembly that drafted Egypt's new Constitution. ''How many times are we going to return to the state of Egyptians killing Egyptians?'' He added: ''Hopefully, when you have a genuine democratic machine, people will start to adapt culturally. But we need to do something about our culture.''
Mr. Morsi's speech did nothing to stop the violence in the streets. In Cairo, fighting between protesters and the police and security forces escalated into the night along the banks of the Nile near Tahrir Square. On a stage set up in the square, liberal and leftist speakers demanded the repeal of the Islamist-backed Constitution, which won approval in a referendum last month.
Young men huddled in tents making incendiary devices, while others set tires on fire to block a main bridge across the Nile.
In Suez, a group calling itself the city's youth coalition said it would hold nightly protests against the curfew at the time it begins, 9 p.m. In Port Said, crowds began to gather just before the declaration was set to take effect, at midnight, for a new march in defiance.
''We will gather every night at 9 at Mariam's mosque,'' said Ahmed Mansour, a doctor. ''We will march all night long until morning.''
He added: ''Morsi is an employee who works for us. He must do what suits us, and this needs to be made clear.''
The death sentences handed down on Saturday to the 21 Port Said soccer fans stemmed from a brawl with fans of a visiting Cairo team last year that left 74 people dead. At a funeral on Sunday for at least a dozen civilians killed in clashes with the police on Saturday, angry Port Said residents called the sentences a capitulation to the threats of violence from hard-core soccer fans in Cairo if the Port Said defendants were acquitted. The mourners vowed to escalate their own violence in response.
''They wanted to please Cairo and the people there, so they decided this verdict at the expense of Port Said,'' said Ayman Ali El Sayed Awad, 32, a street vendor whose brother was killed on Saturday by a police bullet. ''And just like they avenged the Cairo people with blood and killed 30 of our people yesterday, we want the rights of our martyrs.''
A friend interrupted: ''They were celebrating yesterday -- celebrating our blood!''
Tens of thousands of mourners -- some wearing the long beards associated with Islamists and others in affluent dress -- carried the coffins toward the cemetery on a road along the shore of the Mediterranean Sea. Then the funeral procession passed the Grand Sky Resort, which belongs to the police.
It was unclear how the clashes began, but the police were soon firing heavy volleys of tear gas into the funeral march. The gas attacks caused the pallbearers to drop coffins, many witnesses said, and the bodies spilled into the streets, a serious indignity here.
Soon, thousands of mourners who had already passed the police club returned to attack it. Gunfire rang out, some from automatic weapons. Officers with rifles and tear-gas cannons could be seen on the roof of the resort, crouching and scurrying and sometimes firing their weapons.
Outside, protesters threw rocks, at least one incendiary bomb, and some of the still-smoking canisters of tear gas back at the police. One thrown canister set fire to a palm tree in a nearby cemetery, and another fire of unknown origin broke out inside the police club. By the end of the night, at least three protesters were seen carrying handguns and one an automatic rifle.
Similar battles broke out around police stations all over Port Said, with heavily armed officers defending them from the roofs. The first protester wounded by live ammunition was carried into the central hospital at 3:30 p.m., and by 4 p.m. the odor of tear gas and the sound of gunfire had permeated several neighborhoods around police stations for hours. Outside the police club, officers armed with automatic riffles had moved from the roof to confront opponents on the pavement, and were firing gas straight into the crowd.
But despite the facts on the ground, a spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior said in a televised interview around the same time that the Port Said police were unarmed and that tear gas was used only briefly about three hours earlier. The spokesman, Gen. Osama Ismail, blamed the gunfire on ''infiltrating saboteurs'' and suggested that civilians may have fired the tear gas.
''Are there any police forces there to begin with?'' General Ismail said. ''This is only a small group pushing back against intense shooting.''
Mr. Morsi had already deployed army troops to secure vital facilities around the city, and they stood unmolested outside the prison and certain administrative buildings. But the soldiers made no effort to control the streets, and watched without intervening as besieged police officers battled civilian mobs.
In his speech on Sunday night, Mr. Morsi praised and thanked the police and the armed forces for their work battling the chaos. He also renewed his invitation to his political opponents to join him in a ''national dialogue,'' beginning with a meeting on Monday evening.
But Mr. Abdel-Fattah, the political scientist, was skeptical that such a dialogue could restore trust in the government.
''Morsi has, to a large extent, lost his credibility before the opposition -- too many false promises,'' he said. ''There is going to be chaos for some time.''

Stanley Karnow, Historian, Is Dead at 87

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

SECTION: Section D; Column 0; Obituary; Pg. 8

LENGTH: 1111 words

Stanley Karnow, a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian and journalist who produced acclaimed books and television documentaries about Vietnam and the Philippines in the throes of war and upheaval, died on Sunday at his home in Potomac, Md. He was 87.
The cause was congestive heart failure, said Mr. Karnow's son, Michael.
For more than three decades Mr. Karnow was a correspondent in Southeast Asia, working for Time, Life, The Saturday Evening Post, The Washington Post, NBC News, The New Republic, King Features Syndicate and the Public Broadcasting Service. But he was best known for his books and documentaries.
He was in Vietnam in 1959, when the first American advisers were killed, and lingered long after the guns fell silent, talking to fighters, villagers, refugees, North and South Vietnamese political and military leaders, the French and the Americans, researching a people and a war that had been little understood. 
The result was the 750-page book ''Vietnam: A History,'' published in 1983, and its companion, a 13-hour PBS documentary, ''Vietnam: A Television History.'' Unlike many books and films on Vietnam in the 1960s and '70s and the nightly newscasts that focused primarily on America's role and its consequences at home and abroad, Mr. Karnow addressed all sides of the conflict and traced Vietnam's culture and history.
''Vietnam: A History'' was widely praised and a best seller. The documentary, with Mr. Karnow as chief correspondent, was at the time the most successful ever produced by public television, viewed by an average of nearly 10 million people a night through 13 episodes. It won six Emmy Awards, as well as Peabody, Polk and duPont-Columbia awards.
Six years later, Mr. Karnow delivered his second comprehensive book and television examination of a Southeast Asian nation. The book, ''In Our Image: America's Empire in the Philippines'' (1989), was a panorama of centuries of Filipino life under Spanish and American colonial rule, followed by independence under sometimes corrupt American-backed leaders. It won the 1990 Pulitzer Prize for history.
Narrated by Mr. Karnow, the three-part PBS documentary ''The U.S. and the Philippines: In Our Image'' traced America's paternalistic colonial rule in the Philippines, the shared suffering of Filipinos and Americans under a cruel Japanese occupation in World War II, and Manila's postwar independence under regimes nominally democratic but repressive, corrupt or indifferent to the miseries of its people.
Mr. Karnow also wrote ''Mao and China: From Revolution to Revolution'' (1972) and was a co-author of or contributor to books based on his years in Asia, including ''Asian-Americans in Transition'' (1992), ''Passage to Vietnam'' (1994), ''Mekong'' (1995) and ''Historical Atlas of the Vietnam War'' (1995).
Early in his career he lived in Paris for a decade, and in 1997 he published a memoir, ''Paris in the Fifties.'' A nostalgic reporter's notebook of life among the cafe philosophers, bereted musicians and pseudo-revolutionary artistes, it danced with digressions about taxes, restaurants, the guillotine, Hemingway, Charles de Gaulle and the Devil's Island penal colony.
In its range, learning and appetite for fun, Bernard Kalb, the former CBS reporter and Mr. Karnow's friend since Vietnam, told The Associated Press in 2009, the memoir was vintage Karnow. ''Stanley has a great line about how being a journalist is like being an adolescent all your life,'' he said.
Stanley Karnow was born in Brooklyn on Feb. 4, 1925, the son of Harry and Henriette Koeppel Karnow. He grew up in a city with more than a dozen daily newspapers and decided early that he wanted to become a reporter. He served in the Army Air Forces in World War II. After graduating from Harvard with a bachelor's degree in 1947, he sailed for France, intending to spend the summer. He stayed for a decade.
Mr. Karnow married Claude Sarraute in 1948. They were divorced in 1955. In 1959, he married Annette Kline. They had two children, Michael and Catherine, who survive him, along with a stepson, Curtis Karnow, and two grandchildren. His second wife died in 2009.
He studied politics at the University of Paris in 1948-49, and from 1950 to 1957 was a Paris correspondent for Time magazine, covering Western Europe and North Africa. As Algeria's war of independence shook France with increasing violence, Mr. Karnow was posted to North Africa in 1958.
In 1959 Mr. Karnow moved to Southeast Asia, established a base in Hong Kong and traveled widely in a region rife with conflicts. He was not typical of the Western correspondents, most of whom worked for one publication, dropped into war zones or political hot spots, wrote a few articles and moved on. He often had more than one employer, including weekly newsmagazines and other publications without daily deadlines, and he was drawn to reporting in greater depth and longer, more analytical writing forms.
Mr. Karnow was an Asian correspondent for Time-Life from 1959 to 1962, The London Observer from 1961 to 1965, The Saturday Evening Post from 1963 to 1965 and The Washington Post from 1965 to 1971. He was a diplomatic correspondent for The Washington Post in 1971 and 1972, and a special correspondent for NBC and an associate editor of The New Republic from 1973 to 1975.
In his first book, ''Southeast Asia'' (1962), an illustrated Life World Library volume, he noted that Ngo Dinh Diem, South Vietnam's authoritarian anti-Communist president, was in danger of being overthrown. In November 1963, President Diem was slain in a military coup that the Kennedy administration had tacitly endorsed.
Besides reporting periodically from Vietnam, Mr. Karnow covered news events across the region, including President Richard M. Nixon's historic trip to China in 1972, for The Washington Post. Although he was one of 87 news representatives chosen by the White House to accompany Nixon to China, Mr. Karnow was also on the White House ''enemies list'' made public by the Senate Watergate committee in 1973.
As China emerged from decades of isolation, Mr. Karnow's book ''Mao and China'' examined the nation's history from the Communist revolution through the Cultural Revolution, and also looked at Chairman Mao's often conflicting roles in the period.
After the Vietnam War Mr. Karnow was a columnist for King Features from 1975 to 1988, wrote for the French newsweekly Le Point from 1976 to 1983 and for Newsweek International from 1977 to 1981, and was an editor with the International Writers Service from 1976 to 1986.
He was a Nieman Fellow at Harvard University in 1958 and was a recipient of many awards, including the Shorenstein Prize for reporting on Asia.

A Safety Officer Is Shot in Brooklyn

BYLINE: By J. DAVID GOODMAN and JULIE TURKEWITZ

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 15

LENGTH: 138 words

An off-duty school safety agent was shot in the chest while sitting in his car outside his family's house in Brooklyn on Sunday evening, the police said. 
The agent, who is 25, was taken to Kings County Hospital Center in stable condition, according to Paul J. Browne, the Police Department's chief spokesman.
Relatives and neighbors at the scene identified the wounded agent as Brian Green, who lived with his parents on East 51st Street between Clarkson Avenue and Lenox Road in East Flatbush.
A neighbor, Rodney James, 22, said he had ''heard three shots, then two seconds later, two extra shots.''
Eavean Bernard, Mr. Green's aunt, said he had just dropped her off at her home nearby. He then drove back to East 51st Street, where the shooting occurred shortly after 5:30 p.m.
Mr. Browne said the shooting remained under investigation.

The Politics Behind the Guns Debate

To the Editor:
As a Vietnam veteran, an owner of both a rifle and a pistol, and a not-so-successful sheep hunter, I am one of the millions of Americans with guns as part of our lives. I am also a father. Because I am all of the above I am profoundly thankful that President Obama has challenged us to live within both our rights and responsibilities to save the lives of innocent victims of gun violence.
The horror of Newtown has shocked us into the realization that we must change. The families and friends of the victims of Columbine, Virginia Tech, Tucson and Aurora might ask why did it take so long. I don't know the answer. And we will never know how many lives will be saved if we do act. All we know is the shame we must share if we don't act. 
As a former elected official, I have seen the power of people to create change despite the opposition and clout of well-connected and well-financed organizations and lobbyists. So I proudly join all of the veterans, gun owners and hunters who understand and value the rights and responsibilities that come with gun ownership and have the backbone to state their case.
Banning assault weapons, restricting ammunition magazines and requiring background checks on all sales are a start. It will not really change our lives as gun owners, but it may change the life of one innocent child by saving it.
TONY KNOWLES Anchorage, Jan. 19, 2013
The writer was governor of Alaska from 1994 to 2002.
To the Editor:
Re ''Democrats in Senate Confront Doubts at Home on Gun Laws'' (front page, Jan. 24):
Some Democrats, especially in rural states, fear repercussions at the voting booth if they support legislation limiting any level of gun control. Those proposed limits include restrictions on assault weapons and large ammunition clips and additional screening of prospective gun buyers.
Senators in states that manufacture weapons also fear negative economic consequences. They are even afraid to explain to their constituents that proposed legislation would not take away Second Amendment rights to own an arsenal of popular weapons.
Perhaps I am completely naןve about politics, but this article did not even mention the possibility that one of our elected representatives might vote his or her conscience on this issue. It seems clear that at least some of our representatives believe that our current lack of gun limitations is unconscionable, but evidently less important than re-election.
The National Rifle Association mocks common sense, ginning up false arguments to appease its base and stay in business. Do our representatives in Washington act any differently?
JOHN VASI Santa Barbara, Calif., Jan. 24, 2013
To the Editor:
Your article quotes Charlie Houck, a West Virginia banker, as saying, ''We give up our rights one piece at a time.'' Exactly right, sir.
Yesterday morning my wife received a phone call -- the local elementary school attended by my two little girls, ages 8 and 6, was locked down. My daughters spent their morning under their desks, terrified; I won't describe my own or my wife's state of mind.
Later in the day dozens of guns were removed from a house across the street from the school by local and federal law enforcement agents. Yes, Mr. Houck, our rights are being taken away, including the right to live, unafraid, in a country that values the lives of children more than it values firearms.

Intestinal Infection

SECTION: Section ; Column 0; Editorial Desk; LETTER; Pg. 

LENGTH: 202 words

To the Editor:
''When Pills Fail, This, er, Option Provides a Cure'' (front page, Jan. 17) provides welcome visibility to the underreported epidemic of Clostridium difficile, or C. difficile, which claimed my mother three years ago. 
Estimates from the Department of Health and Human Services indicate that yearly deaths from the disease exceed 28,000, or more than double the 14,000 cited in the article, and rivaling the number of Americans killed every year by guns and traffic accidents.
The Dutch study on the efficacy of fecal transplant treatment provides hope for thousands of people touched by the disease. The article, however, doesn't mention that a major barrier to C. difficile treatment of any kind is a missed diagnosis for its symptoms of diarrhea, cramps and fever.
Erroneous diagnosis for a disease in which consuming antibiotics is often the root of disease and not the cure also contributes to its severity.
For this disease in particular, greater clinical and public awareness can alleviate suffering and save lives.

The writer is executive director of the Peggy Lillis Memorial Foundation, an advocacy group devoted to preventing C. difficile infections.

'Fruitvale' Wins At Sundance

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

SECTION: Section C; Column 0; The Arts/Cultural Desk; CARPETBAGGER; Pg. 2

LENGTH: 525 words

LOS ANGELES -- "Fruitvale," a drama produced by Forest Whitaker and snapped up for distribution earlier this week by Harvey Weinstein, won the Sundance Film Festival's top prize on Saturday night.
"This will not be the last time you guys walk to a podium," said Tom Rothman, the former chairman of 20th Century Fox, as he presented the festival's grand jury prize for an American narrative film to "Fruitvale." The drama, which is based on a 2009 shooting in Oakland, Calif., had already taken home one of Sundance's coveted audience awards.
Mr. Weinstein is expected to back "Fruitvale" as a contender in next year's Oscar race. Ryan Coogler, a first-time filmmaker, directed and wrote the film, which stars Michael B. Jordan ("Parenthood") and features Octavia Spencer, an Oscar winner last year for "The Help." 
"Fruitvale" had little prefestival buzz, and the same was true of another big winner on Saturday. "Blood Brother," about a disenfranchised American who travels to India and stumbles across an orphanage for HIV-positive children, won the grand jury and audience awards in the United States documentary category.
Lake Bell won the festival's prestigious Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award for "In a World," a comedy set in the world of voice-over actors; she also directed the film and played its leading role.
The Sundance awards ceremony, a laid-back affair where attendees wear blue jeans and fleece and sit in folding chairs, was held in Park City, Utah, and streamed live online. Over 30 prizes -- chunks of glass that resemble broken ice -- were given out in categories that included acting and cinematography.
Joseph Gordon-Levitt, the director, writer and star of one of this year's buzziest festival entries, "Don Jon's Addiction," served as M.C. (Robert Redford, who founded the Sundance Institute in 1981, cast a 10-year-old Mr. Gordon-Levitt in "A River Runs Through It," the actor noted in his opening remarks.) Jurors included Mr. Rothman, the documentarian Davis Guggenheim ("An Inconvenient Truth") and the actor-director Ed Burns ("The Brothers McMullen.")
Foreign film jury prizes on Saturday went to "Jiseul," a drama set during the 1948 Jeju massacre in Korea that was directed by Muel O., and "A River Changes Course," Kalyanee Mam's documentary about rural villages in Cambodia.
They joined a smattering of foreign filmmakers who have already won accolades at this year's festival. Kentaro Hagiwara of Japan was given the Sundance/NHK International Filmmaker Award, a $10,000 prize based on past work and the script for a follow-up movie; Mr. Hagiwara previously directed a short film called "Super Star" and his next project is a coming-of-age romance called "Spectacled Tiger." The Sundance Institute and Mahindra Group, a Mumbai-based industrial conglomerate, on Tuesday recognized four emerging directors from overseas with $10,000 prizes and "year-round mentoring" from institute staff for their next feature. They are Sarthak Dasgupta of India; Jonas Carpignano of Italy; Aly Muritiba of Brazil; Vendela Vida of Britain and Eva Weber of Germany.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Nine 3-Pointers, 42 Points And a Layup to Win It

BYLINE: By NATE TAYLOR

SECTION: Section D; Column 0; Sports Desk; KNICKS 106, HAWKS 104; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 884 words

Carmelo Anthony did not let the final seconds on the clock run down. Anthony's decision was smart and it proved to be one of the small differences between the Knicks and the Atlanta Hawks on Sunday night. Anthony received the pass from Raymond Felton. He paused for a second to take a deep breath. Then he showed his biggest burst of energy toward the basket.
Anthony surprised the Hawks, and in particular Josh Smith, who was responsible for stopping him. With a quick first step to get by Smith, Anthony drove to his left for a sweeping layup with 12.5 seconds left. 
Smith also fouled Anthony, and as the capacity crowd at Madison Square Garden chanted ''M-V-P,'' Anthony converted the free throw for the 3-point play to give the Knicks a 106-104 victory.
''It was just the matter of not letting Josh Smith set his feet,'' Anthony said of the winning play. ''I just wanted to catch the ball and go to catch him off guard.''
Anthony was in a position to win the game after a couple of mistakes by Smith. It was Smith who turned the ball over twice in the final minute. He committed a backcourt violation when Anthony pressured him and then was called for a moving screen on Felton.
But just before time expired, Smith was given a chance for redemption -- and it came off a deflection from Anthony.
''Carmelo should have had that steal,'' said Iman Shumpert, who was on the court during the final play.
Smith hoisted up a wide-open 3-pointer, but the ball bounced high off the back of the rim.
''I just hate those shots,'' Shumpert said. ''He shot it so high that we had to wait so long. I'm just glad he missed it.''
Anthony agreed: ''That was one of the longest shots I've ever looked at.''
With Smith's miss, the night belonged to Anthony as he ignited the Knicks (27-15) from the second quarter on. He finished with a game-high 42 points, including a franchise-tying nine 3-pointers, as the Knicks went 16 of 27 (59 percent) from long range. Anthony shares the record with Toney Douglas, Latrell Sprewell and John Starks. Sprewell achieved the feat twice.
Anthony, though, did his work in three quarters, not even attempting a 3-pointer in the fourth quarter. He said he did not know he had tied the record until after the game.
''Someone told me why I didn't try to make my 10th one,'' he said.
Anthony struggled early, going 2 of 9 from the field to start the game, before making two straight 3-pointers. He then called for the ball as soon as the Knicks grabbed the next defensive rebound, even before they crossed midcourt. Anthony, one of the best shooters in the N.B.A., wanted to see just how hot he was.
When Felton gave the ball to Anthony -- on a backward dribble between his legs -- he did not put the ball on the court once. Also one of the quickest shooters in the N.B.A., Anthony rose up, and so did the entire Garden crowd. Anthony's 26-foot shot, from the MSG logo on the court, swished through the net, producing the loudest roar of the first half. Indeed, Anthony was hot.
''I looked at Raymond and he was telling me to run,'' Anthony said. ''Once he cut his man off and bounced it back, I pulled up and had no idea where I was at.''
The extra-long 3-pointer was Anthony's third consecutive basket from long range and it gave the Knicks a 52-47 lead. The only question after the shot was whether Anthony could keep up that pace in the second half.
He did. Anthony did not miss from behind the arc on five attempts in the third quarter. It was a welcome sight for Knicks fans after Anthony had struggled to shoot the ball from anywhere on the court the past week.
He went 31 of 85 in the previous three games, when the Knicks went 1-2.
''He needed a breakout,'' Coach Mike Woodson said. ''He's been scoring, but he just hasn't been shooting at a high rate. Tonight I couldn't rest him. He came up big with big shots.''
Against the Hawks, Anthony was left wide open at times, which was something he had not experienced when Felton, the Knicks' starting point guard, missed 12 games with a fractured right pinkie.
Felton scored 9 of his 12 points in the first quarter; then he focused on getting the ball to his teammates, finishing with 10 assists. The Knicks also got 18 points each from Amar'e Stoudemire and J. R. Smith.
Atlanta (25-19) was able to stay in the game because Jeff Teague exposed what appears to be the Knicks' biggest problem on defense: guarding a quick, young point guard. Teague scored a team-high 27 points and created scoring opportunities for others. He had a chance to give the Hawks the lead late in the fourth quarter, but he missed a driving layup.
On the next possession, Anthony made a fadeaway baseline jumper. And when the Knicks needed their most important basket, Anthony provided it.
REBOUNDS
Jason Kidd finished with two assists in five minutes and did not play in the second half Sunday. The Knicks said Kidd, who was having back pain in Thursday's game against Boston, needed rest and that he was not injured. Kidd was also limited against Philadelphia on Saturday, playing just 15 minutes and not recording a point or an assist, just the third time that has happened in his career. In December, he missed four games with back spasms. ... Carmelo Anthony scored 20 or more points for the 29th consecutive game, tying Richie Guerin's franchise mark set in the 1961-62 season.

A gunman opened fire on the rapper Rick Ross early Monday morning as he drove his Rolls-Royce down East Las Olas Boulevard in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., causing him to lose control of his car and crash into an apartment building, the police said. No one was injured, and the gunman escaped. 
The police said the incident occurred about 5 a.m. near the intersection of Southeast 15th Avenue and East Las Olas Boulevard. Mr. Ross, 37, was driving. His passenger was Shateria L. Moragne-el, 28. Gunfire rang out as he turned east on the boulevard, the police said. Multiple shots were fired, hitting local businesses but missing the car.
As a rapper, Mr. Ross is known for cultivating a persona as a Miami street gangster. He founded the Maybach Music Group, and his most recent album, "God Forgives, I Don't" is nominated this year for the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

THE LOVE SONG OF JONNY VALENTINEBy Teddy Wayne
285 pages. Free Press. $24.99.
''An old soul is the last thing you would expect to find inside Justin Bieber,'' an old entry on his Web site says. ''But all it takes is one listen to the 15-year-old soul-singing phenomenon to realize that he is light years ahead of his manufactured pop peers.'' Mr. Bieber, now 18 and as big a pop star as ever, is the model for the 11-year-old with an old soul in Teddy Wayne's sad-funny, sometimes cutting new novel, ''The Love Song of Jonny Valentine.''
Jonny can seem so much like a young Justin clone that you'd think that Mr. Bieber could sue for copyright infringement. Like the real phenom, Jonny became a tween idol at an absurdly early age: in two years, he has metamorphosed from an ordinary schoolboy into a global heartthrob. He's almost as famous for his cutesy-pie hair as for his soulful voice, and he plays to arenas of screaming girls, one of whom he routinely invites onstage for a tearfully happy serenade. A highlight of his act is a song delivered from a cheesy, dangerous-looking heart-shaped swing that swoops out over the audience. 
Mr. Wayne does deviate, occasionally, from the Bieber story line: he makes Jonny's mother his manager, and his father a missing presence in his life, and has Jonny growing up in St. Louis, not Canada. Yet, for whatever reason, his novel oddly echoes the 2011 authorized documentary ''Justin Bieber: Never Say Never.'' It too features a filmed visit home to memorialize the star's humble roots, and chronicles the grueling work involved in a tour (including a brush with a performance-threatening illness) that will culminate in a blowout show in Madison Square Garden.
Mr. Bieber comes across in that movie -- and in reams and reams of interviews -- as a nice, smart, conscientious and highly groomed young man, who spends a lot of time trying to meet everyone's expectations, thinks about the long-term arc of his career and, in the words of one of his handlers, occasionally gets ''a little whiny'' about not having a normal life. The same is true of Mr. Wayne's narrator, who readily captures the reader's sympathy while conveying the weird isolation and stress that come with pop stardom today.
As he did in his critically acclaimed debut novel, ''Kapitoil'' -- set in 1999 and told from the point of view of a young computer programmer from Qatar who gets a job on Wall Street -- Mr. Wayne seems intent on satirizing the absurdities of late-stage capitalism. In this case he sends up America's obsession with celebrity and the insatiable, implacable fame machine that eats up artists and dreams, lacquers the talented and untalented alike with glitz, and spits out merchandise and publicity in a never-ending cycle of commodification.
Though Mr. Wayne is sometimes only shooting goldfish in a gilded bowl, he does manage to capture the mania of the media and besotted fans, the grinding weariness of a long tour and the cold-eyed strategizing of executives.
Jonny and his business-savvy mother, Jane, meet with two honchos from the record label, who give them a report titled ''Jonny Valentine 2.0 Brand-Extension Strategy'' and suggest setting him up on a date with a girl from their ''stable'' named Lisa Pinto, who could help him expand his reach in the Latino market. Jane is constantly nagging Jonny about his weight and trying to control what he eats -- the plan is to keep him ''slim and boyish'' as long as possible -- and exhorting him to work harder, never mind his exhaustion.
''The top person is never simply the most talented, or the smartest, or the best-looking,'' she tells him. ''They sacrifice anything in their lives that might hold them back.''
Mr. Wayne never lets the reader forget the huge pressures and responsibilities placed on Jonny's slender shoulders -- like all the jobs that would be lost if he were to give up show business -- and he makes us sympathize with Jonny's conflicting desires to please his mother and his business representatives, and his own longing for something resembling an ordinary life.
Jonny frequently vomits before going onstage, and starts sneaking his mother's zolpidem to get to sleep. He also cruises the Internet, seeking clues to his missing father's identity while musing that his dad wouldn't approve of the ''celeb lifestyle'' he and his mother are leading.
No doubt Mr. Wayne has made Jonny even younger than Mr. Bieber (who was 16 when he played his first headlining show in Madison Square Garden) as a way of mocking contemporary pop culture's obsession with youth, but it's a decision that can lead to problems with the book's narration.
Much the way the hyper-articulate John Updike struggled at times to channel his very literary observations and musings through the point of view of Rabbit Angstrom -- an ordinary small-town Toyota salesman -- so Mr. Wayne sometimes struggles to depict the thinking of his 11-year-old hero, a precocious and knowing kid, but an 11-year-old nonetheless.
While Jonny's sophisticated understanding of music is plausible enough -- he is, after all, a genuine prodigy -- it's harder to believe that he would talk about ''the vicious cycle of marketing budgets'' or Michael Jackson's achieving ''a deeper level of cultural penetration'' than he has yet to reach.
What makes Mr. Wayne's portraits of Jonny, his mother and the tour staff so persuasive -- and affecting, in the end -- is his refusal to sentimentalize them, combined with his assiduous avoidance of easy stereotypes. Jane may be a pushy stage mother, going so far as to manipulate her son cruelly to get him to make the most financially advantageous decisions, but she's also a loving and protective parent.
Jonny's bodyguard and tutor, too, may initially seem as if they'd stepped out of central casting, but they also prove to be caring guardians eager to keep their young charge from being hermetically sealed in a celebrity bubble.
As for Jonny, he -- like the hero of ''Kapitoil'' -- is a highly observant and thoughtful narrator, caught up in the swirl of big-time American success, but with growing intimations of its dark side. Mr. Wayne does not reduce him to a showbiz victim -- part of him wants the fame and acclaim as much as his mother -- but neither does he make him one of those pushy wunderkinds, willing to mortgage everything for another step up the ladder of fame.
Instead, Mr. Wayne depicts Jonny as a complicated, searching boy, by turns innocent and sophisticated beyond his years, eager to please and deeply resentful, devoted to his unusual talent and aware of both its rewards and its costs. This is what makes ''The Love Song'' more than a scabrous sendup of American celebrity culture; it's also a poignant portrait of one young artist's coming of age.

Trial Testimony Begins in Officer's Killing

BYLINE: By MOSI SECRET

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 17

LENGTH: 572 words

Testimony in the trial of two men accused of murdering a police officer during a botched robbery attempt began on Monday with accounts from two officers who were present when their colleague, Officer Peter J. Figoski, was killed.
The testimony, delivered in a matter-of-fact manner but occasionally punctuated with tears, offered firsthand details of a case that shocked New York City in December 2011: Officer Figoski, a 22-year veteran of the force and the father of four daughters, responded to a call for backup at a robbery scene in a quiet part of Cypress Hills, Brooklyn, when he was confronted by an assailant who shot him once in the face. He never had the chance to draw his gun.
Officer Figoski's partner, Glenn Estrada, described chasing the man accused of pulling the trigger, Lamont Pride, and arresting him. Afterward Detective Estrada said, he returned to his fallen partner. ''I helped get him into the back of an ambulance,'' he said. 
Officer Figoski's death was the first fatal shooting of a New York City officer in the line of duty since 2007. Mr. Pride and the other defendant, Michael Velez, who prosecutors said was the getaway driver, are on trial in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn on charges of first-degree murder. They face a sentence of up to life in prison if convicted.
The details of the deadly night are largely known. Shortly after Mr. Pride's arrest, a video of his confessing to the shooting was released to the news media. But the testimony recounted Officer Figoski's final moments and the chaotic aftermath, as his colleagues, his daughters and the rest of his family looked on in court.
Detective Estrada, a 15-year patrol veteran in Brooklyn's 75th Precinct, said that Officer Figoski drove the patrol car that night while he manned the radio. They received a call for backup at a burglary in progress.
They drove to 25 Pine Street, near the border with Queens, one of the quieter parts of a precinct known as one of the most dangerous in the city. When they arrived at the single-family house, the man who had called in the burglary stood atop the front stoop, silently pointing down the basement steps, Detective Estrada said.
Officer Figoski disappeared into the basement. From upstairs, Detective Estrada said he heard a single gunshot. The gunman fled, and Detective Estrada chased him. Detective Estrada caught Mr. Pride, handcuffed him and returned his focus to his partner.
He heard an officer calling out on the radio for an ambulance.
A Brooklyn prosecutor, Kenneth Taub, asked Detective Estrada if he had tried to communicate with Officer Figoski. He said he had, but there was no response.
The other police officer who testified, Mario Gandini, said he was already on the scene, in the basement, when Officer Figoski and Detective Estrada arrived. Officer Gandini was tending to a man who had been assaulted during the robbery. The apartment was dark and messy and Mr. Pride was still hiding inside.
The gun popped. Officer Gandini said he walked to the entrance of the basement apartment to see what had happened. First he saw the head of a man at the bottom of the steps with blood coming from his face.
''I looked all the way down to the waist and I saw a revolver,'' he testified. He bit his lower lip. ''Then I knew it was Officer Figoski.''
Officer Figoski was the only officer on duty that night who had a revolver. He turned to his partner. ''It's Pete,'' he said he recalled saying.

And Now for Some Real-Life Enemies

BYLINE: By STEPHEN TOTILO. 
Stephen Totilo is the editor in chief of the gaming site Kotaku.com.

SECTION: Section C; Column 0; The Arts/Cultural Desk; VIDEO GAME REVIEW; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 974 words

Action movies illuminate the anxieties of their age. Their villains represent our fears, or at least those that the filmmakers presume we have. These bad guys are the evil-of-the-moment that we might most want to see punched in the face: Soviet masterminds, drug dealers, Silicon Valley moguls, terrorists, media barons.
Action video games seem to have an advantage over movies here. Audience members don't just watch. They press buttons. They have, via game controllers, a chance for catharsis. 
But many mainstream games, steering clear of almost all social commentary, have remained preoccupied with the hell of war, the coolness of aliens and the ever-present danger that someone out there might want to kidnap Super Mario's girlfriend, Princess Peach. Real-life anxieties are rare. It is apparently hard to concoct an experience that enables players to punch the global economic downturn squarely on the jaw. The new game DmC at least tries.
DmC's opening moments stand out. A barrel-chested bald man in a general's uniform completes a cellphone call with a president he has just threatened to blame for the ruin of the economy. We'll eventually know the bald man as Mundus. He surveys an array of monitors that show offshore drilling platforms. He turns to a haggard, skimpily dressed woman and boasts: ''Soon I will own everything worth owning. I will control the world through debt. I have absolute power.'' We will later learn that he controls his own 24-hour news channel. What's more blood-boiling these days than that?
This guy, in this game, is going to be punched. By you. That's the implicit promise of the medium and the genre.
DmC is the latest video game in the Devil May Cry series born on the PlayStation 2 in late 2001. As before, its playable protagonist is a man named Dante, who needs to kill demons for some greater good, this time in a modern city possessed by them.
To someone only watching them, Devil May Cry games seem like a teenage boy's profane hormonal vision of what the most fantastic adulthood might be like: the adventures of a carefree, impossibly coifed man who enjoys the admiration of sexy women, has easy access to pizza and wields the weapons needed to eliminate the many devils infesting our world.
To those who play them, Devil May Cry games are virtual violence as jazz, with points for variety and deductions for doing the same thing repeatedly. Players have a character to control and demonic enemies to dispatch using an extraordinary mix of sword- , ax- and gun-based maneuvers. The games' creators have mapped dozens of strikes, shots, parries and evasions to different combinations of button presses on a controller. As fingers stretch, reach and tap with purposeful changes in timing, you might guess that this is what a master trumpet player's hands feel like.
To those fingers, the new DmC is familiar, though less stressful than its predecessors. Like so many modern games, it is easier than those before it. Our hero is tougher, and survival through the game's 10 hours is all but guaranteed. Going unhit, however, remains a challenge that will be met only by those players swift of reflex and interested in improv.
To the eyes and ears, the new DmC has just a little more to do with things that might matter to an adult. The debt-obsessed master villain ensures this. Dante himself remains a fantasy of puberty, opening this game in bed with two attractive women before reluctantly assuming responsibility for fighting an evil only he, of course, can defeat to save the world. But what wakes him feels more real. There's a report blaring on the Raptor News Network, the game's fake Fox News, about supposed terrorist threats that turn out to be the exhortations of the in-game version of Occupy activists or Anonymous hacktivists. Bob Barbas, who is Raptor's Bill O'Reilly, grumbles about these people and then wishes aloud that someone would shoot them. The game assumes you might have an opinion about this. That's new for this series.
It doesn't take long to deduce that DmC's main economy-wrecking bad guy is a demon king, and that Bob Barbas is a demon minion. That is its own kind of simple, blame-absolving fantasy. DmC isn't asking us to think too much.
Players spend most of the time fighting street-level demons who neither invite nor evoke any social commentary. The eventual confrontation with Mundus feels disappointingly less like recession revenge and more like a clip from a monster movie, though the scene preceding it -- a climb up the floors of a skyscraper in which employees have been motivated with the slogans ''Sell More Debt'' and ''Greed Is Great'' -- will fit a time capsule well.
The showdown with Barbas is more specific and perhaps contains a bit of acting out against news media that have had so much to say about violent games. Dante plunges into a city's reflection in a river and approaches an inversion of the Raptor News tower. He walks on the underside in this flipped cityscape; at this moment, the whole scene is upside down. The player and Dante find Raptor's core, where a huge digitized version of Barbas's head taunts and attacks with cackles and energy beams. It's Dante's demon-fighting skills versus an avatar of punditry.
Mr. O'Reilly isn't the only possible target here and maybe not even the most apt. But while DmC may tease and then fail to deliver the satisfaction of giving those responsible for the great recession a hearty wallop, it offers this consolation prize. In DmC we can't vicariously slay that which would destroy real society, but we can at least have a showdown with an entity whose contributions are dubious: a television talking head.
DmC, developed by Ninja Theory and published by Capcom Entertainment, is available for the PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. It is rated M (Mature) for gore, intense violence, nudity and strong language.

Chaos and Lawlessness Grow After Days of Unrest in Egypt

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK and MAYY EL SHEIKH; Kareem Fahim contributed reporting from Cairo.

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 10

LENGTH: 1454 words

PORT SAID, Egypt -- The police fired indiscriminately into the streets outside their besieged station, a group of protesters arrived with a crate of gasoline bombs, and others cheered a masked man on a motorcycle who arrived with a Kalashnikov.
The growing chaos along the vital canal zone showed little sign of abating on Monday as President Mohamed Morsi called out the army to try to regain control of three cities along the Suez Canal whose growing lawlessness is testing the integrity of the Egyptian state.
In Port Said, street battles reached a bloody new peak with a death toll over three days of at least 45, with at least five more protesters killed by bullet wounds, hospital officials said.
President Morsi had already declared a monthlong state of emergency here and in the other canal towns of Suez and Ismailia, applying a law that virtually eliminates due process protections against abuse by the police. Angry crowds burned tires and hurled rocks at the police. And the police, with little training and less credibility, hunkered down behind barrages of tear gas, birdshot and occasional bullets. 
The sense that the state was unraveling may have been strongest here in Port Said, where demonstrators have proclaimed their city an independent nation. But in recent days, the unrest has risen in towns across the country and in Cairo as well. In the capital on Monday, a mob of protesters managed to steal an armored police vehicle, drive it to Tahrir Square and make it a bonfire.
After two years of torturous transition, Egyptians have watched with growing anxiety as the erosion of the public trust in the government and a persistent security vacuum have fostered a new temptation to resort to violence to resolve disputes, said Michael Hanna, a researcher at the New York-based Century Foundation who is now in Cairo. ''There is a clear political crisis that has eroded the moral authority of the state,'' he said.
And the spectacular evaporation of the government's authority here in Port Said has put that crisis on vivid display, most conspicuously in the rejection of Mr. Morsi's declarations of the curfew and state of emergency.
As in Suez and Ismailia, tens of thousands of residents of Port Said poured into the streets in defiance just as a 9 p.m. curfew was set to begin. Bursts of gunfire echoed through the city for the next hours, and from 9 to 11 p.m. hospital officials raised the death count to seven from two.
When two armored personnel carriers approached a funeral Monday morning for some of the seven protesters killed the day before, a stone-throwing mob of thousands quickly chased them away. And within a few hours, the demonstrators had resumed their siege of a nearby police station, burning tires to create a smoke screen to hide behind amid tear gas and gunfire.
Many in the city said they saw no alternative but to continue to stay in the streets. They complained that the hated security police remained unchanged and unaccountable even after President Hosni Mubarak was ousted two years ago. Protesters saw no recourse in the justice system, which is also unchanged; they dismissed the courts as politicized, especially after the acquittals of all those accused of killing protesters during the revolution. Then came the death sentences handed down Saturday to 21 Port Said soccer fans for their role in a deadly brawl. The death sentences set off the current unrest in this city.
Nor, the people said, did they trust the political process that brought to power Mr. Morsi and his Islamist allies in the Muslim Brotherhood. He had vowed to usher in the rule of law as ''a president for all Egyptians.'' But in November, he used a presidential decree to temporarily stifle potential legal objections so that his Islamist allies could rush out a new Constitution. His authoritarian move kicked off a sharp uptick in street violence leading to this weekend's Port Said clashes.
''Injustice beyond imagination,'' one man outside the morning funeral said of Mr. Morsi's emergency decree, before he was drowned out by a crowd of others echoing the sentiment.
''He declared a curfew, and we declare civil disobedience,'' another man said.
''This doesn't apply to Port Said because we don't recognize him as our president,'' said a third. ''He is the president of the Muslim Brotherhood only.''
Officials of the Muslim Brotherhood and its party could not be reached. The group had recently moved offices because of security threats, and at the new office, neighbors said Brotherhood officials had not appeared since the start of the unrest.
As tens of thousands marched to the cemetery, many echoed the arguments of human rights advocates that the one-month imposition of the emergency law and reliance on the military would only aggravate the problem. The emergency law rolled back legal procedures meant to protect individuals from excessive violence by the police, while the reliance on soldiers to keep the peace further reduced individual rights by sending any civilians arrested to military trials.
''It is stupid -- he is repressing people for one more month!'' one man argued to a friend. ''It will explode in his face. He should let people cool down.''
The police remained besieged in their burned-out stations, glimpsed only occasionally crouching with their automatic rifles behind the low roof ledges.
When one showed his head over a police building as the funeral march passed, voices in the crowd shouted that his appearance was a ''provocation'' and people began hurling rocks. Others riding a pickup in the procession had stockpiled homemade bombs for later use.
In a departure from most previous clashes around the Egyptian revolution, in Port Said the police also faced armed assailants. Two were seen with handguns on Monday around a siege of a police station, in addition to the man with the Kalashnikov.
Earlier, a man accosted an Egyptian journalist working for The New York Times. ''If I see you taking pictures of protesters with weapons, I will kill you,'' he warned.
Defending their stations, the police fought back, and in Cairo they battled their own commander, the interior minister.
Brotherhood leaders say Mr. Morsi has been afraid to name an outsider as minister for fear of a police revolt, putting off any meaningful reform of the Mubarak security services. But when Mr. Morsi recently tapped a veteran ministry official, Mohamed Ibrahim, for the job, many in the security services complained that even the appointment of one insider to replace another was undue interference.
In a measure of the low level of the new government's top-down control over the security forces, officers even cursed and chased away their new interior minister when he tried to attend a funeral on Friday for two members of the security forces killed in the recent clashes.
''What do you mean we won't be armed? We would be disarmed to die,'' one shouted, on a video recording of the event.
In an attempt to placate the rank and file, Mr. Ibrahim issued a statement to police personnel sympathizing with the pressure the protests put on them. Later, he promised them sophisticated weapons.
''That can only be a recipe for future bloodshed,'' said Hossam Bahgat, executive director of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, which monitors police abuses.
By turning to the military, Mr. Morsi signaled that he understood he could not rely on the police to pacify the streets, Mr. Bahgat argued.
But it was far from clear that Mr. Morsi was fully in command of the military either. The new Islamist-backed Constitution grants the general broad autonomy within the Egyptian government in an apparent quid pro quo for turning over full power to President Morsi in August. Mr. Morsi's formal request for the military to restore order was ''not so much an instruction as a plea for support,'' Mr. Bahgat said.
It remains to be seen whether the military retains the credibility to quell the protests. The soldiers stationed in Port Said did nothing to intervene as clashes raged on in the streets hours after curfew Monday night.
Analysts close to the military say its officers are extremely reluctant to engage in the kind of harsh crackdown that would damage its reputation with Egyptians, preferring to rely on its presence alone.
Near the front lines of the clashes, residents debated whether they would welcome a military takeover. ''The military that was sent to Port Said is the Muslim Brotherhood's military,'' said one man, dismissing its independence from Mr. Morsi.
But others said they still had faith in the institution, if not in its top generals. ''In the military, the soldiers are our brothers,'' said Khaled Samir Abdullah, 25. Pointing to the police, he said, ''those ones are merciless.''

A Prosecutor Loath to Say 'Not Guilty'

BYLINE: By MICHAEL POWELL.

The freedom walk of the recently imprisoned is unavoidably moving.
Slim, with cropped hair flecked with the silver of middle-age, William Lopez walks down Jay Street in a khaki jacket and pants, a white shirt unbuttoned to mid-chest. Afternoon shadows have gone cobalt blue, and the thermometer offers a miserly 19 degrees. Mr. Lopez waves off a scarf. He keeps taking great gulps of air, the steam girdling his face. He peers about, wary his stroll might end.
Disbelief is understandable. Mr. Lopez, 54, has spent the past 23 years in prison for a murder that a federal judge now says he never committed. 
''It feels,'' Mr. Lopez says, ''great to be back on earth.''
Whether he remains on terra firma depends on Charles J. Hynes, the Brooklyn district attorney, who must decide if he will appeal a car wreck of a two-decade-old case. Mr. Hynes strongly suggests that he will appeal. Asked about the federal court decision that excoriated his office, Mr. Hynes shrugs. ''Second-guessing is what was going on,'' he says. ''It had serious problems, as many trials do.''
Mr. Hynes has a long, often honorable record. He has pioneered programs for young men accused of drug offenses, sluicing them away from prison. Dawn Ryan, a top Legal Aid lawyer, notes that Mr. Hynes's emphasis on treatment and community outreach ''places him way beyond'' other prosecutors. But the occupational hazard of the long-serving public official is to develop an immunity to doubt.
Mr. Hynes has recently had a run of cases of men who served long stretches in prison for crimes they did not commit. With an election looming this year, he sat to talk about these cases.
Asked about Jabbar Collins, who served 16 years for the murder of a rabbi before a judge freed him, Mr. Hynes insisted: ''We believe he did it.'' The case collapsed in a hideous heap.
Of Ronald Bozeman, 65, who was released late last year after serving a year on charges that Mr. Hynes acknowledged had fallen apart, the district attorney insisted that ''it was our investigation that revealed the problems.'' That explanation requires you to ignore that it took his office months to hand over information to the defense lawyer.
Then there is Mr. Lopez. Federal District Judge Nicholas G. Garaufis began his decision: ''The case of William Lopez began 23 years ago. It was rotten from Day 1.'' He wrote: ''The prosecution's evidence was flimsy to begin with and has since been reduced to rubble by facts arising after trial.''
Mr. Lopez, who had a serious drug habit, was accused of walking into a Brighton Beach crack house and shooting a dealer in the stomach with a shotgun. His case was pockmarked with problems. Alibi witnesses were never called to testify. There was no murder weapon or forensic evidence.
The case featured two witnesses. A female drug dealer described a 6-foot-3-inch shooter. He was, she testified, ''dark, tall, dark, black.'' Mr. Lopez is a wiry 5-foot-7, and milky skinned. The other witness was a prostitute and marathon crack smoker, having inhaled 10 to 12 vials of the drug in the two hours before the shooting. Depending on her testimony, she saw or heard the shooting. When she got to Rikers Island, she told her cellmate that she had made it up. She said that she had set up the dead drug dealer and that a friend of hers killed him.
The prosecutor did not give this information to the defense lawyer until the jury had returned its verdict. After Mr. Lopez's conviction, the lawyer required open-heart surgery, so another lawyer, Irving Anolik, stood in. He told the state court judge he was ''totally unprepared'' to handle the sentencing. The judge waved off that cavil.
Late last fall, Mr. Lopez's appeals lawyer, Richard Levitt, located a former drug dealer who lives in the Dominican Republic. This man was in the crack house that night, witnessed the killing and testified that he was ''certain'' that Mr. Lopez was not the killer.
The late 1980s were blood-drenched years. It is not surprising that some juries might have voted to march some men off to prison on frail reeds of evidence.
But Mr. Hynes's insistence that he can ignore the case's embarrassing scars is difficult to understand. The judge ''didn't like the case,'' he said, adding, ''The test is not whether you didn't like it.''
Why, I ask Mr. Hynes, appeal this busted valise of a case? Mr. Lopez had an impeccable behavior record in prison. There is a strong chance he's innocent, and a stronger chance still that no jury will convict him again.
Mr. Hynes shrugs. ''Because you're supposed to uphold the rule of law,'' he says. Left unmentioned is the question of common sense.

Hearing in Connecticut Reflects Divide on Guns

BYLINE: By RAY RIVERA and PETER APPLEBOME

LENGTH: 921 words

HARTFORD -- Victims of gun violence, burly men clad in hunting jackets and National Rifle Association hats, mothers wearing stickers reading ''We Demand Change Now.''
They were among hundreds of people who packed into the State Capitol on Monday for a charged and often emotional hearing on gun laws. The turnout highlighted the deep divisions in a state that has become a focal point of the national gun control debate since the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown last month that killed 20 children and 6 adult staff members.
Among those to testify Monday were parents of some of the youngest Newtown victims, who took opposing sides. 
''The sole purpose of those AR-15s or AK-47s is to put a lot of lead out on the battlefield quickly, and that's what they do and that's what they did at Sandy Hook Elementary School,'' said Neil Heslin, whose 6-year-old son, Jesse Lewis, was a victim. Mr. Heslin told lawmakers that he had grown up around guns and was the son of an avid hunter, but that he believed that there was no reason any citizen should have an assault-style weapon like the one used to kill his son.
''That wasn't just a killing. That was a massacre,'' he said. ''Those children and those victims were shot apart. And my son was one of them.''
But Mark Mattioli, whose son James, 6, was also killed at Sandy Hook Elementary on Dec. 14, said: ''I believe in a few simple gun laws. I think we have more than enough on the books. We should hold people individually accountable for their actions.''
Mr. Mattioli said he also thought some liberals were using the attack in Newtown to spread fear on gun issues.
''The problem is not gun laws,'' he added. ''The problem is a lack of civility.''
The hearing, one of several scheduled by the legislature's Bipartisan Task Force on Gun Violence Prevention and Children's Safety, was expected to run deep into the night. Nearly 1,500 people, including family members, gun control advocates, gun rights advocates and gun industry representatives, had signed up or were invited to testify, although it was not clear how many would get the chance. The task force hopes to have legislation prepared for passage by the end of February.
Outside the building, people braved frigid temperatures and driving snow while waiting to pass through metal detectors, part of the heightened security measures for the hearing. Women from groups like March for Change and One Million Moms for Gun Control, which are calling for stricter gun laws, stood far outnumbered by gun rights supporters, most of them men.
One man carried a sign reading ''Gun Control Does Not Make You Safer.'' Another wore a jacket that said ''N.R.A. Empowerment Member.''
David Gentry, a personal trainer from Stamford, wore a holster on his waist with a copy of the Constitution tucked in it. ''I just feel that's where the conversation should start,'' he said.
Mr. Gentry, a father of two, said he was saddened by the Newtown massacre but also worried about ''knee-jerk reactions'' to it. Immediately after the attack, he said, he renewed his N.R.A. membership, bought four N.R.A. T-shirts and decided to attend the hearing on Monday to oppose stricter gun proposals.
''There are things we can do in this country to help secure our children and improve firearms safety,'' he said. ''Better training, securing firearms, yet not making them inaccessible to authorized owners.''
Kori Hammel, a musician and mother from Stratford, came with March for Change.
''Sandy Hook was 10 minutes from where I grew up,'' she said. ''I just can't act like everything is O.K.''
Inside the hearing room, gun rights supporters wore round yellow stickers reading ''Another Responsible Gun Owner.'' People on the other side of the issue wore green ribbons, which have become a symbol of the Newtown tragedy.
Connecticut is considered to have some of the strictest gun control laws in the country. But gun ownership has been on the rise, and the gun industry and pro-gun groups have flexed more muscle in Hartford in recent years. Last year, gun rights advocates showed up by the hundreds at a hearing to oppose legislation that would have restricted high-capacity ammunition magazines like the ones used by Adam Lanza in the Newtown massacre.
On Monday, the state's gun manufacturers said they supported stricter background checks but warned the task force against legislation they said could harm the state's historic gun industry. Connecticut is the nation's seventh-largest maker of firearms.
''We have a reason to consider the ramifications on the firearms industry that has contributed much to the state's history and culture and continues to play a vital role,'' said Dennis Veilleux, president and chief executive of Colt Manufacturing, which has been based in Connecticut since the mid-19th century.
Robert Crook, president of the Coalition of Connecticut Sportsmen, a gun rights lobbying group, said none of the gun control bills floating around Hartford would have stopped Mr. Lanza and would instead restrict the rights of lawful gun owners.
''Remember, gun owners are the good guys,'' he said.
The testimony was marked by plenty of poignant moments.
Veronique Pozner, whose son Noah died in the attack, showed task force members the last picture taken of her son the night before the shooting as she urged broad new restrictions.
She recalled her son's inquisitive nature. ''He used to ask, 'If there are bad guys out there, why can't they just all wake up one day and decide to be good?' ''
Ms. Pozner said she did not always have an answer.

Band's Bodies Likely Found In Mexico

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 10

LENGTH: 459 words

MEXICO CITY -- Several bodies found in a well in northern Mexico appear to be members of a large, popular musical group and its crew who were reported abducted at gunpoint last week after a performance. 
The authorities on Monday identified four of the dead, all shot to death, as members of the group and said there were indications that the other eight bodies were also group members.
Officials in Nuevo Leףn State, which is near the Texas border and one of Mexico's most violent, said 12 bodies were found on Sunday and Monday, a few days after 18 members of the band, Kombo Kolombia, and its crew were reported missing after a performance Thursday night. Investigators were draining the well and trying to determine if there were more bodies in the area.
Jorge Domene, a spokesman for the Nuevo Leףn government, said at a news conference Monday evening that investigators were led to the site by a group member who had escaped. The survivor said gunmen had abducted the group and shot them for reasons not yet determined.
''This was a direct attack,'' Mr. Domene said. ''It was not random.''
Family members reported the musicians missing on Friday after losing cellphone contact not long after the band, which specializes in a Colombian-style folk music called vallenato, played at a bar near Sabinas Hidalgo, about 30 miles north of Monterrey.
The governor of the state, Rodrigo Medina de la Cruz, in an interview with a local television station there, promised to find the band and capture any culprits. ''We are going to continue looking for them,'' he said. ''We are also going to investigate to find the motive, why it happened and, in the event that the taking of their lives is confirmed, what was behind this and of course capturing those that did it.''
It is not unusual for drug gangs in Mexico to kill or assault musicians, especially those who play so-called narcocorridos that glorify the criminal underworld and end up offending well-armed listeners. A number of cities have banned that kind of music because of the violence that can accompany it.
But Kombo Kolombia was not known for that kind of music, favoring romantic, accordion-tinged folk ballads with titles like ''Only You Make Me Happy.''
Mass kidnappings, too, are not uncommon, either for ransom, robbery, the result of mistaken identity or to terrorize rivals.
But the disappearance of the band drew national attention and served as a reminder of the security challenges facing the administration of President Enrique Peסa Nieto, who took office Dec. 1 with a vow to reduce violence.
Members of the president's security cabinet were meeting on Monday in Mexico State, which surrounds Mexico City, after an outbreak of violence there that has left some 70 people dead in the past month.

Reliving Horror and Faint Hope at Massacre Site

BYLINE: By RAY RIVERA

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 1574 words

NEWTOWN, Conn. -- The gunfire ended; it was so quiet they could hear the broken glass and bullet casings scraping under their boots. The smell of gunpowder filled the air. The officers turned down their radios; they did not want to give away their positions if there was still a gunman present.
They found the two women first, their bodies lying on the lobby floor. Now they knew it was real. But nothing, no amount of training, could prepare them for what they found next, inside those two classrooms.
''One look, and your life was absolutely changed,'' said Michael McGowan, one of the first police officers to arrive at Sandy Hook Elementary School on Dec. 14, as a gunman, in the space of minutes, killed 20 first graders and 6 adults. 
Officer McGowan was among seven Newtown officers who recently sat down to share their accounts of that day. Some spoke for the first time, providing the fullest account yet of the scene as officers responded to one of the worst school massacres in United States history, one that has inflamed the national debate over gun control.
It is an account filled with ghastly moments and details, and a few faint instances of hope. One child had a slight pulse, but did not survive. Another was found bloody but unhurt, amid her dead classmates. Teachers were so protective of their students that they had to be coaxed by officers before opening doors. And the officers themselves, many of them fathers, instinctively used their most soothing Daddy voices to guide terrified children to safety.
The stories also reveal the deep stress that lingers for officers who, until Dec. 14, had focused their energies on maintaining order in a low-crime corner of suburbia. Some can barely sleep. Little things can set off tears: a television show, a child's laughter, even the piles of gifts the Police Department received from across the country.
One detective, who was driving with his wife and two sons, passed a roadside memorial on Route 25 two weeks after the shooting, and began sobbing uncontrollably. ''I just lost it right there, I couldn't even drive,'' the detective, Jason Frank, said.
Officer William Chapman was in the Newtown police station along with Officer McGowan and others when the first reports of shots and breaking glass came in early on the day of the massacre. The school was more than two miles away. They traveled up Route 25, then right onto Church Hill Road. ''We drove as fast as we've ever driven,'' Officer McGowan said.
They made it in under three minutes, arriving in the parking lot while gunfire could still be heard.
''I got out of the car and grabbed my rifle and it stopped for second,'' Officer Chapman said. ''But then we heard more popping. You could tell it was rifle fire. And it was up so close, it sounded like it was coming from outside. So we were all looking around for someone to shoot back at.''
As the officers converged on the building, the gunfire stopped again. Officers Chapman and Scott Smith made their way to the front entrance. It was here, only minutes earlier, that a rail-thin 20-year-old named Adam Lanza, armed with a .223 Bushmaster semiautomatic carbine, two semiautomatic pistols and hundreds of rounds of ammunition, had blasted his way through the glass.
Leonard Penna, a school resource officer who had raced to the scene from his office at the Newtown Middle School, entered the school with Sgt. Aaron Bahamonde and Lt. Christopher Vanghele, through a side door that leads to the boiler room, he said. Officer McGowan and two other officers entered through a locked rear door. One of them knocked out the glass with his rifle butt so the rest of the officers could get in.
The halls were familiar to Officer McGowan. He attended the school as a child. But now, they were eerily silent.
''The teachers were doing a phenomenal job keeping their kids quiet,'' Officer Chapman said.
The officers turned their radios down. They entered the front lobby and saw the first bodies, those of Dawn Hochsprung, the principal, they would later learn, and Mary Sherlach, the school psychologist.
''You saw them lifeless, laying down,'' Officer Penna recalled. ''For a split second, your mind says could this be a mock crime scene, could this be fake, but in the next split second, you're saying, there is no way. This is real.''
The officers went from room to room, urgently hunting for the killer before he could do more harm.
They found a wounded staff member in one room, made sure her co-workers were applying proper first aid and moved on.
As Officers Chapman and Smith approached the second classroom in the hallway on their left, they spotted a rifle on the floor. Inside, they found the gunman, Adam Lanza, dead by his own hand, along with the bodies of several children and other adults.
The officers searched the room for any other gunmen, then began searching for signs of life among the children. One little girl had a pulse and was breathing. Officer Chapman cradled her in his arms and ran with her outside, to an ambulance. Officer Chapman, a parent himself, tried to comfort her. ''You're safe now; your parents love you,'' he recalled saying. She did not survive.
Most of the bodies were found in the classroom next door, where, Detective Frank recalled, ''the teacher had them huddled up like a mother hen -- simple as that, in a corner.''
Officer Penna, who was the first officer to enter the second room, found a girl standing alone amid the bodies. She appeared to be in shock, and was covered in blood, but had not been injured. He, not knowing the gunman had been found, told her to stay put.
He ran into the next classroom and saw the dead gunman, with Officers Chapman and Smith standing nearby. State troopers and other officers were now flooding in. Officer Penna returned to the second classroom, his rifle slung around his chest, grabbed the uninjured girl by the arm and ran with her out to a triage area set up in the parking lot.
With state troopers coming in, the officers began to evacuate the children who were still behind locked doors. But many of the teachers, seeking to protect their students and following their own training, refused to open up.
''We're kicking the doors, yelling 'Police! Police!' '' Officer McGowan said. ''We were ripping our badges off and putting them up to the window.''
Detective Frank, who had been off duty and rushed to the scene so quickly that he had to borrow a gun from a colleague once he arrived, remembers ripping the handle off one of the doors, ''just trying to get through.''
As the children emerged, the officers tried to reassure them. ''Everything is fine now,'' they said, even as they stayed alert for a possible second gunman. ''Everybody hold hands, close your eyes,'' they told the children.
Some officers formed a human curtain around the bodies of Ms. Hochsprung and Ms. Sherlach, to shield the children from the sight as they filed past. Others blocked the doorways of the two classrooms.
As the scene settled that day, officers standing guard outside warned newly arriving colleagues not to go in if they had children. Detective Joe Joudy, one of the senior members of the force, spotted Officer Chapman walking back to the building, covered in blood. ''I was a mess, and he looks at me and says, 'They've got to get you guys out of here,' '' Officer Chapman said.
Newtown's three-man detective squad, which also included Dan McAnaspie, would spend much of the next week working with the State Police to collect and inventory every bit of evidence from the crime scene.
''Words can't describe how horrible it was,'' said Detective Joudy, who has been with the department for 27 years.
As he left the building that day, Officer Tom Bean, who had also been off duty when he rushed to the scene, realized he had not told his wife where he was. He fumbled for his phone in the parking lot, and called her. ''That's when I broke down in tears, crying,'' he said.
More than a month later, the officers continue to feel the pain of that day. Some spoke reluctantly, not wanting to compare their torment with the agony of the families of the children and adult victims. But they also worried about their ability to do their jobs, as they continue to suffer. They said they omitted some details out of sensitivity to the victims, and to protect the investigation as it continued.
At least one person, Officer Bean, said he has already received a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. He said he had been unable to return to work since the shootings, and had needed medication to sleep.
The officers and their union are reaching out to state lawmakers, hoping to expand workers' compensation benefits to include those who witness horrific violence.
''Our concern from the beginning has been the effects of PTSD,'' said Eric Brown, a lawyer for the union that represents the Newtown police. ''We estimate it is probably going to be 12 to 15 Newtown officers who are going to be dealing with that, for the remainder of their careers, we imagine, from what we've been told by professionals who deal with PTSD.''
For Detective Frank, who spent days sequestered in the school, meticulously collecting evidence, the images keep recurring -- and not just of the children. The monster-truck backpack he found that was identical to his 6-year-old's. The Christmas ornaments that sat unfinished, drying on the windowsill.
''It's heartbreaking,'' he said. ''These kids will never take those ornaments home to their parents.''

Security Shares Spotlight at High School Game

BYLINE: By BEN STRAUSS

CHICAGO -- The cars were screened in the parking lots of the stadium on Chicago State University's South Side campus. The fans walked through metal detectors; their bags were scanned, too. Police lined the arena's entrance. The teams of teenage boys wore T-shirts during the pregame warm-ups bearing a simple, yet stark message: Shoot Hoops, Not Guns.
Such was the backdrop for a highly anticipated high school basketball game in Chicago on Saturday between Simeon Career Academy and Whitney M. Young Magnet High School, where a pall cast by violence threatened to overshadow an athletic showcase. On Jan. 16, after a game involving Simeon at Chicago State, a skirmish between players and coaches broke out on the court. A shooting outside the arena later left a 17-year-old boy dead -- another homicide in a city where 506 were reported in 2012. 
The game pitted two of the country's top programs and players, with both teams in USA Today's top 10 national rankings. According to Rivals.com, Whitney Young boasts the top junior in the nation in Jahlil Okafor, a powerful but lithe center with soft hands and quick feet. Simeon has Jabari Parker, the third-ranked senior. Parker is a 6-foot-8 do-it-all swingman who committed to Duke last month and has been featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated.
''You could make a case these are the two best high school players in the country,'' said Joe Henricksen, a longtime Chicago high school basketball observer and the publisher of a local recruiting newsletter.
The hype surrounding the clash, which was televised nationally on ESPNU, was matched by the questions of safety and security. Fans erupted during the game after acrobatic dunks, while the Chicago police superintendent, Garry F. McCarthy, sat with his arms folded, wearing a tight-lipped expression.
McCarthy described the security as threefold, a perimeter enforced by the Chicago police, the campus patrolled by state officers and the university police, and Chicago Public Schools security monitoring the gym.
He stressed that the Jan. 16 shooting was not related to basketball.
''The fact is it had nothing to do with what happened at the game,'' McCarthy said. ''That was about a gang member seeing another gang member, relaying the information, and somebody showed up and wanted to shoot somebody.''
Still, Chicago Public Schools suspended Simeon Coach Robert Smith for four games because of his role in the pushing and shoving after the game, and the security presence inside and outside the arena Saturday was noticeably increased and tightened. One fan said police officers with flashlights peered through his car window and asked him to open his glove compartment when he entered the parking lot.
''I'm always concerned about our kids' safety,'' said the Chicago schools chief executive, Barbara Byrd-Bennett, who was also at Saturday's game.
She added: ''I think they know we've put together a plan to keep them safe.''
In Chicago, high school basketball is a way of life. The term March Madness was used to describe the high school basketball postseason tournament in Illinois in 1939, long before the N.C.A.A. adopted it, and Illinois was also among the first states to televise its tournament.
More recently, Chicago produced the N.B.A.'s first overall draft picks when Derrick Rose, a Simeon graduate, was selected by the Bulls in 2008, and last year when the New Orleans Hornets chose Anthony Davis. Many in the city hope its latest prodigies follow suit.
''Basketball is just what we do in Chicago,'' Whitney Young Coach Tyrone Slaughter said.
The remarkable run of talent here has brought comparisons to the late 1970s, when Isiah Thomas and Doc Rivers headlined high school tournaments in the area. But as rich as the basketball culture is locally, the sport has also been affected by the reverberations from violent crime. Outside their gym each day they go to practice, Parker and his teammates see Rose's jersey hanging next to that of Ben Wilson, who was ranked among the top high school basketball stars in the country when he was killed in a shooting outside Simeon in 1984.
A report by The Chicago Sun-Times last week highlighted several violent episodes involving public school athletics in the city over the past 10 years, including fights, shootings and an attack on a team bus.
''That's never on my mind, any of the violence,'' the Whitney Young center Okafor said. ''I feel safe.''
The game, as it turned out, matched the hype, despite ordinary efforts from Parker (7 points) and Okafor (8 points). Simeon sprinted to a lead before holding off Whitney Young, 44-41, in an action-packed finish.
Afterward, Parker said just playing the game was an important message.
''We could have played it somewhere else outside the city, but we didn't,'' he said. ''Those T-shirts we wore were good for kids to see.''
Fans filing out of the arena were instructed to exit through the side of the building, directly into the parking lot. Police cars sat at the entrance to the arena and in the surrounding lots, their blue lights flashing in the night. No problems were reported.

Original Suspect Is Cleared In Texas Campus Shooting

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 14

LENGTH: 453 words

HOUSTON -- Prosecutors dismissed charges Monday against the 22-year-old student accused of being the gunman in a shooting here last week at a community college campus, an episode that generated widespread news coverage as many feared a mass shooting. 
The authorities said the focus of their investigation had shifted in recent days from the initial suspect, Carlton N. Berry Jr., to another student, Trey Foster, also 22. They charged Mr. Foster with two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon in the shooting, which caused the evacuation of the North Harris campus of Lone Star College last Tuesday and sent four people to hospitals.
Adrian Garcia, the Harris County sheriff, defended the decision to arrest and file charges against Mr. Berry, saying that two people who were shot initially identified him as the gunman and that Mr. Berry at first told investigators that he knew nothing about the case. Sheriff Garcia added that the investigation was not a television show with a clear-cut story line.
''This is more like reality TV, where life is complicated and includes the type of chaos and complexities that our investigators deal with on a daily basis,'' Sheriff Garcia told reporters Monday, adding of his investigators: ''They did what they were supposed to do.''
A prosecutor with the Harris County district attorney's office said dropping charges against Mr. Berry was ''in the interest of justice at this time.''
The shooting stemmed from the most minor of disputes: two friends who were students, Mr. Foster and Mr. Berry, were walking on campus when another man, Jody Neal, 25, bumped Mr. Foster, according to court documents. An argument ensued. About 30 minutes later, when Mr. Foster and Mr. Berry saw Mr. Neal once more, the argument continued, and Mr. Foster pulled out a .40-caliber pistol and fired at Mr. Neal, according to the authorities and the documents.
Mr. Neal, a G.E.D. student, was shot, as was Mr. Berry and a maintenance worker whom the authorities described as a bystander. A fourth person was not shot but had an anxiety attack and was hospitalized, the authorities said.
Mr. Foster fled the Houston area and remained missing until he was caught in Plano, near Dallas. It was only after charges were filed against Mr. Berry that Mr. Berry began speaking to investigators, and ended up identifying Mr. Foster as the gunman, Sheriff Garcia said.
At a news conference last week in which officials identified Mr. Berry as the gunman, the sheriff suggested that Mr. Berry had a ''peanut-size brain'' for taking a firearm to campus to settle an argument. On Monday, the sheriff was unapologetic.
''I owe him no apology,'' he said. ''This is an investigation that is still in progress.''

A New Push on Domestic Violence

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; EDITORIAL; Pg. 22

LENGTH: 371 words

Turning to a critical piece of unfinished business, Patrick Leahy, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, joined last week with a Republican colleague, Michael Crapo of Idaho, to reintroduce legislation to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, the 1994 law central to the nation's efforts to fight domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking. 
Their bill cleared the Senate last April in a 68-to-31 vote, but it was blocked in the Republican-led House largely over provisions that would expand protections against abuse for gay and immigrant victims.
The reintroduced Senate bill would provide services, like shelters and legal help, for victims of abuse regardless of their sexual orientation or immigration status. But it omits the original bill's modest increase in the number of special visas, known as U-visas, available to undocumented immigrants who are victims of domestic violence and sexual assaults.
House Republicans opposed any increase in that number and sought to end the current ability of U-visa holders to apply for permanent residency after three years, a move that would have eliminated an important incentive for frightened victims to contact law enforcement and assist in prosecutions. (They also noted that there was a procedural problem with having a U-visa fee in the original Senate bill.) The new bill also incorporates steps to reduce the inexcusable national backlog of untested rape kits. These changes might make it easier to push this legislation through the House.
In the meantime, the Senate needs to take up the bill as soon as possible before its schedule and attention is fully focused on other big legislative priorities, like gun violence, immigration reform and debt reduction.
There is no need for another set of hearings or another Judiciary Committee vote. The Senate's majority leader, Harry Reid, should use the window before Congress breaks for its Presidents' Day recess in February to secure Senate passage of the latest version of the Leahy-Crapo bill. That move would help put pressure on Speaker John Boehner and other Republican leaders in the House to stop playing ideological games and reach agreement with the Senate on extending this lifesaving law.

Bipartisan Hunting Buddies

BYLINE: By JAMES A. BAKER III and JOHN D. DINGELL. 
James A. Baker III was secretary of the Treasury from 1985 to 1988 and secretary of state from 1989 to 1992. Representative , John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, is the dean of the House and currently the longest-serving member of Congress.

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; OP-ED CONTRIBUTORS; Pg. 27

LENGTH: 747 words

WE are as different as North and South. One of us, John Dingell, is a liberal Michigan Democrat and the other, Jim Baker, is a conservative Texas Republican. We met during the Reagan administration and have often found ourselves on opposite sides of political battles. We have the bruises to show for them.
We do, however, share some beliefs. One is a strong love of guns and the outdoors and, just as important, a respect for both. Since we were boys, some of our best times have come with rifles or shotguns in our hands, especially when hunting with our fathers. Jim hunted ducks in the wetlands of southeast Texas and elk in the Rocky Mountains. John hunted small game along the banks of the Detroit River and Lake Erie. As adults, we have hunted together, using our common bond to bridge our differences. 
We're also united by outrage over the rampage killings in an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., and other despicable episodes of gun violence. At the same time, we believe the Second Amendment provides Americans with an important freedom that makes our country special.
But the harsh truth is that too many Americans are dying from gun-related shootings -- more than 30,000 each year and more than one million since 1960. Gun violence now rivals traffic accidents as the leading cause of death by injury in the United States. Quite simply, gun violence threatens to overwhelm us.
Americans are grappling for strategies to make sure that the horror that occurred in Newtown isn't repeated. The White House has made suggestions, and many governors have offered theirs. The National Rifle Association has spelled out its proposals.
With the Senate Judiciary Committee scheduled today to hold the first congressional hearings on gun violence since the Newtown tragedy, we offer four general guidelines for a national dialogue on sensible solutions to this deadly malady.
First, any legislation that is suggested should be broad-gauged. There is no one single cause of gun violence and no single solution. That will mean determining if there is any reason for weapons to have magazines that hold 30 rounds or more. It will mean assessing whether armor-piercing bullets -- opposed by police chiefs around the country -- should be legal. And it will mean considering strengthening background checks.
Gun advocates will say that guns don't kill people, people kill people. And of course we must examine the long-term effects on our children of violent movies, television shows and video games. We must address gaps in our mental health system that leave potential killers unidentified and untreated, and this will require more financial resources. And we must strive to make our schools and public gathering places safer, perhaps through federal financing so local police forces can hire additional officers, as was done when the 1994 assault weapons ban was passed.
Second, any approach demands bipartisan support. This is not important just because of our divided government. Absent wide support, any laws passed now might well be rescinded once the partisan balance of power inevitably shifts. A broad-based approach could also help guarantee that any legislation would survive a constitutional challenge. That means that both gun-rights activists and the entertainment industry will have to moderate their positions.
Third, common sense should prevail. We must get away from a mind-set that has owners of firearms worried that ''they are going to take our guns away.'' The Second Amendment guarantees that won't happen. Our nation has regulated various kinds of arms throughout history, and done so without violating the Second Amendment. We have, for example, restricted ownership of fully automatic weapons and grenade launchers.
Finally, each of us should look into our own heart to consider what type of nation we want to be. From members of the National Rifle Association to the most passionate gun-control advocates, no one wants to live in a country where innocent children are killed indiscriminately. This is a problem for all Americans -- not just the government -- and we all must be part of the solution.
That's why we think parents should spend less time leaving their children alone playing shoot-'em-up video games and more time with them doing activities they both enjoy. This includes taking children into the country to hunt and to gain, as we did as boys, a love for the abundance and beauty of nature as well as a respect for the responsible and legitimate use of guns.

Pakistan: Polio Workers Attacked

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; WORLD BRIEFING | ASIA; Pg. 8

LENGTH: 150 words

Gunmen riding a motorcycle shot and killed a police officer protecting polio workers during a United Nations-backed vaccination campaign in northwestern Pakistan on Tuesday, the police said. The attack took place as dozens of polio workers were going door to door to vaccinate children in Gullu Dheri village in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, Officer Izhar Shah said, adding, ''The anti-polio drive in that village has been suspended.'' Some Islamic militants oppose the vaccination campaign, accusing health workers of acting as spies for the United States and claiming that the vaccine is intended to make Muslim children sterile. Pakistan is one of the few remaining places where polio is still rampant. Suspicion of vaccination campaigns has increased since the C.I.A. used a hepatitis vaccination campaign to try to collect blood samples from Osama bin Laden's family in 2011 to confirm his location.

Strict Chicago Gun Laws Can't Stem Fatal Shots

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 1380 words

CHICAGO -- Not a single gun shop can be found in this city because they are outlawed. Handguns were banned in Chicago for decades, too, until 2010, when the United States Supreme Court ruled that was going too far, leading city leaders to settle for restrictions some describe as the closest they could get legally to a ban without a ban. Despite a continuing legal fight, Illinois remains the only state in the nation with no provision to let private citizens carry guns in public.
And yet Chicago, a city with no civilian gun ranges and bans on both assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, finds itself laboring to stem a flood of gun violence that contributed to more than 500 homicides last year and at least 40 killings already in 2013, including a fatal shooting of a 15-year-old girl on Tuesday. 
To gun rights advocates, the city provides stark evidence that even some of the toughest restrictions fail to make places safer. ''The gun laws in Chicago only restrict the law-abiding citizens and they've essentially made the citizens prey,'' said Richard A. Pearson, executive director of the Illinois State Rifle Association. To gun control proponents, the struggles here underscore the opposite -- a need for strict, uniform national gun laws to eliminate the current patchwork of state and local rules that allow guns to flow into this city from outside.
''Chicago is like a house with two parents that may try to have good rules and do what they can, but it's like you've got this single house sitting on a whole block where there's anarchy,'' said the Rev. Ira J. Acree, one among a group of pastors here who have marched and gathered signatures for an end to so much shooting. ''Chicago is an argument for laws that are statewide or, better yet, national.''
Chicago's experience reveals the complications inherent in carrying out local gun laws around the nation. Less restrictive laws in neighboring communities and states not only make guns easy to obtain nearby, but layers of differing laws -- local and state -- make it difficult to police violations. And though many describe the local and state gun laws here as relatively stringent, penalties for violating them -- from jail time to fines -- have not proven as severe as they are in some other places, reducing the incentive to comply.
Lately, the police say they are discovering far more guns on the streets of Chicago than in the nation's two more populous cities, Los Angeles and New York. They seized 7,400 guns here in crimes or unpermitted uses last year (compared with 3,285 in New York City), and have confiscated 574 guns just since Jan. 1 -- 124 of them last week alone.
More than a quarter of the firearms seized on the streets here by the Chicago Police Department over the past five years were bought just outside city limits in Cook County suburbs, according to an analysis by the University of Chicago Crime Lab. Others came from stores around Illinois and from other states, like Indiana, less than an hour's drive away. Since 2008, more than 1,300 of the confiscated guns, the analysis showed, were bought from just one store, Chuck's Gun Shop in Riverdale, Ill., within a few miles of Chicago's city limits.
Efforts to compare the strictness of gun laws and the level of violence across major American cities are fraught with contradiction and complication, not least because of varying degrees of coordination between local and state laws and differing levels of enforcement. In New York City, where homicides and shootings have decreased, the gun laws are generally seen as at least as strict as Chicago's, and the state laws in New York and many of its neighboring states are viewed as still tougher than those in and around Illinois. Philadelphia, like cities in many states, is limited in writing gun measures that go beyond those set by Pennsylvania law. Some city officials there have chafed under what they see as relatively lax state controls.
In Chicago, the rules for owning a handgun -- rewritten after the outright ban was deemed too restrictive in 2010 -- sound arduous. Owners must seek a Chicago firearms permit, which requires firearms training, a background check and a state-mandated firearm owner's identification card, which requires a different background review for felonies and mental illness. To prevent straw buyers from selling or giving their weapons to people who would not meet the restrictions -- girlfriends buying guns for gang members is a common problem, the police here say -- the city requires permitted gun owners to report their weapons lost, sold or stolen.
Still, for all the regulations, the reality here looks different. Some 7,640 people currently hold a firearms permit, but nearly that many illicit weapons were confiscated from the city's streets during last year alone. Chicago officials say Illinois has no requirement, comparable to Chicago's, that gun owners immediately report their lost or stolen weapons to deter straw buyers. Consequently those outside the city can, in the words of one city official, carry guns to gang members in the city with ''zero accountability.''
And a relatively common sentence in state court for gun possession for offenders without other felonies is one year in prison, which really may mean a penalty of six months, said Anita Alvarez, the Cook County state's attorney, who said such punishments failed to serve as a significant enough deterrent for seasoned criminals who may see a modest prison stint as the price of doing business.
''The way the laws are structured facilitates the flow of those guns to hit our streets,'' Garry F. McCarthy, the Chicago police superintendent, said in an interview, later adding, ''Chicago may have comprehensive gun laws, but they are not strict because the sanctions don't exist.''
In the weeks since the mass shooting in Newtown, Conn., Toni Preckwinkle, the Cook County Board president, has introduced a countywide provision requiring gun owners beyond the city limits to report lost or stolen guns, though a first offense would result simply in a $1,000 fine. In the city, Mayor Rahm Emanuel has pressed for increased penalties for those who violate the city's gun ordinance by failing to report their guns missing or possessing an assault weapon.
''Our gun strategy is only as strong as it is comprehensive, and it is constantly being undermined by events and occurrences happening outside the city -- gun shows in surrounding counties, weak gun laws in neighboring states like Indiana and the inability to track purchasing,'' Mr. Emanuel said. ''This must change.''
State lawmakers, too, are soon expected to weigh new state provisions like an assault weapons ban, as Chicago already has. But the fate of the proposals is uncertain in a state with wide-open farming and hunting territory downstate.
''It's going to be a fight,'' said State Representative Jack D. Franks, a Democrat from Marengo, 60 miles outside Chicago. Complicating matters, an appellate court in December struck down the state's ban on carrying guns in public, saying that a complete ban on concealed carry is unconstitutional. Illinois is seeking a review of the ruling, even as state lawmakers have been given a matter of months to contemplate conditions under which guns could be allowed in public.
Many here say that even the strictest, most punitive gun laws would not alone be an answer to this city's violence. ''Poverty, race, guns and drugs -- you've got to deal with all these issues, but you've got to start somewhere'' said the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, who was arrested in 2007 while protesting outside Chuck's Gun Shop, the suburban store long known as a supplier of weapons that make their way to Chicago.
At the store, a clerk said the business followed all pertinent federal, state and local laws, then declined to be interviewed further. Among seized guns that had moved from purchase to the streets of Chicago in a year's time or less, nearly 20 percent came from Chuck's, the analysis found. Other guns arrived here that rapidly from gun shops in other parts of this state, Indiana, Wisconsin, Kentucky, Mississippi, Georgia, Iowa and more.
''Chicago is not an island,'' said David Spielfogel, senior adviser to Mr. Emanuel. ''We're only as strong as the weakest gun law in surrounding states.''

For Republicans, a Push From Voters on Immigration and a Tug on Gun Control

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER; Kitty Bennett contributed research.

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 17

LENGTH: 928 words

WASHINGTON -- As Congress and the White House prepare to refight two epic policy battles from the past -- a new agenda to stem gun violence and another to address the nation's heavily criticized immigration system -- political, demographic and economic shifts are propelling immigration changes forward as forcefully as they are pulling lawmakers away on guns.
Bruised by successive presidential defeats in which Hispanic voters played a significant role, Republicans are eager to join in producing legislation that would make it easier for people to immigrate to the United States or stay here in some cases if they entered illegally. The cause has been helped by years of a sputtering economy, which has reduced the flow of illegal immigrants, and thus the red hot anger directed at them, as well as increased border security. 
But while Republicans are drawing back from their outspoken stance on immigration, as well as opposition to gay marriage and other social issues, they have found gun rights a secure policy to defend, often with the help of Democrats from conservative states, and are almost certain to oppose any agenda beyond changes to background checks for gun owners.
The dynamic in Washington mirrors the sentiment back home for many lawmakers. ''We are getting closer to a balanced approach,'' said Chad Connelly, chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party, about immigration. ''We got spanked in November, and I think what Republicans are looking for is something that enforces border security while making it easier to come here.''
Changes to gun laws, he said, have no such support. ''They will have a rough row to hoe,'' he said. ''I have some donors who own gun stores who said they can't keep stuff in the store.''
One of the most significant changes between 1994, when the omnibus crime bill instituting an assault weapons ban passed, and now, is the number of competitive House seats; there were more than 160 back then, now there are fewer than 100.
This means that Republicans in politically mixed districts who feel the pressure to vote for new gun control measures ''are fewer and farther between than there have ever been,'' said David Wasserman of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. Democrats in Republican districts -- there are about a dozen of them -- would also be disinclined toward such legislation.
Further, there are Senate Democrats up for re-election in 2014 who are loath to get behind the president's broad gun agenda, which includes a renewal of the assault weapons ban, a restriction on ammunition size and new background checks. ''I am a strong supporter of Second Amendment rights,'' said Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, who said she is hearing both sides of the issue back home. ''Over all, the state is probably more supportive of less restrictions than more.''
Tellingly, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, said on Monday that he was ''committed to ensuring that the Senate will consider legislation that addresses gun violence and other aspects of violence in our society early this year,'' but added that when it came to President Obama's immigration agenda, he would ''work tirelessly to make reform a reality in the Senate.''
In 1994, a group of House Republicans banded together to support a broad crime act that included an assault weapons ban. Part of the bill included tough crime measures that appealed to some of them, but it was still an enormous lift; in the end 46 Republicans supported the measure while 131 opposed it.
''I jumped off the cliff with Jon Kyl, who was running for the Senate that year,'' said former Representative Jim Kolbe of Arizona, referring to his colleague, the former conservative House member and senator from Arizona. The two flew to Tucson, where they faced angry voters at a public meeting, Mr. Kolbe said.
''We explained why we did it, why we thought it was a reasonable trade but a lot of people were very unhappy,'' Mr. Kolbe said. He noted that the National Rifle Association remained supportive -- an unlikely outcome today.
On the flip side, Republicans, who were deeply divided just two years ago on immigration issues now largely believe their party needs to be behind some legislation. Senator John McCain of Arizona, who made tough border enforcement the cornerstone of his 2010 re-election campaign, stood with Democrats this week to nearly reverse his position once again on the issue, saying he would seek a bipartisan plan.
''Necessity is the mother of political invention,'' said Bill Whalen, a fellow at the Hoover Institution. ''Republicans are looking at a third straight presidential defeat if they don't improve their image with Hispanic voters.'' He added, ''You don't have a lot of Republicans walking around town saying he lost an election because of our bad relationship with the gun control lobby.''
A gun bill that is limited to background checks, however, still remains a strong possibility in Congress this year, if the Republican leadership of the House would bring such a measure on the floor. ''I was a co-sponsor of a conceal carry bill in Nebraska that had a significant background check component,'' said Senator Deb Fischer, a newly elected Republican from Nebraska.
Such a measure, many gun experts say, may actually do the most to stem gun violence, because it would help keep weapons out of the hands of the mentally ill and criminals. ''We might be in a happy place where effectiveness conforms with political feasibility,'' said Jon S. Vernick, the co-director of Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research.

Chaos in Egypt Stirs Warning Of a Collapse

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK; Kareem Fahim and Mayy El Sheikh contributed reporting from Cairo.

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 1327 words

CAIRO -- As three Egyptian cities defied President Mohamed Morsi's attempt to quell the anarchy spreading through their streets, the nation's top general warned Tuesday that the state itself was in danger of collapse if the feuding civilian leaders could not agree on a solution to restore order.
Thousands of residents poured into the streets of the three cities, protesting a 9 p.m. curfew with another night of chants against Mr. Morsi and assaults on the police.
The president appeared powerless to stop them: he had already granted the police extralegal powers to enforce the curfew and then called out the army as well. His allies in the Muslim Brotherhood and their opposition also proved ineffectual in the face of the crisis, each retreating to their corners, pointing fingers of blame. 
The general's warning punctuated a rash of violent protests across the country that has dramatized the near-collapse of the government's authority. With the city of Port Said proclaiming its nominal independence, protesters demanded the resignation of Mr. Morsi, Egypt's first freely elected president, while people across the country appeared convinced that taking to the streets in protests was the only means to get redress for their grievances.
Just five months after Egypt's president assumed power from the military, the cascading crisis revealed the depth of the distrust for the central government left by decades of autocracy, two years of convoluted transition and his own acknowledged missteps in facing the opposition. With cities in open rebellion and the police unable to tame crowds, the very fabric of society appears to be coming undone.
The chaos has also for the first time touched pillars of the long-term health of Egypt's economy, already teetering after two years of turbulence since the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak. While a heavy deployment of military troops along the Suez Canal -- a vital source of revenue -- appeared to insulate it from the strife in Port Said, Suez and Ismailia, the clashes near Tahrir Square in Cairo spilled over for the first time into an armed assault on the historic Semiramis InterContinental Hotel, sending tremors of fear through the vital tourism sector.
With the stakes rising and no solution in sight, Gen. Abdul Fattah el-Sisi, the defense minister, warned Egypt's new Islamist leaders and their opponents that ''their disagreement on running the affairs of the country may lead to the collapse of the state and threatens the future of the coming generations.''
''Political, economic, social and security challenges'' require united action ''by all parties'' to avoid ''dire consequences that affect the steadiness and stability of the homeland,'' General Sisi said in an address to military cadets that was later relayed as a public statement from his spokesman. And the acute polarization of the civilian politics, he suggested, has now becoming a concern of the military because ''to affect the stability of the state institutions is a dangerous matter that harms Egyptian national security.''
Coming just months after the military relinquished the power it seized at the ouster of Mr. Mubarak, General Sisi's rebuke to the civilian leaders inevitably raised the possibility that the generals might once again step into civilian politics. There was no indication of an imminent coup.
Analysts familiar with General Sisi's thinking say that unlike his predecessors, he wants to avoid any political entanglements. But the Egyptian military has prided itself on its dual military and political role since Col. Gamal Abdel Nasser's coup more than six decades ago. And General Sisi insisted Tuesday that it would remain ''the solid mass and the backbone upon which rest the Egyptian state's pillars.''
With the army now caught between the president's instructions to restore order and the citizens' refusal to comply, he said, the ''armed forces are facing a serious dilemma'' as they seek to end the violence without ''confronting citizens and their right to protest.''
The attack on the Semiramis Hotel, between the American Embassy and the Nile in one of the most heavily guarded neighborhoods of the city, showed how much security had deteriorated. And it testified to the difficult task that the civilian government faces in trying to rebuild public security and trust.
Capitalizing on the melee between protesters and the police outside the hotel after about 2 a.m., at least a dozen armed men overpowered the guard at the hotel's door, looted the luxury stores in its mall and ransacked its lobby, hotel staff members said. The assailants carried knives, pellet guns and one semiautomatic weapon, a guard told Al Ahram Online, run by the state-owned news media.
When the police failed to respond to calls for help, the hotel staff resorted to Twitter, the favorite medium of the Egyptian revolt. ''We are under attack! Several thugs have entered the Semiramis! Send help!'' the hotel's Twitter account blared in capital letters.
''Revolutionaries'' from the protest outside helped drive out the attackers, said Nabila Samak, the marketing manager who sent out the messages. The police finally responded about an hour and a half after the attack began, she said. The guests were relocated and the hotel closed.
Instead of taking a united stand in support of the law, Egypt's political elite bickered over who was to blame. On Monday, the main coalition of the opposition refused to join a committee Mr. Morsi has created with the promise that it would include opponents to review the government's measures to stem the chaos and to propose amendments to the Islamist-backed Constitution.
The president must ''publicly admit his political responsibility for the Egyptian blood that was shed,'' Hamdeen Sabahi, a leftist former presidential candidate, demanded at a news conference.
Mr. Morsi's allies in the Muslim Brotherhood, meanwhile, charged that the opposition leaders were looking for ''political cover to justify the ongoing violent crimes their members are committing, including attempted murder, arson, burglary, sabotage and vandalism,'' as Ahmed Diab, a leader of the Brotherhood's political party, said in a statement on Monday. ''But they cannot so fast wash their hands of the blood of Egyptians they shed in one way or another.''
In a news conference on Tuesday, Mr. Morsi's spokesman echoed the Brotherhood's charges by pointedly demanding that the opposition ''clearly condemn violence, repudiate it and urge against taking part in it.''
Talaat Abdullah, the public prosecutor Mr. Morsi recently appointed, went a step further, issuing warrants for the arrests of a spectral new activist group calling itself the Black Bloc, which Brotherhood leaders have begun calling the opposition's ''militia.''
The group's only confirmed act is its debut in an online video posted just a week ago depicting a group of masked figures. Declaring themselves part of a worldwide ''liberation'' movement, they said they intended to counter the Muslim Brotherhood, which it called ''the regime of fascist tyranny.''
Since then, rumors have swirled about masked figures in protests and clashes who may or may not be members of the Black Bloc. Masked men purporting to belong to the group have given interviews denouncing the Brotherhood. But in a second video posted on Monday by the same source the Black Bloc disavowed them. In a bizarre twist, the video charged that the supposed spokesmen were in fact from the Muslim Brotherhood, seeking to blame the group for unrest.
Without any public evidence that the group has done more than pose for a video, the state news service reported Tuesday that an investigation by the prosecutor had found the Black Bloc a terrorist group. What is more, the news service reported, prosecutors ordered the arrest of not only its members but also of anyone who would ''participate in it in any form including wearing the costumes'' -- outlawing, in effect, the wearing of a black mask.

Chinese Courts Turn a Blind Eye to Abuse

BYLINE: By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW

SECTION: Section ; Column 0; Foreign Desk; THE FEMALE FACTOR; Pg. 

LENGTH: 844 words

BEIJING -- Before they married in 2009, Tan Yong admitted to Li Yan that he had beaten his three previous wives. He promised to change.
The promises didn't last, said Li Dehuai, Ms. Li's brother. Soon after the wedding, Mr. Tan began abusing his wife.
''He stubbed out cigarettes on her face and legs. He would take her hair and hit her head against the wall. He locked her on the balcony for hours in the winter,'' said Mr. Li, speaking by telephone from Chongqing in southwestern China. The abuse went on for more than a year. 
Today, Mr. Tan is dead, beaten to death by Ms. Li with the barrel of his air gun during an argument in November 2010, and Mr. Li is trying to save his sister's life as she sits in a jail in Sichuan Province awaiting execution for murder. The case has caused an outcry among Chinese legal experts and feminists, who say it underscores the severe sentences often imposed on women who fight back, injuring or killing abusive husbands.
''Li Yan's case tells people that extreme tragedy will happen if an abused woman cannot get effective help from the neighborhood committee, the women's federation, the police,'' said Feng Yuan, of the Anti-Domestic Violence Network, based in Beijing.
''When power cannot deliver justice, abused women will find their own way of achieving justice, sadly and wrongly,'' Ms. Feng said.
Chinese law requires that a history of domestic abuse be considered in such cases. Ms. Li's was especially gruesome: After killing her husband (which she confessed to early, asking a neighbor to call the police), she cut him up and boiled some of the parts. If that is hard to excuse, consider this, said Ms. Feng: She wasn't in her right mind.
''There's something called abused women's syndrome, and she had it. A woman like that may lose her reason and lose control,'' said Ms. Feng, one of hundreds of people petitioning the courts to retry Ms. Li, this time taking the abuse into proper consideration. This was not done the first time, making Ms. Li's case a miscarriage of justice, they say.
Others who have joined the appeal include lawyers, deputies to the National People's Congress and Amnesty International, which last week issued an urgent action call for the Chinese authorities not to execute Ms. Li. The sentence could be carried out any day now, activists say, probably before the Lunar New Year's Eve on Feb. 9.
Women's jails are filled with women who have injured or killed abusive husbands, according to the Anti-Domestic Violence Network, citing studies by local women's federations and scholars. They account for 60 percent of inmates in one jail in Anshan, in Liaoning Province, and 80 percent of women serving heavy sentences in a jail in Fuzhou, in Fujian Province.
In a study by Xing Hongmei of China Women's University, of 121 female inmates in a Sichuan jail who were serving time for attacking or killing abusive partners, 71 were originally sentenced to life in prison or to death (sometimes commuted, delayed or overturned on appeal), and 28 more were sentenced to at least 10 years. This means more than 80 percent received the heaviest possible sentences for murder or bodily harm, the study said.
For months before she killed Mr. Tan, Ms. Li sought help from the authorities in Anyue County, in Sichuan Province, where they lived, her brother said.
''She telephoned the police in, I think, May 2010, after a beating, but they said it was an affair between married people and hung up,'' he said.
She went to her neighborhood committee. ''They told her to go to the women's association. The women's association told her to go to the police. The police told her to go to the neighborhood committee,'' and so it continued, he said. ''She was sent from place to place and didn't know what to do.''
Officials at the local justice department whom she asked about divorce told her that unless Mr. Tan agreed, she could be left destitute. She was better off tolerating the abuse, they advised.
There was some documentation of the abuse, including police photographs of injuries and a medical report after hospital treatment, said Mr. Li. But both the Sichuan court that sentenced her and the Supreme Court in Beijing, which reviews all death sentences -- Mr. Li and activists say it upheld his sister's sentence last week -- failed to take this into account when sentencing her, Mr. Li said.
''We all hoped the court would recognize the torture she'd suffered in those years,'' he said. ''But it didn't.''
''I know what my sister did was wrong, but since this happened, I have studied many cases of domestic abuse, and I know her situation is not uncommon,'' he said.
He has not yet been able to tell their mother, or Ms. Li's 18-year-old daughter from a previous marriage, that Ms. Li faces imminent execution.
''I think my niece knows, somehow,'' he said. ''But my mother couldn't take it.''
Their father, who died last year, had worked in the same silk factory as Ms. Li and Mr. Tan, and had disliked the man from the start, Mr. Li said.
''He was so depressed at her situation,'' he said. ''I think he died of grief.''

Gun Rights Backers, Stung by Cuomo's Law, Push to Undo It

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 22

LENGTH: 1189 words

ALBANY -- More than 100,000 people have signed online petitions denouncing New York's recently enacted gun laws. Gun owners are contemplating civil disobedience, vowing to ignore a requirement to register firearms they own that are now classified as assault weapons. And some are even calling for the impeachment of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo.
Gun rights advocates, stunned and stung by the swift passage of some of the toughest gun laws in the country, are trying to channel their anger into action. Fueled by social media, and encouraged by gun owners in more conservative states, they are pushing for the repeal of New York's law. And they are preparing to go to court; the New York State Rifle and Pistol Association filed a notice on Tuesday that it planned to ask a judge to overturn the law on constitutional grounds.
They face long odds in a state where the public and elected officials seem to have reached a consensus in favor of more restrictive gun laws. But just as Mr. Cuomo vowed that New York would provide a model for other states in response to the school massacre in Newtown, Conn., gun owners were promising to set an example in fighting back. 
''The more people see about this, the angrier they are getting,'' said Jacob J. Rieper, the vice president of legislative and political affairs for the Rifle and Pistol Association. He recounted sympathetic phone calls from as far away as Nebraska, where a man pledged to collect donations at his gun club to support a legal challenge to the law, and angry messages from New York gun owners who were eager to campaign against the legislators who voted for the measure.
''The bottom line is none of these people thought this through, and it's starting to stink,'' Mr. Rieper said.
A petition circulated by State Senator Kathleen A. Marchione, a Republican from Saratoga County, that condemns the new gun laws has more than 118,000 signatures. Ms. Marchione, a member of the National Rifle Association, has proposed the repeal of many provisions in the bill, but her effort is mostly symbolic.
''The reality is that the Assembly would never pass it,'' said Dean G. Skelos of Long Island, the Senate Republican leader, ''the governor would never pass it, so I think we move on now to other issues.''
Thousands of gun owners gathered for a rally at the Capitol the weekend after the bill was enacted, on Jan. 15, while others assembled in Buffalo, where the Republican nominee for governor in 2010, Carl P. Paladino, denounced Mr. Cuomo and the ''gutless, cowardly legislators'' who supported his legislation.
And thousands of people have signed petitions seeking the impeachment of Mr. Cuomo -- again, not a likely outcome, given that he enjoys broad legislative support.
Frank Riess, a real estate appraiser and firearms dealer from the Hudson Valley, was so upset that he bought the domain name ImpeachAndrewCuomo.com the morning after the State Senate approved the laws. Mr. Riess acknowledged that Mr. Cuomo had not done anything that would provide a legal rationale for impeachment, but said he still hoped the governor would take notice of his petition, which now has more than 19,000 signatures.
''We were just trying to make a statement, to show other firearm enthusiasts that you're not alone in your frustration,'' he said.
Mr. Cuomo and his allies are not looking back. More than 7 in 10 voters across the state supported an expanded ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines in a Siena College poll conducted after the governor proposed the measures.
''It's very important not to mistake the noise that the other side is good at creating for expressing the sentiment of the people,'' said Richard M. Aborn, the president of the Citizens Crime Commission of New York City. ''It does not. It does not even express the sentiment of gun owners. It's noise based on fear, and I think the governor was quite right to say we're going to do this. He got it done with lightning speed and crystal clarity, and now we move on.''
Still, Mr. Cuomo was concerned enough about the outcry that his office urged gun control groups to rally their supporters on his behalf. One group, New Yorkers Against Gun Violence, started a counter-petition so residents could thank the governor and lawmakers for their action, and the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence e-mailed its supporters to praise the new law and also sent a letter of commendation to legislative leaders.
Many gun rights organizations believe their best chance at overturning all or part of the new law is through litigation.
''Much of what the governor has gotten in New York is liable to fall because of court challenges and the like because much of it's unconstitutional,'' the N.R.A. president, David Keene, said in a recent interview on an Albany radio station.
James D. Tresmond, a lawyer in western New York who spends most of his time handling criminal defense cases, filed a lawsuit challenging the law on Tuesday on behalf of two local gun owners in State Supreme Court in Buffalo. He said he hoped it would become a class-action lawsuit: with the publicity the suit has generated on Facebook, he said, he has been contacted by more than 14,000 potential plaintiffs in the past two weeks.
''They want to contribute money,'' Mr. Tresmond said. ''They want to get rid of this governor. They want to get rid of the legislators that voted for it.''
''I think this legislation,'' he added, ''just falls off the edge of the earth with regard to the constitutional rights of the people that are involved.''
Supporters of the gun law are also facing criticism from some law enforcement officials. While district attorneys and police chiefs have praised the measure, the New York State Sheriffs' Association has criticized a number of provisions in the law and also objected to what it described as the Legislature's ''steamroller approach to important legislation.''
In Schuyler County, the sheriff, William E. Yessman Jr., posted on Facebook to reassure residents that no one from his office ''will be coming to take your firearms from you.'' In Chemung County, the sheriff, Christopher J. Moss, who said his office had received hundreds of phone calls from worried gun owners, scheduled two information sessions this week about the new law.
''I'm sure it will be a venting process as well because people are very upset,'' he said.
One issue that law enforcement officials are preparing to confront is possible civil disobedience. The gun control bill requires people who currently own assault weapons to register them with the state by April 15, 2014.
''I don't think I've talked to a person yet who's said they're registering,'' said George W. Rogero, a handgun safety instructor from Orange County who operates a Web site about gun rights. Mr. Rogero said he believed the registration provision for assault weapons would be followed by an effort by the state to confiscate guns.
''They're not going to stop until we don't have any right to have a firearm, and just to heck with the Second Amendment,'' Mr. Rogero said. ''It doesn't mean anything to them. They don't like it, they don't want it and they just want to ignore it.''

Tools of Modern Gunmaking: Plastic and a 3-D Printer

BYLINE: By HENRY FOUNTAIN

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 12

LENGTH: 1214 words

A man in Wisconsin viewed it as a technical challenge. Another, in New Hampshire, was looking to save some money. And in Texas, a third wanted to make a political point.
The three may have had different motivations but their results were the same: each built a working gun that included a part made in plastic with a 3-D printer.
What they did was legal and, except for the technology and material used, not much different from what do-it-yourself gunsmiths have been doing for decades. But in the wake of the shootings in Newtown, Conn., and the intensified debate over gun control, their efforts, which began last summer, have stoked concerns that the inexpensive and increasingly popular printers and other digital fabrication tools might make access to weapons even easier.
''We now have 3-D printers that can manufacture firearms components in the basement,'' said Representative Steve Israel, Democrat of New York. ''It's just a matter of time before a 3-D printer will produce a weapon capable of firing bullets.'' 
A 3-D printer builds an object layer by layer in three dimensions, usually in plastic. To effectively outlaw weapons made with them, Mr. Israel wants to extend an existing law, set to expire this year, that makes weapons that are undetectable by security scanners -- like a printed all-plastic gun -- illegal.
But there are also major technical obstacles to creating an entire gun on a 3-D printer, not the least of which is that a plastic gun would probably melt or explode upon firing a single bullet, making it about as likely to kill the gunman as the target.
In the meantime, Michael Guslick in Milwaukee, Chapman Baetzel in Dover, N.H., and Cody Wilson in Austin, Tex., did something much simpler and, for now, more effective. They printed the part of an AR-15 assault rifle called the lower receiver, the central piece that other parts are attached to. Then, using standard metal components, including the chamber and barrel -- the parts that must be strong enough to withstand the intense pressure of a bullet firing -- they assembled working guns.
In all, the three men, who have written about their efforts on the Web, have fired hundreds of rounds, although the plastic receivers eventually deform, crack or otherwise fail from heat and shock. But Mr. Wilson, for one, is working on a fourth-generation design that he says should be more durable.
A lower receiver is the only part of an AR-15 that, when bought, requires the filing of federal paperwork. But it is legal to make an AR-15 -- and many other guns -- for personal use as long as there is no intent to sell them. And if the lower receiver is homemade, no paperwork is required.
Amateur gunsmiths have made lower receivers for years, in metal, although the process requires a certain level of machining expertise. Inexpensive 3-D printers have grown in popularity -- their rise has been compared with that of personal computers in the 1980s -- in part because they are easy to use. It is not even necessary to know how to create the design files that instruct the device to print bit after bit of plastic to build the object, as there are files for tens of thousands of objects available on the Internet, created by other users and freely shared.
Still, some tinkering is usually required. Mr. Guslick, who works in information technology and describes himself as a hobbyist gunsmith, printed his receiver on a machine he bought online through Craigslist. He used a file and abrasive paper to make the piece fit properly, but over all the project was not much of a technical challenge. ''Anybody could do this,'' he said.
Mr. Baetzel, who made his receiver on a 3-D printer he built from a kit, said the part worked fine until he cracked it when bumping the gun while putting it in his car. He has since printed a replacement along with a modified grip and stock which, he said, has made the gun sturdier.
For Mr. Baetzel, who works as a software tester, the motivation for printing gun parts was economic. ''Shooting is an expensive sport,'' he said. He figured he could save perhaps $40 by making the receiver rather than buying one.
Only Mr. Wilson, a law student who prints his receivers on friends' machines, had overtly political motives, wanting to demonstrate what he called the absurdity of gun-control laws. He took his efforts even further, printing high-capacity magazines like those that would be banned under recommendations proposed by President Obama and successfully testing them this month on a firing range south of Austin. He has posted the drawing files at his Web site, defcad.org, so that others can print the magazine.
''It's unbannable,'' he said. ''The Internet has it now.''
Mr. Wilson also has a project to develop a fully printable one-shot weapon, although he has not made much progress. He is seeking a firearms manufacturer's license, which he would need to even make prototypes of a complete weapon.
He gets advice and technical help from a network of about 15 collaborators around the world, and has posted other printer files at his site, including Mr. Guslick's file for a lower receiver.
Mr. Baetzel posted his files on his own blog, Ambulatory Armament Depot, after a printer file-sharing site, Thingiverse, forced him to remove them in December. A spokeswoman for MakerBot, a 3-D printer manufacturer that sponsors Thingiverse, pointed out that the site's terms of service prohibit content that ''contributes to the creation of weapons.''
Mr. Guslick, who is currently machining a few metal lower receivers, said 3-D printers were far from the best tool for gun-making, an opinion shared by Neil Gershenfeld, a professor at M.I.T. and director of the school's Center for Bits and Atoms.
''A well-equipped machine shop for a long time has been able to make gun parts,'' Mr. Gershenfeld said. ''Three-D printers make not very good ones.''
The types of computer-controlled tools found in a machine shop -- primarily laser cutters and milling machines -- are expensive. But smaller and cheaper versions are now available to dedicated hobbyists, though they do not yet have quite the mass appeal of 3-D printers.
Yet the printers have other drawbacks besides the use of plastic. They are slow, often taking hours to build an object, and the results, while impressive to the eye, can be too crude for extremely close-fitting parts.
And as Mr. Guslick pointed out, anyone who is desperate for a weapon ''has the ability to assemble a zip gun from parts bought in a hardware store for $15.''
The National Rifle Association did not respond to messages requesting the group's position on 3-D manufacturing. But for gun-control advocates, the real worry regarding 3-D printers and other machines is what the future might bring in the way of technological advances.
''Down the road it's going to be a big concern,'' said Josh Horwitz, executive director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. ''We don't know how that's going to come about and don't know what technology.''

He said he did not post his designs hoping that someone would use them illegally. ''It was more, 'Look at this cool thing I did.' ''

Adversaries in Syria Trade Blame for Scores of Killings in Aleppo

BEIRUT, Lebanon -- Scores of muddied and waterlogged gunshot victims, most of them men in their 20s and 30s, were found dead in a suburb of Syria's contested northern city of Aleppo on Tuesday. Insurgents and the government accused one another of carrying out the killings in what appeared to be the latest civil war atrocity.
Videos posted by opponents of President Bashar al-Assad seemed to show that many had been shot in the back of the head while their hands were bound. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an activist organization based in Britain with a network of contacts in Syria, said at least 50 bodies had been located, scattered along the banks of a small river in the Bustan al-Qasr neighborhood, which is mostly under rebel control. Later reports put the tally much higher. 
Al Jazeera quoted a commander from the insurgent Free Syrian Army, identified as Capt. Abu Sada, as saying that there could be more than 100 bodies, with many still submerged in the murky river, and that all had been ''executed by the regime.''
Syria's state news agency, SANA, later posted a report on its Web site that blamed the insurgent Islamist fighters of Al Nusra Front, and said the killings added to ''a series of brutal massacres perpetrated by the terrorist groups against unarmed civilians.''
The videos emerged as the United Nations reported a sharp increase in the number of refugees known officially to have fled Syria, increasing the total in neighboring countries to more than 700,000 from 500,000 in December.
At the same time, rebel fighters seeking Mr. Assad's overthrow appeared to have made advances in the east of the country, raiding a security office in the city of Deir al-Zour, where government forces have seemed to reduce their presence to concentrate on the center, giving rebels more freedom to maneuver and in some cases siphon fuel from gas and oil fields there.
Activists said the insurgents in Deir al-Zour included Nusra Front members, who are considered highly effective fighters, although the United States regards the group as a terrorist organization. The rebels freed 11 detainees and captured a tank and three armed personnel carriers, according to the Local Coordination Committees, an anti-Assad activist network in Syria.
The Syrian conflict began in March 2011 as a peaceful protest, but has since spiraled into civil war.
In Geneva, one agency, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, reported an ''unrelenting flow of refugees'' across Syria's borders, principally into Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq and Turkey.
The highest numbers were in Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon, but smaller numbers had been registered in Egypt and North Africa, said Sybella Wilkes, a spokeswoman for the refugee agency.
The fighting has long ceased to be a straight contest between government and rebel forces. In the northern town of Ras al-Ain on the border with Turkey, rebels have fought Kurds. In Deir al-Zour, rivalries among the groups claiming to have overrun the security office showed the contest between them to attract arms and recruits.
Omar Abu Layla, an activist documenting the fighting, said local and Nusra groups had joined in the fighting.
''Al Nusra are good in suicide attacks, but our battalions are better than them at storming,'' he said.
In the central city of Homs, meanwhile, the toll of the fighting among the dwindling number of inhabitants seemed evident on Tuesday as government forces launched a rocket attack on the Jouret al-Shiyah neighborhood.
Um Abdo, a resident in her 50s, said: ''Mercy, dear God, mercy. I don't know what's going on. I feel that they're shelling right above us. I feel that the whole world is shaking. The shelling is so heavy and so close. Pray for us please. I swear we are drained and exhausted.''
Violence also flared on Tuesday in central Damascus, where a car bomb exploded and severely injured a member of Parliament, Abed al-Razaq Katan, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported. State news media did not immediately report the explosion.
In Washington, President Obama announced that the United States would donate a further $155 million to aid Syrian refugees, bringing the total pledged by the country as humanitarian aid to $365 million. But that is a fraction of the $1.5 billion that the United Nations says is needed over the next six months as it issues urgent appeals for more international funding.
At the United Nations, Lakhdar Brahimi, the joint United Nations and Arab League envoy trying to mediate a settlement, gave the Security Council a pessimistic assessment. Echoing the themes of his last briefing in November, Mr. Brahimi said it was time for the Council to act in such a way that removes any ambiguity about its wish for a political, not a military, solution.
In Geneva last June, the major powers agreed that Syria should be governed by a transitional government, but they never defined its powers. To the United States, it meant President Assad should resign. But Russia, Syria's main international ally, maintains that the Syrians must decide.
The wording in the Geneva accord was ''creative, clever ambiguity,'' Mr. Brahimi told reporters, saying it was time for the Security Council ''to say what these full executive powers mean.''
With the Council deadlocked, Syria grows as a threat to the whole region, which should spur the Council to action, Mr. Brahimi said. ''Syria is being destroyed bit by bit, and by destroying Syria the region is being pushed into a situation that is extremely bad for the entire world,'' he said.
On Tuesday night, Russia was hosting a dinner for Mr. Brahimi with the ambassadors from the five permanent members of the Security Council, but there seemed to be little hope for a breakthrough. Russia and China have together vetoed three Council resolutions focused on Syria since the conflict erupted.
''The same issues that have stymied the Council to date remain unresolved, so there is no obvious way forward,'' said Susan E. Rice, the American ambassador to the United Nations.

9 P.M. (13, 49) WHO KILLED LINDBERGH'S BABY? On March 1, 1932, Charles and Anne Lindbergh's 20-month-old son, above, was kidnapped from the family's home near Hopewell, N.J. Negotiations stretched out for weeks, but the boy was never returned. His body was found two months later less than five miles from Hopewell, and, after a two-year investigation, Bruno Richard Hauptmann, a German immigrant living in the Bronx, was ultimately found guilty of extortion and murder. He was executed on April 3, 1936. This ''Nova'' episode reopens the case as investigators use contemporary forensic and behavioral-science techniques to determine what really happened to the child, and why.
9 A.M. (CUNY) LIVING FOR 32 (2010) ''City Talk'' presents this documentary, directed by Kevin Breslin and produced by Maria Cuomo Cole, about Colin Goddard, a survivor of the 2007 Virginia Tech massacre, and his work with the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. Afterward Doug Muzzio moderates a discussion with Jeremy Travis, the president of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice at the City University of New York. 
11 A.M. (USA) THE GOLDEN COMPASS (2007) There's an entire bestiary at the heart of this fantasy, based on a novel by Philip Pullman, about Lyra (Dakota Blue Richards, below), an orphan in a parallel universe who sets out on a quest to save her best friend from undergoing horrible experiments at a mysterious institution. Nicole Kidman glides across the screen like liquid gold in the role of Mrs. Coulter, whose expressionless beauty masks her evil designs. Writing in The New York Times, Manohla Dargis called this film, directed by Chris Weitz, ''an honorable work'' that was ''hampered by its fealty to the book and its madly rushed pace, which forces you to dash through the story like Lord Asriel'' (Lyra's uncle, an explorer, played by Daniel Craig).
3 P.M. (Fox Movie Channel) BABY MAMA (2008) Kate (Tina Fey) is a career woman who decides to have a baby with a surrogate, the decidedly free-spirited Angie (Amy Poehler), in this comedy directed by Michael McCullers. ''Much like the prickly, talented Ms. Fey,'' the film ''pulls you in with a provocative and, at least in current American movies, unusual mix of female intelligence, awkwardness and chilled-to-the-bone mean,'' Manohla Dargis wrote in The Times.

Viggo Mortensen portrays Emily's lover, whom Steven offers $500,000 to do the deed or be exposed for the con man and gigolo he really is. ''The creepiest aspect of 'A Perfect Murder' is that there really is no contest between love and money,'' Stephen Holden wrote in The Times. ''The movie is right in tune with the icy Darwinian mood fostered by the booming late-'90s economy.'' KATHRYN SHATTUCK

Congress Takes Up Gun Violence

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; EDITORIAL; Pg. 26

LENGTH: 662 words

Senate hearings on stronger gun controls are scheduled to begin on Wednesday before a divided Congress and a nation agonizing over how to prevent more of the carnage that killed 20 schoolchildren and six adults last month at a Newtown, Conn., elementary school. The gun lobby's opposition to reasonable controls is already fierce, and political courage is, as ever, wavering in Congress. But this singular opportunity to curb the gun violence must not be wasted in more of the posturing in Washington that tolerates 30,000 gun deaths a year.
The Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to hear a raft of proposals, including a vitally needed ban on fast-firing semiautomatic weapons, like the military-style Bushmaster assault rifle the Newtown gunman used in his killing spree at Sandy Hook Elementary School. The measure would also ban ammunition magazines that can hold more than 10 bullets, which have facilitated battlefield-scale killing of the innocent in the Newtown school, the movie theater in Aurora, Colo., and dozens of similar tragedies. 
Making federal background checks universal, instead of limiting them to sales by licensed gun dealers, is no less vital, closing a loophole that lets 40 percent of firearm sales take place with no oversight. This proposal is the chief goal of many gun-control groups and has a different aim than the assault weapons ban: the proliferation of handguns that are used in most gun violence, particularly in cities.
Another measure would create a separate criminal offense for gun trafficking and toughen penalties on those involved, including the ''straw buyers'' who purchase weapons later funneled into criminal hands. This should be accompanied by tighter restrictions on high-risk gun dealers who sell a disproportionate number of the guns traced to crimes, as well as new resources for more frequent inspection of all gun stores. Congressional corridors and committee evasions are not the way to advance these bills. They should be debated and voted on in public view so each lawmaker can be tallied on these major issues. The Second Amendment is nowhere at stake.
The fight will not be easy. A bill introduced by Senator Dianne Feinstein of California would, for example, ban 157 of the worst assault weapons while leaving 2,200 guns untouched in the sportsmen's marketplace. ''I understand how difficult this is,'' Ms. Feinstein said. ''That doesn't mean we shouldn't try.''
The reform effort will require an unprecedented outpouring of public support and pressure on Congress -- a national drive that President Obama needs to make unrelenting and well-organized. The sponsor of the assault weapons ban in the House, Representative Carolyn McCarthy of New York, wisely says nothing will come of the reform effort unless the president is ''out there selling it.''
Mr. Obama is supposed to follow Vice President Joseph Biden Jr. in leaving Washington for drumbeating rounds with community leaders. Mr. Biden is already emphasizing his mantra for audiences: ''Tell your congressman.''
Republicans and wobbly Democrats in the House are waiting on results from the Senate, where the Democratic majority leader, Harry Reid, will play a crucial role. He is skeptical of an assault weapons ban and wary of losing Senate Democrats in next year's elections. But he admits, ''We need to accept the reality that we are not doing enough to protect our citizens.''
Mr. Reid aims to have legislation shaped by the Judiciary Committee for floor debate that will be freely open to amendment. This unusual process has the virtue of putting senators on the record for each major proposal, but could weaken a measure as much as strengthen it.
Nothing is settled in Congress. The outcome depends to a great degree on how demanding the public is for credible action against the gun violence ravaging the nation.
This is part of a continuing series on the epidemic of gun violence and possible solutions. Other editorials are at nytimes.com/gunchallenge.

All He Touches Turns to Cashmere

BYLINE: By ERIC WILSON

SECTION: Section E; Column 0; Style Desk; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 1120 words

Greg Chait, the designer of the Elder Statesman, is not someone you would expect to be named the class of 2012's most likely to succeed.
He is laid back in the way that comes from living in Southern California, where he works in a sunny studio in Culver City. His defining feature is a bushy black beard that could easily contain a pair of knitting needles. Ask him how he got his start in fashion, and he replies, ''It was an accident.''
You will not get much further if you ask when Mr. Chait, who is 34, plans to marry his longtime fiancיe, the actress Laura Ramsey, with whom he has a 3-year-old daughter.
''The idea is to do it when it sounds like fun,'' he said. 
Mr. Chait, who is surprisingly direct about his priorities, seems just as perplexed as anyone that his little collection of cashmere sweaters and blankets, founded in 2007, has been such a hit. In November, he won a $300,000 prize and a year of business mentoring from the annual CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund, singled out among a pool of emerging designers, including Andrea Lieberman, Wes Gordon, and Max Osterweis and Erin Beatty of Suno, for his promise.
He makes running a fashion business look too easy, like the time he flew to Paris without any sales appointments and returned a week later with a dozen new retail accounts, including the fancy ones like Colette and L'Eclaireur. Or when some houseguests from Australia left him with a suitcase full of samples of their jeans, and asked him to represent them in the United States. (That collection became Ksubi.) Or even 15 years ago, when Mr. Chait set out to find an internship in the music industry and was hired by Whitney Houston.
But let us step back a moment, for nothing can be as easy as all that.
''I'm not special,'' Mr. Chait said a few weeks after he won the award, aware that he was considered a dark horse in the race. Running a business that specializes in expensive knits requires a lot of attention to details like inventory and deadlines, not to mention the willingness to be seen as a little crafts-y. One of Mr. Chait's most popular designs, based on the Baja pullover, is a hippie classic re-envisioned in cashmere. (With a price of $2,100, it might help to be stoned.)
''With a business like this, you cannot skimp on things, not at all,'' Mr. Chait said. ''Trying to balance not going completely broke with doing things the right way -- that brings a tremendous amount of stress.''
Even as he accepted the award, things were not going entirely according to a plan.
In the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, Mr. Chait was having a hard time completing the production of some 300 pieces that retailers were expecting in time for holiday sales. Though his business is based on the West Coast, many of the orders were for a design collaboration with Audrey Louise Reynolds, a fabric dyer whose work is revered in the fashion industry and who had created a tie-dye and palm-tree motif on sweaters for Mr. Chait. But her studio, in the Red Hook neighborhood of Brooklyn, was flooded and inoperable.
Given that prices in the Elder Statesman collection can cost $800 to $3,000 for sweaters, and $2,000 to $7,000 for blankets, 300 items is a large order. It took flying Ms. Reynolds to Los Angeles and setting up a makeshift studio with friends as volunteers for a week to make the deadline.
Mr. Chait has impressed retailers with both his designs and his intuitiveness. For one thing, he creates different designs for each store, so that globe-trotting customers might be excited to encounter items at Barneys New York, for example, that they hadn't already seen at Maxfield in Los Angeles.
Jeffrey Kalinsky, the director of designer merchandising for Nordstrom and the founder of the Jeffrey boutiques in New York and Atlanta, said he ordered the Elder Statesman collection for his stores for spring after he met Mr. Chait as a judge in the Fashion Fund competition. The work of the 10 finalists will be sold in pop-up boutiques in six Nordstrom stores beginning next month, including the Treasure & Bond store in SoHo on Feb. 6.
''I was blown away by his vision,'' Mr. Kalinsky said. ''This was a question of does the emperor have clothes, or not. This emperor definitely has clothes. There is gorgeous product at all different prices for men and women that is very well thought out and merchandised.''
This was no accident. Since he started the collection, Mr. Chait has been looking for ways to introduce lower prices, and he plans to show more items with retail prices under $800 beginning in his fall collection, using cashmere sourced from Afghanistan.
''Making goods that are expensive has never been my mission,'' he said. ''Making goods with soul has always been my mission.''
Growing up in Paradise Valley, Ariz., a son of a successful surgeon, Mr. Chait was somewhat charmed in his early years. He once dated an Olsen. Even before that, at age 19, thinking he would pursue a career in music, he managed to make a connection to Ms. Houston through a family friend who owned a travel agency specializing in concert tours. That turned out to be a real eye-opener when he accompanied Ms. Houston on tour.
''I remember Adam Sandler at the time was my idol, and we were in the green room at the Los Angeles show, and he's standing next to me, getting a bagel, and I think, What do I say to him?'' Mr. Chait recalled. As he tells the story:
Mr. Chait: ''She's pretty talented, huh?''
Mr. Sandler: ''Ye-ah. It's Whitney Houston.''
This was not as embarrassing as the time when Mr. Chait, while working at the talent agency the Firm, was asked to sit in on a meeting to screen a video of a new artist. ''That's terrible,'' he told the room. ''It's never going to work.'' It was Pink.
He was 24 when his Australian friends left him with the suitcase of jeans and told him to figure it out. He did, showing the collection out of his living room, and helping to build a $20 million business at the height of the craze for skinny jeans. When an investor approached Ksubi (then known as Tsubi) in 2007, Mr. Chait used the proceeds to start his own label. The name Elder Statesman is a tribute to an older brother who died in a Phoenix shooting in 2004.
Though he did not make a profit in the first two years, his business has done well, in part, because his approach is different from that of most designers. His inventory is mostly in pricey yarns, and he produces orders as close to delivery as possible so as not to get stuck with a glut of any given style. He also designs interiors and has a healthy trade in blankets, particularly among wealthy clients who are looking to outfit a private jet or a screening room. ''You would be surprised how many people have a need for 20 or 30 blankets at a time,'' he said.

E.M.T. Convicted of 5 Sexual Assaults

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 20

LENGTH: 192 words

An emergency medical technician with the Fire Department was convicted on Wednesday of a series of sexual assaults in Brooklyn, including an attack on an 11-year-old girl inside an elevator. 
The technician, Angus Pascall, 36, was convicted of first-degree rape, among other charges, for five separate attacks on young women and girls ages 11 to 22 stretching to 2001. Most of the assaults occurred in 2009 and 2010, the year he was arrested, the Kings County district attorney, Charles J. Hynes, said in a statement.
Mr. Pascall's lawyer, Edward Friedman, said his client would appeal the verdict.
In each of the attacks, Mr. Pascall was armed, sometimes with a gun or a knife. In one attack on a 19-year-old woman in 2009, he used a machete, the district attorney said. In the assault on the 11-year-old, he used his emergency responder's key to trap the victim inside an elevator. ''Pascall then put a gun to her face and repeatedly sexually assaulted her,'' according to the statement.
He is scheduled to be sentenced on Feb. 13, and he faces up to life in prison. Mr. Pascall had worked for the Fire Department for five years when he was arrested in 2010.

Sometimes common sense isn't a common trait.
Wayne LaPierre, the National Rifle Association's executive vice president, is a shining example of this. He continues to voice resistance to even the most basic kinds of changes in existing gun policy, changes that almost all Americans support, changes that would have little impact on the rights and ability of sane, law-abiding citizens to purchase legal weapons.
First, some background. 
The White House released its plan to reduce gun violence two weeks ago, a month after the horrific school shooting in Newtown, Conn.
The plan covered closing loopholes in the background check system, banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, as well as improving school safety and mental health services.
Public opinion polls suggested that people generally supported the president's plan.
A Gallup poll conducted the day after the president presented his plan found that 53 percent of Americans would want their representatives in Congress to vote for it.
An ABC/Washington Post poll last week found that 53 percent of Americans favored it.
And a Pew Research Center poll last week found that a majority of Americans thought the plan was about right or didn't go far enough. Only 31 percent thought that it went too far.
In fact, one of the greatest points of agreement among Americans is the need for universal background checks, as the president proposed.
A Gallup poll released last week found that 91 percent of Americans would vote to ''require criminal background checks for all gun sales'' if they could.
From a public relations perspective, trying to find some common ground on this issue with the public would seem a no-brainer. Not so for the No Brain-ers.
On Wednesday, at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on gun violence, LaPierre, as is his wont, gave a rambling, twisted argument against, that's right, universal background checks.
LaPierre said during the hearings:
''My problem with background checks is you are never going to get criminals to go through universal background checks. All the law-abiding people, you'll create an enormous federal bureaucracy, unfunded, hitting all the little people in the country, will have to go through it, pay the fees, pay the taxes."
He continued:
"We don't even prosecute anybody right now that goes through the system we have. So, we're going to make all those law-abiding people go through the system and then we aren't going to prosecute any of the bad guys if they do catch one. ''
So LaPierre's argument, if I can follow this spiral of spuriousness, is that if we don't prosecute ''bad guys,'' then there is no use in checking buyers in the first place so that ''bad guys'' could be identified and prevented from making the purchases. As best I can tell that seems to be it, and if that is it then I say: you can't be serious.
Senator Dick Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, shot back:
"Mr. LaPierre, that's the point. The criminals won't go to purchase the guns because there'll be a background check. We'll stop them from original purchase. You missed that point completely. It's basic."
The room erupted in applause.
Universal background checks would seem a basic and exceedingly reasonable proposal. I would add that there should also be universal prosecutions for being intentionally misleading during those checks. But LaPierre is a different kind of person. His interests are not the same as most Americans'. His organization and the majority of so-called ''pro gun rights'' groups are in the business of unfettered gun proliferation as a means of increasing gun industry profit.
This is about money, pure and simple.
Wednesday morning, before LaPierre's testimony, the Republican Joe Scarborough of MSNBC said on his show:
''You know what the greatest danger to that Second Amendment right and that guarantee is right now? Extremism from the survivalist wing of the N.R.A. that impacts Republicans' policies nationwide and moves the Republican Party so far away from mainstream America that they lose the House, they lose the Senate again in '14, and they lose the presidency again. And the next president will be Democratic.''
I would have to agree with that.
LaPierre is fanning paranoia because it helps grow the N.R.A.'s membership rolls and helps the N.R.A.'s friends and benefactors in the gun industry. And the N.R.A. uses its war chest to scare cowering politicians into taking unreasonable positions.
But extreme resistance to change is no longer acceptable with most of the public. People want action. They're demanding it. Extreme resistance in this climate could prove more politically poisonous, particularly to some Republicans, than upsetting the N.R.A.
At this moment you have an outraged public against the gun profiteers and the gutless politicians. I believe in the end the people will win.

A man who distrusted the government and was ''a survivalist type'' shot and killed a school bus driver on Tuesday in Midland City, then took a 6-year-old rider hostage, law enforcement officials said. After more than 24 hours, he was still holding the boy, who has a form of autism, in a well-supplied bunker buried on the man's property while the F.B.I. tried to negotiate the boy's release. The police delivered medication for the boy to the bunker, which was surrounded by SWAT teams. The Dale County Sheriff's Department identified the suspect as Jimmy Lee Dykes, 65. It said the episode began when Mr. Dykes stopped the bus and demanded to be let on. The driver, Charles Albert Poland Jr., 66, refused. As children escaped, Mr. Dykes fired at least four shots at the driver and grabbed the boy, according to the police and parents. The standoff continued into the evening Wednesday. The police said Mr. Dykes had been scheduled to appear in court Wednesday to face charges of menacing. He is accused of shooting at neighbors in an altercation involving a neighbor's driving on his property.

Animation Basks In Oscar Spotlight

BYLINE: By MELENA RYZIK

LOS ANGELES -- At one minute 45 seconds, with credits, ''Fresh Guacamole'' is the briefest film ever nominated for an Oscar. It's a stop-motion short in which that popular avocado dish is remade with different ingredients, starting with a grenade in place of the avocado. The short, made by an animator known as PES, is a sequel of sorts to ''Western Spaghetti,'' a stop-motion recipe of pickup sticks pasta and Rubik's cube garlic. It's the first film PES, born Adam Pesapane, submitted for Oscar consideration, a process that presented some challenges for a filmmaker whose work usually lives on YouTube. 
''You have to jump through some hoops'' to get a theatrical screening, as required by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Mr. Pesapane said in an interview on Tuesday from his home in Santa Monica, Calif. The film, commissioned by Showtime, had its premiere before ''The Artist'' at a Hollywood theater last year and was programmed by the Laemmle Theaters, an art-house chain here. Despite its brevity and deceptively simple concept the short took four months, upward of $50,000 and a team of technical experts to create. ''The guys who did 'The Dark Knight Rises,' the Bane mask, painted all the stuff for this film,'' Mr. Pesapane said.
With a career as a commercial director, Mr. Pesapane, 39, who is working on a feature-length project or two -- an adaptation of the Garbage Pail Kids series may get off the ground first -- said he hoped the Oscar nomination for his micro-opus would help him gain Hollywood momentum. Thanks to a recent rule change this year the entire membership of the Academy is invited to vote on entries in the short-film categories. (The Oscar-nominated shorts, animated and live action, open theatrically on Friday.)
''You can't get any higher award for making short films, let alone minute-and-40 second films,'' PES said. In place of the usual ''For Your Consideration'' ads that studios run touting their films, he and his wife and collaborator, Sarah Phelps, had another slogan idea: ''For Your Amusement.''
While no one was looking, this year's Oscars have become a hotbed for animation lovers. For starters an animator, Seth MacFarlane, a creator of ''Family Guy'' and ''The Cleveland Show,'' is hosting the ceremony on Feb. 24. There are 5 nominees for best animated film -- usually there are three -- reflecting a record 21 such features up for consideration this season. (There were also more contenders in the shorts categories.) Collectively the full-length Oscar hopefuls have made more than $542 million at the box office, mostly thanks to Pixar/Disney's ''Brave,'' a rebel princess story with a bow-and-arrow-shooting heroine, and ''Wreck-It Ralph,'' a pop culture mash-up of retro video games and cartoons. The other three nominees are done in stop-motion, an old animation form that rarely crops up so frequently in one year.
''When we did 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' in 1993, a stop-motion feature was pretty much unheard-of,'' said Tim Burton, whose ''Frankenweenie,'' using the same technique, is a nominee this year. It is based on a live-action short he made in 1984, when he was briefly an animator at Disney. ''Though even in the '80s Rick Heinrichs,'' his production designer, ''and I pitched it as a stop-motion film,'' Mr. Burton wrote in an e-mail. ''It seemed the perfect medium for the feature. There's something tangible and so beautifully textured about stop-motion. I've always loved it.''
And Mr. Burton helped inaugurate a generation of artists: Chris Butler worked on ''Corpse Bride'' (directed by Mr. Burton and Mike Johnson), a nominee in 2006, before going on to write and co-direct ''ParaNorman,'' another stop-motion nominee this year. Though the stop-motion films earned a fraction of the ticket sales of their fully digital compatriots, their triple recognition acknowledges ''the craftsmanship and the art that goes into these things,'' Mr. Butler said. ''We always say it's like making a live-action movie in miniature at a glacial pace.''
In a joint phone interview on Tuesday, Sam Fell, the other director of ''ParaNorman,'' about a boy who can communicate with ghosts, added that ''quite often it's the stop-motion movies that are more out there,'' adding, ''They're a little quirkier, they're a little harder to pin down.''
''Frankenweenie'' is a horror-inspired take on a boy who reanimates his dead dog, with gleefully, ghoulishly Burtonian results. Mr. Burton said that film is ''about how people question the value of science and art in this world, the creative mind in general, and accepting someone who thinks differently.''
Another nominee, ''The Pirates! Band of Misfits,'' directed by Peter Lord, is a resplendently silly tale that joins Charles Darwin, Queen Victoria and a formally clad chimp on the high seas.
With ''ParaNorman,'' ''Frankenweenie'' and ''The Pirates! Band of Misfits'' in production at roughly the same time, there was even a shortage of stop-motion experts. ''We had to find a whole bunch of people, the next generation even, young people who just made a short film in their bedroom,'' Mr. Fell said. ''It really grew the community this year.'' With the lengthy production process, ''one movie in this medium is long enough for someone to really progress from being very inexperienced to having a real handle on the medium,'' he said.
Since the animated feature category was introduced at the Oscars for 2001 productions, the Academy's short film and feature animation branch, which includes career cartoonists as well as designers and filmmakers, has regularly included stop-motion and hand-drawn fare -- the work on which many in the field cut their teeth. The nominees are chosen by a volunteer group of 100 to 125 Academy members, half from the animation branch and half not, who must watch at least three-fourths of the eligible films, all on the big screen, said Jon Bloom, a governor and the chairman of the branch. This has led to some grumbling that the committee is a self-selected group, perhaps retirees, whose tastes might skew to the pre-computer graphics era.
''The category is likened to foreign film and best picture, meaning that what we're instructed to vote on is the entire achievement,'' Mr. Bloom said. ''We're not voting on the best animation but the best animated film in its totality, and that means story and performance and animation and everything.''
The feature winners are chosen by the Academy over all. The animation industry's version of the Oscars, the Annies, will be handed out on Saturday; all five Oscar nominees are contenders there too, with other studio films like DreamWorks' ''Rise of the Guardians'' and Sony Pictures' ''Hotel Transylvania.'' ''Brave'' won the Golden Globe for animation but awards watchers are split on whether it, ''Frankenweenie,'' ''ParaNorman'' or ''Wreck-It Ralph'' lead the field at the Oscars. Clark Spencer, the producer of ''Wreck-It Ralph,'' whose art direction spans the evolution of video games, from the earliest eight-bit to the complex digital multiplayers today, said that as audiences have been primed by all different styles of animation, they are eager for more, whether that is a retro stop-motion look or a cutting-edge 3-D scene. ''You tell a great story, but people always want to know what's going to be unique about it visually,'' he said.
And the Academy, Mr. Bloom said, is acutely aware of the role that blockbuster animated films play in the telecast. That's why the award is usually presented early during the ceremony. ''The Academy is hoping to get interest in the Oscars from young viewers who may be going to bed soon afterward,'' he said, ''trying to indoctrinate a new generation.''

Chicago Girl's Shooting Death Jolts City and Touches Capital

BYLINE: By STEVEN YACCINO and CATRIN EINHORN; Steven Yaccino reported from Chicago, and Catrin Einhorn from New York.

CHICAGO -- When students filled the halls of King College Prep here on Wednesday, there was a sea of purple and red.
Purple was the favorite color of Hadiya Pendleton, 15, a classmate and member of the school's majorette team, which had just returned from Washington after performing at an event celebrating the inauguration of President Obama. 
Red symbolized gun violence, because Ms. Pendleton was killed on Tuesday by a gunshot to her back while hanging out with friends in a park not far from Mr. Obama's family home.
The details of her death shook Chicago and gave fuel to gun-control advocates in the running debate over firearms. The story traveled back to Washington on Wednesday, where Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, mentioned Ms. Pendleton during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing about gun violence, and the White House press secretary, Jay Carney, called it ''another example of the problem that we need to deal with.''
The shooting was not unfamiliar for some in Chicago, where gun violence has contributed to at least 40 deaths this year and more than 500 homicides in 2012.
''But you don't think at 2 in the afternoon at a park you're going to lose the one you love and care about,'' said Klyn Jones, a friend who was with Ms. Pendleton on the day she died.
Friends described Ms. Pendleton as a girl with an easy smile and generous nature. She loved Latin class and had worked hard on her overhand serve for the school volleyball team.
The inauguration trip was an inspiration, Ms. Jones said. ''He was an African-American from Chicago, and she is too,'' Ms. Jones said. ''It goes to show that as long as you put your mind to something, you can do it and affect the world.''
But on Tuesday, Ms. Pendleton and about 12 friends were at a park on the city's South Side, not far from the University of Chicago campus. When it started to rain, they all took shelter under a canopy. Ms. Jones said she looked up from her phone and saw a man jumping a fence.
He ran toward the group and started shooting, then jumped into a vehicle, which drove away, according to the police.
''It is believed that the offender mistook the group for gang members and fired at them,'' said Joshua Purkiss, an officer with the Chicago Police Department.
Another boy was shot once in the leg, but is in good condition. A third victim had a graze wound.
Ms. Jones said a friend cradled Ms. Pendleton's head in her lap as they waited for the ambulance. Ms. Jones held her hand. They thought she would pull through. At the hospital, they received the news.

Senate Hearing on Guns Suggests an Uphill Fight on New Limits

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 13

LENGTH: 1023 words

WASHINGTON -- The universe of potential changes to federal gun laws seemed to shrink Wednesday during an occasionally tense Senate hearing on gun violence as lawmakers and proponents of more gun rules tussled with gun rights advocates over the availability of some types of weapons and ammunition. In the end, chances for a ban on assault weapons dimmed, and compromise seemed elusive.
The hearing, the first held by the Senate Judiciary Committee since the mass shooting last month at a Newtown, Conn., school, began on a poignant note as former Representative Gabrielle Giffords, who was critically injured in a 2011 shooting, addressed the committee slowly but with passion, essentially begging panel members to come up with legislation to address gun violence. 
''Too many children are dying,'' she said to a packed, hushed hearing room. ''Too many children.''
After Ms. Giffords's brief testimony, the four-hour hearing quickly devolved into a litany of competing statistics and chilling anecdotes, laying bare the deep national divide between those who believe gun availability contributes to the nation's most violent crimes and those who think it helps prevent them.
Wayne LaPierre, the chief executive of the National Rifle Association, spoke ruefully of the many years he has spent trotting to Capitol Hill to testify about gun violence, and grew irritated under the questions of friend (Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, a vocal supporter of gun rights) and foe (Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, where an honor student in Chicago was fatally shot hours before the hearing).
Mr. LaPierre said he did not support the measure that appeared to be gaining the most support among both parties -- enhanced background checks for gun buyers -- raising the prospect that perhaps even modest changes to gun laws would be hard to accomplish. ''Universal background check, which sounds, whatever,'' he said, ''ends up being a universal federal nightmare imposed upon law-abiding people all over this country.
Mr. LaPierre's strong defense of existing gun laws, which he argued were poorly enforced, and his occasional pique were a contrast with Ms. Giffords's husband, Mark Kelly, a gun-owning former Navy captain and a retired astronaut, who quietly pulled, bit by bit, at the arguments against stronger background checks, which he and Ms. Giffords seek.
''I've been shot at dozens of times,'' Mr. Kelly said. ''I would suspect that not many members of this panel, or even in this room, for that matter, have been in any kind of a firefight. It is -- it is chaos. I think there are really some very effective things we can do. And one is, Senator, the background check. Let's make it difficult for the criminals, the terrorists, and the mentally ill to get a gun.''
The greatest area of disagreement centered around the availability of so-called assault weapons, which some Democratic senators seek to ban, and restrictions of large-size magazines, which several Republican senators and their witnesses argued would endanger potential victims of crime and infringe on the rights of law-abiding Americans.
Ms. Giffords, who made her way through the hearing room slowly, passing by several senators to bid them hello and give them a kiss, sat next to her husband and slowly began her remarks.
''This is an important conversation for our children, for our communities,'' Ms. Giffords said. ''For Democrats and Republicans. Speaking is difficult, but I need to say something important. Violence is a big problem,'' she continued. ''We must do something. It will be hard. But the time is now,'' she said, emphasizing the last word. ''You must act. Be bold. Be courageous. Americans are counting on you.''
With that, Ms. Giffords made her way quietly out of the room.
Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont and chairman of the committee, began by noting that ''the Second Amendment is secure and will remain secure and protected,'' adding, ''Americans have the right to self-defense and to have guns in their homes to protect their families.''
Mr. Leahy, who has a record of supporting measures like an assault weapons ban but also of defending the rights of gun owners in his largely rural state, said: ''No one can or will take those rights or our guns away,'' and added: ''But lives are at risk when responsible people fail to stand up for laws that will keep guns out of the hands of those who will use them to commit mass murder. I ask that we focus our discussion on additional statutory measures to better protect our children and all Americans.''
Mr. Leahy promoted his own bill that would give law enforcement officials more tools to investigate so-called straw purchasing of guns, in which people buy firearms for others. But he did not push for a ban on assault weapons, and except for Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, who has her own bill in which a ban renewal is central, most people's comments focused on background checks and mental health provisions to prevent the wrong people from obtaining guns.
Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, set the tone for gun-rights advocates by noting that while the tragedy of Newtown has shocked and rattled the nation, the events should not ''be used to put forward every gun-control measure that has been floating around for years.''
The hearing took some turns into gender and class politics, as Mr. LaPierre suggested that armed security details were the purview of the wealthy and the well connected, leaving regular Americans in peril.
''If you're in the elite, you get bodyguards,'' he said, adding, ''Criminals don't obey the law anyway.'' He also said that to the hard-working American ''we're going to say you can have a bolt-action rifle, but you can't have an AR-15.''
While advocates of more gun control tugged at emotions with anecdotes of random gun violence, one witness, Gayle Trotter, a senior fellow at the conservative Independent Women's Forum, argued for female gun ownership, citing the case of women protecting their children against an intruder. ''An assault weapon in the hands of a young woman defending her babies in her home becomes a defense weapon,'' she said.

Will Syria Bleed Hezbollah Dry?

BYLINE: By DANIEL NISMAN and DANIEL BRODE

SECTION: Section ; Column 0; OpEd; OP-ED CONTRIBUTORS; Pg. 

LENGTH: 972 words

''THE conventional army loses if it does not win. The guerrilla wins if he does not lose.'' Henry Kissinger's observation, made during the Vietnam War, should be haunting Hezbollah, the Middle East's most capable guerrilla force, as it becomes embroiled in an increasingly costly effort to save the Assad regime.
In a meticulously planned operation in October, units linked to the Free Syrian Army in the city of Qusayr near the Lebanon border killed Ali Hussein Nassif, who was quickly exposed as commander of all Hezbollah forces in Syria. His death shed light on the extent of the group's involvement in the conflict. 
Hezbollah's interest in preserving Bashar al-Assad's seat of power is well known, and its leader Hassan Nasrallah has spared no effort in reminding the world of his group's political support for the embattled dictator. For three decades, the Assad dynasty's support propelled Lebanon's largely peasant Shiite population into the halls of government, backed by an armed wing whose firepower rivals that of many conventional national armies.
Hezbollah's military commitment in Syria is no less obvious. Since the conflict's outset, Hezbollah commanders have joined their counterparts in the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in advising the Syrian military in its crackdown on opposition strongholds, in addition to training a reported 60,000-member militia to protect Alawite communities in Syria's coastal northwest. Thousands of Hezbollah-linked fighters have helped protect roughly 20 Shiite Syrian communities along the Lebanese border from sectarian-motivated attacks by hard-line rebels. Hezbollah is said to have used its arsenal to shell Sunni border communities acting as rebel strongholds.
Reports indicate that Hezbollah recently expanded its actions in Syria to include its most valued resource -- its highly trained and strategically irreplaceable special forces units. Hezbollah's secretive military wing is reportedly composed of 2,000 to 4,000 professional soldiers and thousands of reservists hailing from Shiite villages south of the Litani river and the Bekaa Valley, meant to be called into action to repel a future Israeli invasion. During the 2006 conflict with Israel, the loss of roughly one quarter of Hezbollah's special forces was assumed to constitute the group's most severe setback.
Varying reports from Syria suggest that the direct participation of these special forces units in combat zones nationwide has increased, and additional forces may be on the way. Secret contingency plans reportedly agreed upon at the highest levels of the Syrian government and Hezbollah indicate that Hezbollah had reportedly agreed to commit thousands of its most elite soldiers to defend the Assad regime, either from a ''foreign invasion'' or in the event that ''urgent assistance'' was needed.
With Syrian rebels consolidating their gains in outlying areas of Aleppo and Damascus, there are indications that Nasrallah has already begun to make good on his pledge. Earlier this month, a Saudi newspaper reported that four Hezbollah units, each consisting of 1,300 fighters, had been dispatched to assist the Syrian military in major cities, while the group's elite 901 commando unit has reportedly been fighting in the Homs area since July. Most recently, Hezbollah's reported deployments near Syrian chemical weapons facilities has spurred the Israeli government to threaten military intervention as a response to any potential attempt to transfer those weapons into Hezbollah bunkers in Lebanon.
Whether these moves were meant to protect these key facilities from sensitive sites or transfer their deadly materials, the deployment nonetheless testifies to the reality that these foreign Shiite militiamen have become one of Assad's most trusted fighting units.
Militarily and politically, Hezbollah has much at stake in the Syrian conflict, but it is risking even more by attempting to save a pariah regime that may not be savable. The group has incurred hundreds of losses against Syrian rebels, including its valued special forces. Hezbollah cannot outmatch rebel manpower, and will need to commit its best fighters and most sophisticated equipment to cut rebel supply lines in the hopes of hindering a Damascus invasion force from gaining traction.
Hezbollah's arsenal of nearly 70,000 rockets will likely remain pointed at the Israelis, but the squandering of its crucial elite units in Syria could deprive Lebanon's Shiite community of protection from emboldened sectarian rivals in the wake of Assad's ousting. Meanwhile, Hezbollah's assisting of the Assad regime in committing atrocities will put its leaders in the crosshairs of future international criminal tribunals, in addition to those already investigating the group's involvement in the assassination of the former Lebanon prime minister Rafik Hariri. Such negative attention may just spur the European Union to cave to U.S. pressure to place Hezbollah on its list of terror organizations, risking further isolation of the group's political wing.
Most threatening however, is Hezbollah's increasingly blatant violation of Lebanon's commitment to remain neutral in the Syrian conflict, a pledge made in the hopes of preserving the country's delicate sectarian balance. Nasrallah's support for Assad has placed Shiites and other minorities in the future line of fire of Syrian jihadists, many of whom are likely to turn their guns to Lebanon in retribution in the event of Assad's ousting.
Nasrallah has repeatedly affirmed his belief that the Assad regime will survive. Regardless of whether he is right, his assertions illustrate the fact that this conflict is one that Hezbollah desperately needs to win.

Gun Advocates Take Back Seat to Calls for Stricter Laws at Newtown Forum

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME; Kristin Hussey contributed reporting.

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 17

LENGTH: 870 words

NEWTOWN, Conn. -- In riveting testimony repeatedly interrupted by standing ovations, parents, public officials, law enforcement officers and school employees issued a full-throated call on Wednesday night for strengthening the nation's gun laws in the wake of the massacre of 26 children and educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School in December.
For one night at least, in the same high school auditorium where President Obama comforted the victims of Sandy Hook and issued his call for action on guns, the legislative muddle of competing lobbies and gun agendas was washed away by the grief of Sandy Hook and demands for measures to make sure something like it never happens again. 
David Wheeler, who lost his son, Benjamin, on Dec. 14, told a state legislative panel studying gun violence, mental health and school safety that his first-grade son died because an unstable suicidal individual ''had access to a weapon that has no place in a home.''
At the end of his three-minute remarks, he told a panel that Thomas Jefferson said government was instituted to protect our unalienable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. He said that those words and their order were no accident.
''The liberty of any person to own a military-style assault weapon and a high-capacity magazine and keep them in their home is second to the right of my son to his life,'' he said. ''His life, to the right to live of all of those children and those teachers, the rights of your children, of you, of all of us. Let's honor the founding documents and get our priorities straight.''
Testimony included repeated calls for improved mental health services and reflections on the responsibilities of parents. But the main focus was on the weapons used at Sandy Hook and in other mass slayings in the United States.
Brad Greene, who spoke surrounded by supporters of an antigun march scheduled for Feb. 14 in Hartford, said he and others had received a chilling education in the nation's gun laws.
''We have come away appalled at what our laws allow,'' he said. ''We are incredulous at the type of assault and semiautomatic weapons and magazine clips that are considered legal. What is the logic behind allowing anyone with a wad of cash to buy an arsenal without a background check? It's beyond our comprehension.''
Unlike at a hearing on Monday in Hartford, at which gun rights supporters from across the state turned out in force, proponents of gun control in green ribbons and stickers reading ''We Demand Change Now'' were by far the most conspicuous presence -- both in testimony and in the audience, which filled the Newtown High School auditorium. And local officials and residents, still scarred by the tragedy, demanded it lead to change, no matter how hard the legislative obstacles.
Susie Ehrens, whose daughter, Emma, escaped from the school, appealed to the legislators to act as if it were their own children who did not come home alive that day.
''We are Americans,'' she said. ''We stop being the world's greatest country when we allow our most vulnerable citizens to be slaughtered because we might offend people by taking away their guns. We stop being something to be proud of when we love our guns more than we love our children.''
Jim Gaston, a member of the Newtown Board of Selectmen, said he was a gun owner, owned rifles and enjoyed shooting.
''As a gun owner and someone who enjoys the sport,'' he said, ''I can assure you there is absolutely no reason that civilians need to have or should have access to high-powered assault weapons or mega-magazines.''
After the families, officials and school personnel testified, other members of the public spoke against new gun rules as well as for them.
David Barzetti said his 5-year-old son played with Jesse Lewis, one of the children who was killed. He said he understood the anguish over gun issues but did not believe more laws were needed.
''We are divided into two groups, one that thinks if we keep people from owning guns it can stop another 12/14 from happening,'' he said, referring to the date of the shooting. ''The other group wants to protect ourselves from others like Adam Lanza.''
He said gun control laws did not reduce crime and that gun owners should have choices of what weapons to own. ''Obviously we don't need an assault rifle to kill a deer, but we also don't need to take away a 500-horsepower vehicle from an owner who wants to own a high-powered vehicle. That's their choice.''
There were some vivid windows into the horror Dec. 14. Mary Ann Jacob, a school staff member, recalled the way it began as a routine Friday morning, how Victoria Soto, one of the teachers, grumbled that it was a bad day because she had spilled her coffee. Then came strange sounds that Ms. Jacob could not decipher until it became clear that hundreds of bullets were rocketing through the school.
''Make no mistake,'' she said. ''If there was a police officer in our building that day, he would be dead. Adam Lanza did not knock on the door and ask for permission to come in. He shot his way through the door barely seconds after he got out of his car.''
She added, ''Nobody needs a gun that can kill 26 people and shoot hundreds of rounds of ammunition in three minutes.''

Gunman In Phoenix Kills One And Flees

PHOENIX -- A gunman opened fire at an office complex here on Wednesday, killing one man and injuring two others before speeding away, the police said. Three other people were hospitalized for stress brought on by the shooting. 
A police spokesman identified the gunman as Arthur Harmon, 70.
The gunman opened fire just outside the lobby of the office complex after a mediation session at a law firm in the building over a lawsuit he had filed against a call center based in Scottsdale, Ariz., the authorities said. The call center's chief executive, Steven Singer, 48, who was at the session, was killed.
The shooting took place around 10:30 a.m. in the lobby of a three-story commercial building on North 16th Street, in the heart of the city. The police spokesman, Sgt. Tommy Thompson, said it was ''not random.'' The gunman ''came here for a reason,'' he said from the scene.
Among the injured was Mark Hummels, a lawyer at Osborne Maledon, who was representing Mr. Singer, according to a statement released by the firm. He was shot in the neck and lower back and remained in serious condition after surgery at John C. Lincoln Hospital, the statement said.
A woman in her 30s was being treated at the hospital for gunshot wounds that did not appear to be life-threatening, the police said.
Some witnesses told the police that they saw an ''older white man'' talking to two people before he opened fire. Others heard gunfire from inside their offices and hid under their desks.
Don Jacksa, a software engineer who works in the building, said he and his co-workers ''locked the doors and waited.'' Jeremiah Barnes, a driver for a rehabilitation clinic, said he was on his way out to lunch when he spotted a white car driving erratically in reverse out of the parking lot, barely missing incoming cars.
A middle school near the scene of the shooting was placed on lockdown as SWAT teams scoured the office complex, looking for the gunman.
In the afternoon, officers entered Mr. Harmon's home, some eight miles north of the office complex, but emerged several minutes later, empty-handed. As of early Wednesday evening, he remained at large. Sergeant Thompson said he should be considered ''armed and dangerous.''
One neighbor said Mr. Harmon was a retired salesman, reserved yet friendly to those he knew. Another neighbor said he liked to sit in his front yard, drinking beer, and to work on his car.

Political Power Needs to Be Used

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; EDITORIAL; Pg. 22

LENGTH: 595 words

If ever there were a moment for Democrats to press their political advantage, this is it. Their message on many of the biggest national issues -- taxes, guns, education spending, financial regulation -- has widespread support, and they have increased their numbers in both houses of Congress. But after years of being out-yelled by strident right-wing ideologues, too many in the Democratic Party still have a case of nerves, afraid of bold action and forthright principles.
That's particularly evident in the Senate, which the party controls. Last week, Democrats had a rare opportunity to change the Senate's rules by majority vote and reduce the routine abuse of the filibuster by Republicans, which has allowed a minority to slow progress to a crawl. But there weren't enough Democrats to support real reform, so a disappointing half-measure was approved. The reason was fear: Fear that they might return to the minority one day, fear that a weakened filibuster might hurt them, fear that Republicans might change the rules to the disadvantage of Democrats if they regain a majority. 
Similarly, fear is preventing many Democrats from fully embracing President Obama's sensible and long-overdue proposals on curbing gun violence. A proposal to require background checks on all gun buyers -- the top priority of most gun-control groups because of its effect on handgun proliferation -- is beginning to win strong bipartisan support. But Democrats from swing states -- including Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader -- are backing away from a bill to ban semiautomatic assault weapons, and it is not clear if the Senate will vote to prohibit high-capacity ammunition magazines.
Senate Democrats are not even united on the obvious need to raise additional tax revenues as part of budget agreements to reduce the deficit. Though Senator Charles Schumer of New York is pushing to raise more revenue through tax reform, Max Baucus of Montana, who leads the tax-writing Finance Committee, has resisted the idea.
Mr. Baucus, who has also expressed skepticism about an assault-weapons ban, comes from a state that supported Mitt Romney last year, as do most of the other nervous Democrats. It's true that the growing support for gun-control measures and for higher taxes on the rich is not spread evenly across the country, and that the party's majority in the Senate is precarious.
But senators have an obligation to lead public opinion, not to follow it blindly. Hunters in red states know full well that a semiautomatic weapon bristling with military features is unnecessary to bring down a deer or a duck. If Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, who just won re-election comfortably, were to make that case, he might change a few minds, given his unquestionable support for Second Amendment rights.
If Mr. Manchin explained that such a ban was anything but a ''gun grab,'' people would pay attention. Instead, though he supports background checks, he will not endorse anything further.
After four years of timidity, Senate Democrats say they will finally vote on a budget this year, no longer afraid to stand up for higher tax revenues and targeted spending increases. That is a sign of progress, but it remains to be seen how strong a budget will pass and how many Democrats will back it.
Politicians play in a rugged arena and are understandably obsessed about losing power. But that power needs to be used for something other than perpetual re-election. The next two years will challenge lawmakers of both parties to demonstrate that they came to Washington for a purpose.

As the Senate Debates Gun Control

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; LETTERS; Pg. 22

LENGTH: 893 words

To the Editor:
Justin Cronin's love letter to responsible gun ownership (''Confessions of a Liberal Gun Owner,'' Op-Ed, Jan. 28) doesn't change this liberal's position one iota. I, too, grew up in the Northeast, where I learned to handle firearms for target and skeet shooting as a teenager in summer camp. The Army trained me to assemble and fire a military rifle and .45-caliber pistol responsibly. I know the satisfaction of competently handling and firing a deadly weapon.
Yet when I picture that dark movie theater in Aurora, Colo., and what might have happened had one or more legally armed people attempted to return that shooter's fire, I cannot endorse a society in which even responsible, licensed citizens among us routinely carry firearms. 
Even highly trained, experienced police officers are challenged to make split-second, potentially deadly decisions when confronted with real-world shooters mixed in with civilians. It's only a matter of time before some innocents end up getting shot by a would-be vigilante. And please explain just how the police are expected to correctly determine which shooter is the perpetrator?
The pro-gun folks are right: Responsible gun ownership is legal and generally no more threatening to others than driving a car. Nevertheless, people do get drunk or high on drugs, fight with their partners or co-workers, or get depressed and suicidal. Every day, people do stupid things with their cars and their guns, sometimes injuring or killing others.
Our shamefully high incidence of gun deaths is clear evidence that we don't take this responsibility seriously enough. Gun ownership should require mandatory training, licensing, insurance and annual registration.
DEAN FOX Foster City, Calif., Jan. 28, 2013
To the Editor:
After a month of hysterical hand-wringing, it is a relief to see a rational discussion of gun ownership, self-defense and social meltdown.
Compared with most of the world, the United States has been spared huge social upheaval caused by war or natural disaster. But when our luck finally runs out and society falls apart, self-defense will be central to individual survival, and all the current feel-good moralizing will seem fatally naןve. Helplessness is neither admirable nor moral.
LAURENCE FRANK Hillsborough, Calif., Jan. 28, 2013
To the Editor:
The most striking fact of Justin Cronin's confession is the event that led him to purchase his first firearm. It was when nothing happened to him.
Yes, evacuation during Hurricane Rita must have been fraught with fear, anxiety, confusion, tension. But where was the violence? In the writer's imagination, in hindsight. He succumbed to the fear that something ''could have'' happened, even though nothing did.
The gun debate orbits around the fear of boogeymen, minorities, strangers. How ironic that most legal gun owners neither live in the most dangerous American cities nor have they been victims of crime. Only when Americans stop being afraid will we make any true progress.
SHAHRYAR MOTIA Brooklyn, Jan. 28, 2013
To the Editor:
So let's get this straight. In their pious Jan. 30 Op-Ed essay, ''Bipartisan Hunting Buddies,'' James A. Baker III and John D. Dingell say that one way to curb gun violence is for parents to yank their kids away from their video games and take them out to kill something small and defenseless? They also call for ''common sense'' in making gun laws. There seems to be a disconnect here.
TERRY SHAMES Berkeley, Calif., Jan. 30, 2013
To the Editor:
Re ''Selling a New Generation on Guns'' (''Bearing Arms'' series, front page, Jan. 27):
It comes as no surprise that the gun industry, like Big Tobacco at one time, deliberately targets children in order to groom a new generation of consumers.
As the reporting makes abundantly clear, the National Rifle Association and the National Shooting Sports Foundation are trade organizations whose only mission is to increase sales. Behind their meretricious arguments that firearm use somehow develops ''life skills'' or teaches responsibility is the real bottom line: profits.
PATRICK WALSH Princeton, N.J., Jan. 27, 2013
The writer is a former infantry officer.
To the Editor:
Re ''What We Don't Know Is Killing Us'' (editorial, Jan. 27):
That the gun lobby has effectively shut down government-financed research on gun violence for 17 years exposes just how shaky its self-confidence is. Many of us are willing to accept gun ownership in exchange for sane public safety measures based on objective data. So if guns ultimately make us safer in and out of our homes, then why not give researchers a chance to prove it? Until the gun lobby is willing to face facts, it will be running scared, and with good reason.
ANDREW SOFER Jamaica Plain, Mass., Jan. 28, 2013
To the Editor:
The Jan. 29 column by Joe Nocera, ''And in Last Week's Gun News...,'' was brilliant. Listing both accidental and purposeful shootings day by day plainly reveals the depth and ordinariness of our gun culture.
Anger and the wish to kill will always be part of human life, but we do not have to make it so easy and commonplace to destroy the lives of neighbors, strangers and family members, instantaneously.
It is the gun culture that needs to be killed. And that will not be easy. The time to do it is now, while we still have the capacity to be appalled.

Mayor Says He Uttered No Remark On a Derriטre

BYLINE: By KATE TAYLOR

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 25

LENGTH: 468 words

On Monday, he did not meet with reporters after testifying before the Legislature in Albany. On Tuesday, he refused to take questions on anything but his budget proposal at City Hall. On Wednesday, he did not appear in public. 
But ultimately, there was no avoiding the subject, and on Thursday, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg fielded the inquiry that has intrigued the City Hall press corps for days: Did he really make an ungentlemanly remark about a woman's attractive backside at a Christmas party last year?
Mr. Bloomberg, never one to mince words, denied the comment that was attributed to him in an article in New York magazine this week.
''I never said it, and I don't know where it came from,'' he told reporters in Harlem at a New York City Housing Authority community center.
When the questioner, Hunter Walker of The New York Observer, further suggested that the quotation might reflect a pattern of sexist remarks by the mayor, Mr. Bloomberg snapped: ''Don't be ridiculous. That's an outrage for you to say that.''
The quotation appeared in a profile of the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, whom Mr. Bloomberg is believed to see as the best candidate in the race to succeed him. The reporter for New York magazine, Jonathan Van Meter, wrote that he was at a Christmas party on the Upper East Side when he and a friend went up to Mr. Bloomberg. His friend thanked the mayor for his efforts on behalf of gun control. The mayor, Mr. Van Meter said, ignored the comment, instead gesturing to a woman standing nearby in a tight, floor-length gown and making the alleged remark on her derriטre.
Mr. Van Meter went on to quote Ms. Quinn as saying that Mr. Bloomberg upbraids her when she wears flat shoes and mocks her when she is late dyeing her hair and her roots show. She also described him as having ''a potty mouth.''
A spokeswoman for New York magazine, Shama Hussain, said it stood by Mr. Van Meter's reporting.
On Thursday, after shutting down Mr. Walker, the mayor turned to Marcia Kramer, a reporter for WCBS-TV.
''Miss, do you have a question?'' Mr. Bloomberg asked her.
''I just wondered why you've become the fashion police, giving Christine Quinn advice about wearing high heels and getting her roots done,'' she asked.
Mr. Bloomberg, taking a slightly more modulated tone than with Mr. Walker, replied curtly: ''Miss, if she asks, when we have a conversation and joke about it, there's nothing wrong with that.''
Ms. Quinn later e-mailed a comment, through a spokeswoman, making light of the matter: ''The mayor and I have a productive, collegial and fun working relationship,'' she said.
''Part of that is a healthy banter in the way only two tough outspoken New Yorkers can have. We joke around, and it's all in good fun. By the way, did you notice the hideous tie the mayor was wearing today?''

Georgia: Student Wounded In Middle School Shooting

LENGTH: 117 words

A student opened fire at an Atlanta middle school on Thursday afternoon, wounding a 14-year-old in the neck before an armed officer working there was able to wrest the gun away, the police said. Multiple shots were fired in the courtyard of Price Middle School, just south of downtown, about 1:50 p.m., Police Chief George Turner said. The boy who was wounded was taken ''alert, conscious and breathing'' to Grady Memorial Hospital, a police spokesman said. Hospital officials said the boy had been discharged by Thursday night. The police said charges were pending against the boy who opened fire. Investigators said that they believed it was not a random shooting and that the 14-year-old was the target.

Myths About Gun Regulation

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; EDITORIAL; Pg. 26

LENGTH: 471 words

As busy as the gun lobby is in promoting macho myths about self-defense -- stand your ground and outshoot the bad guys -- it is no less dedicated to spinning myths for lawmakers to use as excuses to avoid enacting laws to deal with the shooting sprees that regularly afflict the nation. This was clear at the opening Senate hearing on gun controls this week, where Judiciary Committee members seemed to have largely swallowed gun lobby propaganda that the evidence shows the original 10-year ban on assault weapons was ineffective. 
Left unsaid was the fact that one of the loopholes that enabled passage of the original ban limited research on the law's effectiveness to the first year's data rather than allow more conclusive long-term studies. A long--range, independent study issued as Congress allowed the ban to expire in 2004 found criminal use of assault weapons had fallen by one-third or more as a share of gun crimes in major jurisdictions.
The information is there if Congress is interested. After the ban expired, 37 percent of police departments reported noticeable increases in criminals' use of assault weapons, according to a 2010 report by the Police Executive Research Forum.
In Virginia, the number of guns with high-capacity magazines seized by police dropped after they were included in the 1994 weapons ban, but then rebounded sharply after the ban expired, according to a 2011 study by The Washington Post. Maryland enacted its own more stringent ban on assault weapons in 1994, and a 55 percent drop in assault pistols from crime scenes was reported by the Baltimore police.
The false statistics comfort members of Congress who fear the gun lobby or their more conservative constituents, or both, and are blocking a new and stronger ban on assault weapons proposed by Senator Dianne Feinstein. The need for that ban and its outlawing of magazines of more than 10 bullets goes to the heart of the tragedy in Newtown, Conn., where a shooter took only a few minutes to trigger a rapid firing assault weapon and slay 20 schoolchildren and six educators last December.
''Too many children are dying,'' former Representative Gabrielle Giffords declared at the Senate hearing, her speech made halting by the head wounds she suffered in a 2011 gun assault. ''You must act. Be bold,'' she pleaded with the lawmakers.
Since the hearing run by Senator Patrick Leahy seemed stacked with opponents of a new ban, Senator Feinstein is scheduling her own hearing with a fairer slate of witnesses reflecting the public's concern about the carnage from assault weapons. The judiciary hearing should be a call to President Obama to fight hard for maximum public involvement if an assault weapons ban is ever to have a chance in congress. ''Be courageous,'' Ms. Giffords advised the lawmakers. ''Americans are counting on you.''

Small Town in Alabama Confronts Boy's Kidnapping

BYLINE: By ROBBIE BROWN and KIM SEVERSON; Robbie Brown reported from Midland City, Ala., and Kim Severson from Atlanta.

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 13

LENGTH: 957 words

MIDLAND CITY, Ala. -- Many things hold little Southern towns together. There is a common love of the region, the peace that comes with a rural life and, often, prayer.
In this town of 2,300 in the heart of peanut country, people drew on all of those as they endured what by Thursday night had stretched into an unimaginable situation.
A relative newcomer to town -- a man who had fought in Vietnam and appeared to harbor a deep distrust of government and a grudge against every neighbor -- shot and killed a bus driver on Tuesday, grabbed a 5-year-old boy named Ethan and then disappeared with the boy into a well-equipped bunker he had spent several months digging in his yard. 
By all accounts, the man that neighbors and a sheriff's office official identified as Jimmy Lee Dykes, 65, had no connection to the boy.
''As far as we know, there is no relation at all,'' said Michael Senn, a pastor at the Midway Assembly of God Church, who comforted some of the children who escaped from the bus and ran to his church. ''He just wanted a child for a hostage situation.'' Like so many clerics in this Bible-reading community, Mr. Senn has been leading prayer services as the hours have stretched into days.
By late Thursday, no end was in sight. The F.B.I. stayed in contact with Mr. Dykes by day and let him sleep at night, said Police Chief James Arrington of Pinckard, a nearby city.
''They're taking time and trying to wear him out,'' he said. ''He may do harm if they try to rush him. We don't know how much ammunition or bombs he has.''
Mr. Dykes, neighbors said, has been known to stay in his bunker for up to eight days. Some said they watched him build it, carrying cinder blocks and digging for hours.
No one is sure exactly why he took the boy. ''He don't care too much for the government,'' Chief Arrington said. ''That's all we know.''
The boy, whom his mother calls ''love bug,'' is reportedly doing well in the bunker, an Alabama state senator, Harri Anne Smith, said in a television interview early Thursday. She and State Representative Steve Clouse have met with Ethan's mother, and said food and medication her son needed for autism was delivered to the bunker through a 60-foot plastic pipe that was about four inches in diameter.
Still, Mr. Clouse said, the family is ''just holding on by a thread.''
As it became clear that the standoff would continue -- the bunker was well supplied with food and, apparently, a television and lights -- the national news media began arriving.
Through Wednesday and into Thursday, residents watched as their tiny town, where the National Peanut Festival in nearby Dothan is usually the biggest event of the year, became a near-constant presence on national television.
The killing of the bus driver and the resulting standoff soon became one more point of discussion in the national debate about guns. Many people here own guns and hunt and are steadfast in their belief that guns are not the problem, mental health is.
Around town and along the entrance to the dirt road where the bunker was sunk into Mr. Dykes's land, people began arguing in favor of allowing bus drivers to carry guns.
''I follow the old Boy Scouts motto, 'Be prepared,' '' said James Alexander, 72, who said he sleeps with a gun by his pillow. ''I cannot foresee a way to prevent this without shooting the guy.''
Although reporters were held across the highway from a red dirt road that leads into a wooded area with about a dozen houses, and there were no major developments to report on Thursday, on television the story was regularly spliced between coverage of state and national hearings on gun violence and mental health prompted by the shootings in Newtown, Conn., in December.
''It's crazy,'' said Tyler Cobb, a high school junior who was one of more than 90 students who met to pray for Ethan on Wednesday. ''It happened in Connecticut. But it really hits home when it happens here. Our little town on CNN. It's just weird.''
Prayer vigils sprung up like farm stands in the summer here. Five were held Wednesday, and on Thursday members of a church youth group gathered to pray across the highway from the road that leads to bunker.
Prayer took hold on social media sites, too. A Twitter call to pray for Ethan gained steam.
The bus driver, Charles Albert Poland Jr., 66, encountered Mr. Dykes on the way home from school on Tuesday. The bus stopped and Mr. Dykes jumped on, according to police reports based on interviews with children on the bus, and then he demanded two boys between the ages of 6 and 8.
Mr. Poland held Mr. Dykes at the front of the bus while 21 children escaped out the back. He was hit with as many as four bullets from a 9-millimeter pistol. The well-liked driver was quickly called a hero by residents.
With the driver down, Mr. Dykes grabbed two children, the police said. One escaped. Ethan may have frozen or fainted, allowing Mr. Dykes to take him swiftly from the bus.
Tim Byrd, chief investigator with the Dale County Sheriff's Office, told the Southern Poverty Law Center's Hatewatch blog that Mr. Dykes was a Vietnam veteran with post-traumatic stress who ''did not trust the government.''
He was also scheduled to face charges of menacing in court on Wednesday after neighbors said that he shot a gun at them in a dispute over someone driving on his property.
Meanwhile, the community here did what small communities do. It did not take long for churchgoers to start cooking, joining the Salvation Army and the Red Cross to feed more than 50 F.B.I. negotiators and law enforcement officers from at least eight agencies.
''Everybody wants to help; everybody is talking about the boy,'' said Lisa Boatwright, a secretary at a nearby church. ''But there's only one thing we can do: pray this ends safely.''

Victims, Victims Everywhere

BYLINE: By DANIEL LANSBERG-RODRֽGUEZ

SECTION: Section ; Column 0; OpEd; OP-ED CONTRIBUTOR; Pg. 

LENGTH: 839 words

Three years ago I was giving a ride home to the sister of my cousin's girlfriend in Caracas, when we were violently kidnapped and held for ransom overnight.
I prefer not to dwell on the specifics of the experience: the hollow sound of an assault rifle tapping a car window, the voices of terrified loved ones negotiating my life over speakerphone. It could have been much worse.
Through a series of bizarre coincidences and lucky breaks, we emerged from the experience largely unharmed, before any money changed hands. And having since married my fellow hostage, I look forward to someday regaling our children with what is perhaps a uniquely Venezuelan ''How I Met Your Mother'' story. 
But last week upon hearing news of an outbreak of violence at Uribana prison, about 275 kilometers west of Caracas -- a phenomenon that, like kidnappings, has become all too common in Venezuela -- one of the more surreal vignettes from that interminable night came back to mind.
I was in the back of an S.U.V., with the point of a pistol digging into my ribcage, and the man holding the gun was explaining why he wasn't a bad person.
He was insisting that he and his fellow kidnappers were victims at least as much as we, the hostages, were. Whatever they had done, and still might do, was but an inevitable consequence of generations of social injustice. As beneficiaries of that injustice, we were fair game. And they were modern-day Jean Valjeans, acting out of necessity so that they could provide for their families.
This mentality also cuts to the heart of what happened at Uribana prison. Our five kidnappers that night were off-duty police officers who were trying to supplement their anemic government wages. Like them, prison guards, wardens and national guardsmen in Venezuela also find creative ways to monetize their authority, burying any qualms under a bevy of rationalizations.
Uribana prison was built just this century, supposedly as a model institution that would usher in a rehabilitative approach to the penitentiary system. Instead, it has become a symbol of Venezuela's history of prison violence.
The latest riot erupted after the state authorities decided to confiscate accumulated stocks of contraband, primarily weapons, from the inmates. The prisoners resisted, and a firefight ensued, killing over 60 people and injuring 120.
It's a common occurrence: Every year since 2010, there has been at least one prison tragedy in which 50 or more people have been killed or seriously injured. In 2009 there were 366 deaths because of prison violence -- already more than the combined totals for Brazil, Mexico and Colombia (countries with far larger overall populations than Venezuela) -- and by 2012 the number had jumped to 523.
Why? There are important structural factors at work. With 33 prisons in Venezuela, each with three times as many prisoners as they are supposed to hold, overcrowding, aging infrastructure, appalling living conditions and corruption are common.
But Venezuela shares those problems with much of Latin America, and it has far more financial resources to deal with them than do most of its neighbors. It also keeps a far smaller portion of its population incarcerated: 37 per 100,000 people, compared with 88 per 100,000 for Chile, 110 per 100,000 for Mexico and 251 per 100,000 for Brazil.
A better explanation is that the revolutionary rhetoric of Hugo Chבvez's regime has acclimated everyday Venezuelans to the idea of the necessary evil. Over the past 14 years, the government has routinely communicated that the nobility of an act and its legality are not necessarily the same.
Chבvez's supporters are told they have been victimized by colonialism and perfidious elites at home; the opposition feels just as victimized by the current regime. And victims do what they have to do.
As an old Venezuelan proverb says: ''The thief who steals from a thief has a hundred years of pardon.''
The implications for the prison system are perverse. In exchange for payoffs from prisoners, guards let drugs and arms flood in. Why not, given low wages and sky-high inflation? And the same broken system that routinely keeps suspects in extended pretrial detention and sends them to common prisons deliberately turns a blind eye toward the extracurricular activities of its police officers and prison guards.
Many Venezuelan prisons have come to be run by the inmates while the guards prowl the perimeter. Then, every so often the power dynamics shift. A higher-up gets worried. Outside forces are brought in to remove the prisoners' growing stockpiles of arms or drugs. The prisoners resist, and violence breaks out.
Once the smoke clears and the dead have been hauled away, independent media outlets blame the government. The government blames its enemies.
Then money and arms change hands again. The cycle begins anew. Everyone is a victim.

Timbuktu Endured Terror Under Harsh Shariah Law

TIMBUKTU, Mali -- When the Islamist militants came to town, Dr. Ibrahim Maiga made a reluctant deal. He would do whatever they asked -- treat their wounded, heal their fevers, bandage up without complaint the women they thrashed in the street for failing to cover their heads and faces. In return, they would allow him to keep the hospital running as he wished.
Then, one day in October, the militants called him with some unusual instructions. Put together a team, they said, bring an ambulance and come to a sun-baked public square by sand dunes.
There, before a stunned crowd, the Islamist fighters carried out what they claimed was the only just sentence for theft: cutting off the thief's hand. As one of the fighters hacked away at the wrist of a terrified, screaming young man strapped to a chair, Dr. Maiga, a veteran of grisly emergency room scenes, looked away. 
''I was shocked,'' he said, holding his head in his hands. ''But I was powerless. My job is to heal people. What could I do?''
After nearly 10 months of occupation by Islamists fighters, many of them linked with Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, the people of this ancient mud-walled city recounted how they survived the upending of their tranquil lives in a place so remote that its name has become a synonym for the middle of nowhere.
''Our lives were turned upside down,'' Dr. Maiga said. ''They had guns, so whatever they asked, we did. It was useless to resist.''
It has been only a few days since French and Malian troops marched into Timbuktu after heavy airstrikes chased the militants away, part of a surprisingly rapid campaign to retake northern Mali from the militants who held it captive for months. On Thursday, France's defense minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, told French radio that the intervention had ''succeeded'' and reached ''a point of change.''
But while the Islamist militants have retreated to the desert, there are no illusions that they have ceased to be a threat. As American officials praised the speed of the French-led operation to recapture northern cities, they also cautioned that a lengthy campaign would be needed to root out the militants from their desert redoubts -- and that it was not immediately clear who would carry out the daunting task.
''This is all being done very much on the fly,'' one American official said of the intervention. ''The challenge will be to keep up the pressure when the sense is to declare victory and go home.''
Here in Timbuktu, life is certainly a long way from returning to normal. Shops owned by Arab tradesmen have been looted. Some residents have fled, a foretaste of ethnic strife that many fear will roil Mali for years to come. Electricity and running water are available only a few hours a day. The cellphone network remains down.
Many of the residents who left -- first to escape the occupation, then to escape the French airstrikes -- have no way to return. Always remote, the city remains dangerously isolated: the dusty tracks and rivers leading here wind through forbidding scrubland territory that could still provide refuge for the Islamist fighters who melted away from the cities.
Those who remained told stories of how they survived the long occupation: by hiding away treasured manuscripts and amulets forbidden by the Islamists, burying crates of beer in the desert, standing by as the tombs of saints they venerated were reduced to rubble, silencing their radios to the city's famous but now forbidden music.
''They tried to take away everything that made Timbuktu Timbuktu,'' said Mahalmoudou Tandina, a marabout, or Islamic preacher, whose ancestors first settled in Timbuktu from Morocco in the 13th century. ''They almost succeeded.''
The occupation of Timbuktu, a center of learning for centuries, was the latest in a long historical list of conquests -- by Arab nations, by the Songhai and Maasina empires, by France. Once again, powerful global forces were in play in this fabled city: a network of Islamic extremists, the armies of France and West Africa, and to a lesser extent the United States, which has flown in French forces and refueled French warplanes during the campaign.
Through it all, the city's residents, whose ancestors endured such ravages for the better part of a millennium, have adapted as best they could.
On April 1, the day rebels arrived in this city, Mr. Tandina had just returned from the first, predawn prayer of the day. He made bittersweet tea to the murmur of a French radio broadcast. The news was bad: Gao, the largest city in northern Mali, had fallen to Tuareg rebels, the nomadic fighters who had been battling the Malian state for decades.
His hometown was almost certainly their next target. When shots rang out in Independence Square, just behind Mr. Tandina's house, he knew that Timbuktu's latest conquerors had arrived.
''The barbarians were at our gate,'' he said with a sigh. ''And not for the first time.''
The Tuareg fighters took control of the city, and for two days they looted its sprawling markets, raped women, stole cars and killed anyone who stood in their way.
''Then the man with the big beard came,'' Mr. Tandina said.
Barrel-chested and dressed in a blue tunic, the leader of Ansar Dine, an Islamist group with links to Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, arrived with several truckloads of fighters. The new rebels called the city's people to a public square and made an announcement.
''They said, 'We are Muslims. We came here to impose Shariah,' '' Mr. Tandina said.
At first, Timbuktu's people were relieved, he said. Beginning a hearts-and-minds campaign, the group garrisoned the fearsome Tuareg nationalists outside of town, which stopped the raping and pillaging.
They did not charge for electricity or collect taxes. Commerce went on more or less as usual, he said.
Then a mysterious group of visitors came from Gao, heavily armed men riding in pickup trucks, trailing desert dust.
''They told us they were here to establish an Islamic republic,'' Mr. Tandina said.
It started with the women. If they showed their faces in the market they would be whipped. The local men grew angry at attacks on their wives, so they organized a march to the headquarters of the Islamic police, who had installed themselves in a bank branch.
The Islamists greeted the protesters by shooting in the air. Many fled, but a small group, including Mr. Tandina, insisted that they be heard.
A young, bearded man came out to meet them. Much to Mr. Tandina's surprise, he recognized the Islamic police official. His name was Hassan Ag, and before the fighting began he had been a lab technician at the local hospital.
''When I knew him he was cleanshaven, and he wore ordinary clothes of a bureaucrat,'' Mr. Tandina said.
Now he was dressed in the uniform of the Islamist rebellion: a tunic, loose trousers cut well above the ankle, in imitation of the Prophet Muhammad, and a machine gun slung across his shoulder.
''I told him our women were being harmed,'' he said.
Mr. Ag was unmoved.
''This is Islamic law,'' he said, according to Mr. Tandina. ''There is nothing I can do. And the worst is yet to come.''
Soon it came. They began destroying tombs of the saints venerated by Timbuktu's Muslims. Armed with pickaxes and sledgehammers, they reduced to rubble the tomb of Sidi Mahmoud, a saint who, according to legend, protected the city from invaders.
Venerating saints, an ancient practice here, was considered un-Islamic in the austere version of the faith proclaimed by the occupiers.
Mr. Tandina said he tried to use his decades of Koranic education to argue with the Islamists, citing verses about respecting the burial places. They would not listen.
Before long, he said, amputations started. Then came the executions. Again he said he tried to intervene, going to the Islamic court with stacks of Islamic law books under his arm.
''Islam was whatever they said it was,'' he said. ''They did not respect the holy book. They respected nothing but their own desires.''
For hundreds of years, Timbuktu was one of the world's most important centers of Islamic learning. The city has dozens of mosques, and it is famous for the ancient, handwritten manuscripts that city residents have collected for generations, preserving them against waves of invaders and creating a priceless trove of knowledge about the Islamic world and beyond. Many families have long traditions of Islamic learning, passed from father to son.
So many here bristled when the Islamists called the population to lecture them about the proper practice of the religion in which they had been raised.
''What they call Islam is not what we know is Islam,'' said Dramane Cissי, the 78-year-old imam at one of the city's biggest and oldest mosques. ''They are arrogant bullies who use religion as a veil for their true desires.''
But like many Muslims here, he hid away his amulets, prayer beads and other banned religious items. In his mind his faith remained the same.
''I was born in my religion and I will die in my religion,'' Mr. Cissי said. ''I know what I believe and nothing can change that.''
The compromises Dr. Maiga made to keep his hospital going continue to haunt him.
After the young man's hand was cut off, the Islamists held it aloft and shouted ''God is great'' over and over, he said.
Dr. Maiga and his team hustled the young man into the ambulance and rushed him into the operating room to cauterize the wound, giving him powerful painkillers.
''I did what I had to do,'' he said. ''God help us.''

Focus on Mental Health Laws to Curb Violence Is Unfair, Some Say

BYLINE: By ERICA GOODE and JACK HEALY

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 13

LENGTH: 1412 words

In their fervor to take action against gun violence after the shooting in Newtown, Conn., a growing number of state and national politicians are promoting a focus on mental illness as a way to help prevent further killings.
Legislation to revise existing mental health laws is under consideration in at least a half-dozen states, including Colorado, Oregon and Ohio. A New York bill requiring mental health practitioners to warn the authorities about potentially dangerous patients was signed into law on Jan. 15. In Washington, President Obama has ordered ''a national dialogue'' on mental health, and a variety of bills addressing mental health issues are percolating on Capitol Hill.
But critics say that this focus unfairly singles out people with serious mental illness, who studies indicate are involved in only about 4 percent of violent crimes and are 11 or more times as likely than the general population to be the victims of violent crime.
And many proposals -- they include strengthening mental health services, lowering the threshold for involuntary commitment and increasing requirements for reporting worrisome patients to the authorities -- are rushed in execution and unlikely to repair a broken mental health system, some experts say. 
''Good intentions without thought make for bad laws, and I think we have a risk of that,'' said J. Reid Meloy, a forensic psychologist and clinical professor at the University of California, San Diego, who has studied rampage killers.
Moreover, the push for additional mental health laws is often driven by political expediency, some critics say. Mental health proposals draw support from both Democrats and Republicans, in part because, unlike bans on semiautomatic weapons or high-capacity magazines -- like the one proposed in the Senate last week -- they do not involve confrontation with gun rights groups like the National Rifle Association.
''The N.R.A. is far more formidable as a political foe than the advocacy groups for the mentally ill,'' said Dr. Jeffrey A. Lieberman, chairman of psychiatry at Columbia University and president-elect of the American Psychiatric Association.
Indeed, the N.R.A. itself, in response to the massacre in Newtown, argued that mental illness, and not the guns themselves, was at the root of recent shooting sprees. The group called for a national registry of people with mental illness -- an alternative that legal experts agree would raise at least as many constitutional alarms as the banning of gun ownership.
For mental health groups, the proposals under consideration are tantalizing: By increasing services for those with mental illness, they raise the possibility of restoring some of the billions of dollars cut from mental health programs in recent years as budgets tightened in the financial downturn. The measures also hold out hope for improvement of a mental health system that many experts say is fragmented and drastically inadequate. And some proposals -- those to revise commitment laws, for example -- have the support of some mental health organizations.
But some mental health and legal experts say that politicians' efforts might be better spent making the process of involuntary psychiatric commitment -- and the criteria for restricting firearms access once someone has been forcibly committed -- consistent from state to state. And some proposals have caused concern, raising questions about doctor-patient confidentiality, the rights of people with psychiatric disabilities and the integrity of clinical judgment.
Especially troublesome to some mental health advocates are provisions like New York's, which expand the duty of practitioners to report worrisome patients -- a model likely to be emulated by other states. New York's law, part of a comprehensive package to address gun violence, requires reporting to the local authorities any patient ''likely to engage in conduct that would result in serious harm to self or others.'' Law enforcement officials would then be authorized to confiscate any firearm owned by such a patient.
John Monahan, a psychologist and professor of law at the University of Virginia, said that such laws are often superfluous.
Although many mental health practitioners mistakenly believe that federal laws like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act forbid them to disclose information about patients, such statutes already include exceptions that permit clinicians to give information to the authorities when a patient presents a threat to others, Dr. Monahan said.
Most states also have laws requiring mental health professionals to notify the authorities and any intended victim when a patient makes a direct threat.
New York's provision, Dr. Monahan said, differs from virtually every other state's laws in allowing guns to be taken not only from those committed against their will but also from patients who enter treatment voluntarily.
''The devil is in the details,'' he said of New York's new law. ''The two fears are that people will be deterred from seeking treatment that they need or that, once they are in treatment, they will clam up and not talk about violence.''
Most mental health experts agree that the link between mental illness and violence is not imaginary. Studies suggest that people with an untreated severe mental illness are more likely to be violent, especially when drug or alcohol abuse is involved. And many rampage killers have some type of serious mental disorder: James E. Holmes, accused of opening fire in a movie theater in Colorado in July, was seeing a psychiatrist who became alarmed about his behavior; Jared L. Loughner, who killed 6 people and injured 13 others in Arizona, including former Representative Gabrielle Giffords, was severely mentally ill.
But such killings account for only a tiny fraction of gun homicides in the United States, mental health experts point out. Besides the research indicating that little violent crime can be linked to perpetrators who are mentally ill, studies show that those crimes are far more likely to involve battery -- punching another person, for example -- than weapons, which account for only 2 percent of violent crimes committed by the mentally ill.
Because of this, some criminal justice experts say it makes more sense to pass laws addressing behavior, rather than a diagnosis of mental illness. In Indiana, for example, firearms can be confiscated from people deemed a potential threat, whether or not they have a mental illness.
Proposals in a number of states seek to redefine the threshold for involuntary commitment to psychiatric treatment. But in doing so, they have reignited a longstanding debate about the role of forced treatment.
In Ohio, lawmakers are expected to consider a proposal to increase access to outpatient commitment instead of hospitalization, while also doing away with language requiring people with mental illness to show a ''grave and imminent risk to substantial rights'' of themselves or others before they can be committed.
In Colorado, where legislators are undertaking a broad overhaul of the state's mental health system proposed by Gov. John W. Hickenlooper, a Democrat, the proposal also includes changing the criteria for involuntary commitment.
Under the state's current laws, caregivers can place patients on 72-hour mental health holds only if they are believed to pose an ''imminent danger'' to themselves or others. The governor's plan would allow caregivers to commit people if they believe there is a ''substantial probability'' of harm. Virginia and some other states already have standards based on ''substantial probability.''
But some mental health advocates are wary about lowering the threshold. ''The evidence that we have tells us that that's not an appropriate solution, it's not an effective solution to this problem,'' said Jennifer Mathis, deputy legal director at the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, an advocacy group for people with psychiatric disabilities.
But Cheryl Miller -- whose 21-year-old son, Kyle, was shot by the police last June after he pointed a toy gun at them -- believes that a revised law might have saved her child.
Two weeks before Kyle was killed she took him to an emergency mental health clinic to get him hospitalized. But the staff refused to commit him.
''I said, 'I don't want to take him home; he needs to go to the hospital,' '' Ms. Miller said. ''They didn't think so. It goes back to, was he an imminent danger to himself? And it was 'No.' ''

Two More Pakistani Polio Workers Killed

BYLINE: By DECLAN WALSH and ISMAIL KHAN

LENGTH: 436 words

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- A roadside bomb killed two polio workers in northwestern Pakistan on Thursday, in the third such attack this week on workers struggling to immunize children against the crippling disease. 
The explosion struck as the two workers, with a United Nations-backed campaign, were traveling by motorcycle near Parachinar in the Kurram district, near the border with Afghanistan.
It was the first such attack on health workers in that area, said a senior local official speaking by phone on the condition of anonymity, offering further evidence that a Taliban-led campaign of violence and intimidation against polio workers is spreading across northwestern Pakistan.
Despite an internationally supported campaign to halt polio in Pakistan, infection rates have soared across the country in the past year, coinciding with a wave of militant attacks against the poorly protected workers at the heart of the effort. Some militants accuse polio workers of using vaccination campaigns as a cover to spy on behalf of the United States -- a claim that has been fueled by the revelation that the C.I.A. used a vaccination drive as cover for the effort to find Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad in early 2011.
The violence has badly affected vaccination efforts, which involve tens of thousands of health workers who repeatedly administer cheap oral vaccines to children under 5.
Nine polio workers were killed in a string of attacks across the country in December. On Tuesday, people suspected of being militants fatally shot a police officer who had been escorting female polio workers in the Swabi district, 50 miles east of Peshawar, the capital of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province.
The shooting prompted officials to suspend the campaign in Swabi, but they pressed ahead in other parts of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and the adjoining tribal belt. Another polio worker was wounded by a man with an ax in an unrelated episode on Tuesday.
It was unclear, however, whether the latest killings were directly related to the polio campaign. Kurram district has a history of violence between Shiite and Sunni Muslims, and the local official said it was unclear whether the explosion targeted the two workers for their links to the polio campaign or for their religious affiliation.
Violence against polio workers is not confined to the turbulent northwest. United Nations workers in Karachi, the port city on the Arabian Sea, have also suffered attacks that have set back efforts to wipe the disease from the city, Pakistan's most populous.
Pakistan is one of three countries, along with Nigeria and Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic.

Prosecutor Shot to Death In a Town Near Dallas

BYLINE: By LAUREN D'AVOLIO and MANNY FERNANDEZ; Lauren D'Avolio reported from Kaufman, and Manny Fernandez from Houston. Clifford Krauss contributed reporting from Houston.

KAUFMAN, Tex. -- A county prosecutor in this small town southeast of Dallas was fatally shot on Thursday morning near the courthouse by one or perhaps two gunmen, whom witnesses described as wearing masks, black clothing and tactical-style vests, the authorities said. 
The prosecutor, Mark E. Hasse, worked in the Kaufman County district attorney's office in Kaufman, a town of 6,800 people about 35 miles from Dallas. He was shot several times shortly before 9 a.m. as he walked in an employee parking lot about a block from the courthouse.
The authorities said the suspect or suspects got out of a Ford Taurus, opened fire on Mr. Hasse and then returned to the car and drove away. Investigators were trying to determine why Mr. Hasse was targeted and if the shooting had anything to do with cases he had prosecuted.
''I've been doing this 43 years, and I've never seen anything like this,'' said David A. Byrnes, the Kaufman County sheriff.
Mr. Hasse, 57, was the county's lead felony prosecutor and a well-respected assistant district attorney. He received his law degree from Southern Methodist University in Dallas and in the 1980s served as a prosecutor in the Dallas County district attorney's office, where he had been the chief of the organized-crime section.
Kaufman County prosecutors have been involved in investigations of the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas prison gang. In November, federal officials in Houston thanked a number of local agencies for their work -- including Kaufman County prosecutors -- when more than 30 senior leaders and other members of the gang were indicted on federal racketeering charges.
Officials said they were reviewing Mr. Hasse's current cases -- as many as 400 of them -- and previous ones for leads.
Lawyers and prosecutors throughout North Texas were stunned by the attack. The Dallas County district attorney, Craig Watkins, sent an e-mail encouraging his employees to exercise caution.
''There's a lot of shock,'' said David Finn, a criminal defense lawyer in Dallas and former federal prosecutor who knew Mr. Hasse. ''Where this happened, it's not New York City or Dallas or L.A. or Chicago. This is a very, very, very small community, and for this to happen out there, it's a huge deal. It's incredibly brazen.''
The Kaufman County district attorney, Mike McLelland, said his office had suffered a devastating loss. ''Mark was an excellent friend and a spectacular prosecutor,'' he said.
After the shooting, the Kaufman County Courthouse went into lockdown and then was closed as officers and agents from local, state and federal agencies searched the streets nearby.
Area schools, including the campuses of the Kaufman Independent School District, were also placed on lockdown.

Closing Arguments Given in Shaken-Baby Murder Case

BYLINE: By COREY KILGANNON; Jeffrey E. Singer contributed reporting.

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 23

LENGTH: 842 words

After three weeks of disturbing testimony in the trial of a man accused of fatally shaking his 2-month-old daughter in 2007, the defendant's lawyer stood before the jury and began his summation with an oddly sentimental recollection about his own childhood.
The lawyer, Cedric Ashley, told jurors on Thursday that his favorite childhood book was ''The Little Engine That Could,'' and then proceeded to use that steam engine as a metaphor to defend Li Hangbin, who according to the prosecutor in the case, Leigh Bishop, murdered his daughter Annie. 
Mr. Ashley told jurors that Ms. Bishop was driving the ''Prosecution Express'' with Mr. Li, 28, as the ''sole passenger.''
Mr. Li, he said, ''needs protection as they try to drive him to the City of Guilt -- not over the mountain of reasonable doubt, but through the dark tunnel'' where ''the light of justice cannot shine.''
Ms. Bishop began her summation by flipping Mr. Ashley's device, telling the jury, ''We're not here to read a bedtime story.''
''We're here because Annie Li will never read a bedtime story. She'll never read 'The Little Engine That Could.' We're here because Hangbin Li killed Annie Li.''
And so the proceeding in State Supreme Court, in Queens, became a showdown between two lawyers specializing in so-called shaken-baby cases, dueling it out in a closely watched trial. Each skimmed from days of tedious medical testimony -- including hospital records, autopsy reports and varying doctors' opinions -- to sway the jury in two separate directions.
Ms. Bishop used the testimony to try to prove that Mr. Li, a Chinese immigrant who was raising Annie with his companion, Li Ying, 27, was guilty of second-degree murder, among other charges.
On Oct. 22, 2007, Annie fell gravely ill and went into cardiac arrest. She was taken by ambulance to a hospital, where she died five days later, after having sustained what Ms. Bishop called traumatic brain injury.
With his ''Little Engine'' motif, Mr. Ashley seized upon the storybook train's mantra and told jurors that Ms. Bishop's mantra throughout the trial ''was not 'I think I can,' but 'I wish we could.' ''
Throughout his summation, Mr. Ashley kept repeating the ''I wish'' line, mimicking a steam engine as he tried to shoot down Ms. Bishop's explanation that Annie died from ''shaking and blunt force trauma.''
Mr. Ashley told jurors that for a just verdict, ''you can't take the express through the tunnel.'' He added, ''You got to take the local over the mountain of reasonable doubt, to get to the City of Guilt.''
He called the jury ''12 train inspectors,'' and said the only way to save Mr. Li from conviction was to scrutinize the evidence.
The problem, he maintained, was that the proper experts and evidence necessary to rightfully convict Mr. Li were ''not on board'' and that Ms. Bishop built her case on the testimony of ''rock star'' experts flown in like hired guns, and that their testimony was crafty and deceptive.
He urged the jurors to ''hold your hand high and say, 'Stop this train.' ''
Even after dismissing Mr. Ashley's train story, Ms. Bishop took the jury on a narrative ride of her own, starting from the time Annie was alone with Mr. Li on Oct. 22, through her death five days later, and afterward as the medical evidence overwhelmingly showed, she said, that Annie had symptoms consistent with traumatic brain injury.
She was ''viciously and brutally extinguished at the hands of her own father,'' Ms. Bishop said. She told jurors that Mr. Li first told doctors at the hospital that the baby suffered a bump, but then after a CT scan revealed serious injuries, he later revised his description as a ''heavy bump.''
''Does a loving father really need 36 hours and a CT scan to prompt his memory?'' Ms. Bishop said.
Children, she said, ''don't just wind up in a pediatric care unit, dying from a bump on the head.''
Ms. Bishop called Mr. Li a man who ''chose his own well-being -- he chose himself -- over his daughter,'' and she reminded jurors that Mr. Li held Annie as she died. ''He stared down at his little girl as she leaves our world, and even that could not pierce the defendant's desire to protect himself,'' she said.
Mr. Li watched both summations intently, a court official at his elbow translating the proceedings into his ear. If convicted, Mr. Li would face a maximum sentence of 25 years to life.
Mr. Ashley maintains that Annie, whose health was already fragile because of a genetic condition, was bumped against a night table during a chaotic revival process after her heart attack. All of these factors contributed to her falling unconscious and eventually dying, Mr. Ashley said.
Ms. Bishop mocked this as ''a perfect storm for a number of rare medical conditions'' and ''a preposterous chain of events.''
Three weeks ago, Ms. Bishop opened her case by asking the jury, ''What happened to baby Annie Li?'' Just before Justice Richard L. Buchter charged the jury on Thursday, Ms. Bishop said one final thing to the jurors.

Some Sheriffs Object to Call for Tougher Gun Laws

DENVER -- The same day that President Obama unveiled his plan to address gun violence, the sheriff of Larimer County, Justin Smith, took to his personal Facebook page.
In an impassioned post, Sheriff Smith, whose jurisdiction includes a swath of suburbia and farmland north of Denver, railed against universal background checks and wrote of the need to defend the Second Amendment.
''As Sheriff, I will not enforce unconstitutional federal laws,'' he wrote. 
Over the past several weeks, dozens of other sheriffs from across the country have reacted with similar public opposition to Mr. Obama's call for stiffer gun laws, releasing a deluge of letters, position papers and statements laying out their arguments in stark terms. Their jurisdictions largely include rural areas, and stand in sharp contrast to those of urban police chiefs, who have historically supported tougher gun regulations.
''I don't plan on helping or assisting with any of the federal gun laws because I have the U.S. Supreme Court and the U.S. Constitution on my side,'' said Sheriff John Cooke of Weld County, Colo. Sheriff Cooke said that he believed a ban on assault weapons would do little and that universal background checks would unfairly halt private gun sales.
''Let the federal government do their own dirty work,'' he added.
Last week the County Sheriffs of Colorado, which represents the state's 64 sheriffs, released a position paper expressing the group's opposition to gun regulation -- including bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and the mandate of a statewide database for concealed carry permit holders. The group said it was more important to focus on improving mental health care to prevent mass shootings.
The Utah Sheriffs' Association outlined an even stronger sentiment in a recent letter to Mr. Obama stating that no federal official would be permitted to take away its constituents' Second Amendment rights.
The sheriffs said they were ''prepared to trade our lives'' to preserve a traditional interpretation of the Constitution.
Sheriffs across a range of counties in Arizona, Kentucky, Oregon and other states have also weighed in publicly, suggesting they, too, would refuse to enforce gun laws they felt violated the Second Amendment.
Last week in Wisconsin, Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. of Milwaukee County released a public service announcement urging citizens to arm themselves, saying that waiting for the police was no longer the best option.
''You can beg for mercy from a violent criminal, hide under the bed or you can fight back,'' Sheriff Clarke said in the recording.
The fervent opposition to gun control has caught the National Sheriffs' Association, the primary industry group for more than 3,000 sheriffs, off guard.
This week, the group met to clarify its own stance on new gun proposals, which a spokesman said it would release Friday.
''What you really have is a lot of citizens with a lot of mistrust of the government's efforts regarding firearms,'' said its president, Sheriff Larry Amerson of Calhoun County, Ala. ''They don't feel safe, and the sheriffs are reacting to that.''
He added: ''But I will tell you that there is a mix. I have talked to sheriffs who say they don't have a problem with passing a gun ban of any particular type.''
Sheriff Amerson noted that unlike police chiefs, sheriffs were almost all elected officials and had to answer to their constituents. They were also more likely to work in rural areas, he said, where opposition to new gun regulations was stronger.
Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, which generally supports changes in gun laws, said that because sheriffs are often in charge of local jails and deal with mentally ill inmates, they were also more likely to view mental health as the most pressing concern.
Mr. Wexler, whose group researches law enforcement issues in major cities, said urban police chiefs had long been more receptive to gun control measures because they handled gun crime on an everyday basis.
''What sheriffs see, in terms of gun violence, is not necessarily what police chiefs in Philadelphia or Chicago or a more suburban place like Aurora see,'' he said. ''Their constituents tend to see gun crime differently as well.''

Arizona: Man Suspected in Shooting Is Found Dead

PHOENIX -- A man who opened fire at an office complex here was found dead on Thursday from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in the nearby city of Mesa, the police said. One of his victims, a lawyer, was placed on life support and ''will not survive,'' according to a statement from the firm where he worked. 
A landscaper found the body of the gunman, Arthur Harmon, before 8 a.m., said Sgt. Tommy Thompson, a spokesman for the Phoenix Police Department. A rented Kia Optima, his getaway car, was parked nearby.
On Wednesday, Mr. Harmon, 70, killed a businessman, Steven Singer, 48, whose company he had sued, and critically injured the lawyer, Mark Hummels, 43, who was representing Mr. Singer. Nichole Hampton, 32, who came upon the shooting as she was leaving the building, was shot in the hand.
The shooting happened as the three men left a mediation session to resolve their dispute, over payment for furniture repair services that Mr. Harmon had provided at a call center Mr. Singer owned in California. Sergeant Thompson said that the shooting was ''not random,'' and that Mr. Singer and Mr. Hummels were Mr. Harmon's targets.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Oregon Man Convicted In Holiday Bombing Plot

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 19

LENGTH: 656 words

PORTLAND, Ore. -- A 21-year-old Somali-American arrested here in late 2010 after pushing a cellphone button to trigger what he believed was a huge car bomb -- in fact an elaborate and inert F.B.I. decoy device -- was convicted on Thursday in Federal District Court of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction. He faces up to life in prison.
The jury, deliberating for one day, rejected the assertion by the defendant, Mohamed Osman Mohamud, that he had been entrapped and induced into a terrorist act by F.B.I. agents posing as radical Islamic militants. His lawyers argued that the undercover operatives, having invested major resources and time into the case, manipulated Mr. Mohamud into a plot he would never have undertaken on his own. 
''We're disappointed,'' said Stephen R. Sady, Mr. Mohamud's lead lawyer, who said the verdict would be appealed. ''We obviously thought he was entrapped.''
Mr. Sady said he hoped that Senior Judge Garr M. King, who set sentencing for May 14, would consider mitigating evidence that came out in the trial. Mr. Mohamud showed little obvious emotion as the verdict was read by Judge King or as he was led from the courtroom, where the sound of shackles applied to his wrists could be heard.
Amanda Marshall, the United States attorney for Oregon, said in a news conference after the verdict, ''We are hopeful that this will bring closure and healing to all of us here in Portland.'' She said the case had raised strong feelings on both sides, and among local Somalis. ''It's complicated; it hasn't been easy,'' she said.
The case gripped Oregon and seized national attention in November 2010, partly through a glimpse of undercover policing of terrorism in the sting operation that ensnared Mr. Mohamud. Perhaps even more, it was because of the setting: a Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Pioneer Courthouse Square, Portland's premier open-space oasis, packed on the night of the attack with about 25,000 people.
What had loomed large and global at the time -- with its hints of international terrorist intrigue -- ultimately became, through the two weeks of testimony, a smaller, more intimate story of psychology. The jury, in assessing hours of secretly recorded conversations and evidence of what seemed a typical college student's life at Oregon State University, was asked to decide whether the thin young man sitting with lawyers was a romantic, hate-filled fantasist who just wanted to strike a pose, or a genuine jihadist nipped in the bud before violence could be done.
Whether Portland was ever actually threatened became part of the debate at the trial.
Undercover F.B.I. agents testifying for the prosecution said that they feared Mr. Mohamud could have connected with real terrorists and bombmakers had they not intervened with a sting operation. Mr. Mohamud's lawyers, by contrast, argued that the case was all about the character of a callow, immature young man. They called witnesses, including friends and family members of the defendant who called him goofy and fun-loving, and a threat-assessment expert who said that the bellicose bluster about radical Islam -- in articles, journal entries and comments recorded by the F.B.I. -- was nothing more than adolescent chest-thumping.
''This case is a tragedy,'' Mr. Sady said in his summation to the jury on Wednesday.
Portland residents interviewed on Thursday in the square where the attack was to have occurred mostly said they had paid little attention to a trial about what might have been.
''Guns are more of a concern to me,'' said Dana Odling, a retired food service worker for the federal Department of Veterans Affairs. She said that especially since the shootings in Newtown, Conn., and at a shopping mall just outside Portland -- both in December -- she had been much more conscious of the potential mayhem that one person with a store-bought weapon could create. ''Something like that can happen anytime, anywhere,'' she said.

Our quirky, discerning picks for the most interesting things to do around the state this week.
HOUSTON
Warred Out
Recent gun violence in the United States has distracted from the drug war in Mexico and on the border. But in ''Crףnicas,'' the new exhibition at FotoFest, seven photographers, filmmakers and printmakers whose families deal with the violence on a daily basis take the public eye back to that brutal landscape.
''It's an alternative to what the mass media is putting out there,'' said Jennifer Ward, the show's curator. ''There was recently a story about 12 bodies being found in a car. And that's all we heard about. There were no names to the bodies, no families, nothing behind it. With this show, we are adding some humanity to it.'' 
Edgardo Aragףn, from Oaxaca, has made a series of 13 short films, ''Family Effects,'' in which his young nephews and nieces re-enact stories about his family's real-life involvement with the drug cartel.
Pedro Reyes, from Culiacבn, will display shovels he shaped out of the melted metal in the 1,500 guns he collected through a buyback program and uses for planting trees. (He will plant one in Guadalupe Plaza Park on March 23.)
And Miguel Aragףn, from Ciudad Juבrez, has a piece called ''Retrato No. 4,'' a newspaper photo of a decapitated head that he treated to create a ''ghostly, ashy'' look.
''You don't turn away,'' Ms. Ward said. ''You look deeper into the photograph.''
FotoFest, Feb. 1-March 9,

LUBBOCK
Hey, Buddy
The day Buddy Holly died in a plane crash with Ritchie Valens and the Big Bopper (J. P. Richardson, from Sabine Pass) is, per Don McLean's song ''American Pie,'' the day the music died. But really it had the opposite effect.
In response to the loss of those rock 'n' roll pioneers on Feb. 3, 1959, scores of teenagers picked up guitars. Countless events commemorate this date, including Winter Dance Party revivals that trace Holly and his musical colleagues' fateful tour.
But a pilgrimage to the Buddy Holly Center for its 54th-anniversary celebration, which consists of three exhibitions and a guitar workshop, offers the deepest look at Holly's legacy.
He honed his craft alongside Roy Orbison and Elvis Presley and like Bob Dylan, once had a girlfriend named Echo. You can read about her in one of Holly's journals, which is on display.
Buddy Holly Center, Feb. 3, 1 p.m., buddyhollycenter.org
AUSTIN
The Sound of Saveur
A problem with the popular concept of pairing music with food to create a multisensory experience is that the music tends to be largely unfamiliar, often classical. A solution is L'Oca d'Oro, the new Austin supper club started by Fiore Tedesco III, the former musician who now works at Franklin Barbecue.
For his first series of suppers, ''Dinners to Rock To,'' Mr. Tedesco is preparing four five-course meals paired with albums by the Pixies, Metallica, Fleetwood Mac and the Stooges.
Mr. Tedesco, though secretive about the menus, revealed that for opening night with the Pixies, the cuisine would be South and Central American fare with a Spanish twist, perhaps a reference to the time Black Francis, the Pixies' frontman, spent in Puerto Rico, which comes through in his many Spanish lyrics.
Mr. Tedesco also said there would be octopus.
Franklin Barbecue, Feb. 3, 6:30 p.m. and 9 p.m., locadoroaustin .com
FREDERICKSBURG
Ashes to Ashes
The pre-Lenten gorge that we call Mardi Gras has many names. Cities all over the world celebrate Roman Catholicism with similar Fat Tuesday decadence before Ash Wednesday temperance.
Fasching Fredericksburg is the Hill Country's take on the German version, offering three opportunities to lose your religion before finding it again.
The first is at Fest Nacht, a B.Y.O.B. rock 'n' roll costume party. The next is the Fasching Ball, a masquerade recreating Berlin in the Roaring Twenties, complete with vodka fountain. And then there is the one everyone knows about, Fat Tuesday, with live zydeco music and a crawfish and shrimp boil.
Various locations, Feb. 2 & 9 at 7 p.m. and Feb. 12 at 4 p.m., faschingfredericksburg.com
GALVESTON
Shake It All About
Mardi Gras Galveston is arguably second only to Mardi Gras in New Orleans, but where Galveston is No. 1 is in its umbrella dance, the second-line dancing to the hokeypokey with raised umbrellas, and this year the city is trying to beat its Guinness record of 1,516 participants.
Downtown, Feb. 1-12, mardigrasgalveston.com
HOUSTON
Body and Soul
Most of the jazz and blues musicians who made the Eldorado Ballroom famous are gone, but you can still see some of them in all their sweaty glory at the Eldorado, the Third Ward black social club known for its dance-floor action during its mid-20th-century heyday, at Soul Nite, with vintage film from shows by the likes of Ray Charles and Etta James.

As Arab Spring's Glow Fades and Turmoil Rises, Unsettling Questions

BYLINE: By ANNE BARNARD; Hwaida Saad contributed reporting from Beirut.

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; MEMO FROM BEIRUT; Pg. 12

LENGTH: 1196 words

BEIRUT, Lebanon -- The scenes of chaos came in swift succession over the past week.
In Egypt, angry crowds overran police stations and killed officers. In northern Syria, more than 90 bodies were pulled from a river, many bound and shot. Israeli warplanes struck Syria on Wednesday after Israeli officials expressed concern that Syrian weapons would fall into the hands of militants -- an attack that fueled fears of escalating regional conflict.
Two years after largely peaceful uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt toppled dictators, unleashing hope and instability across the Arab world, the transformation of the region's long-calcified political systems has taken a violent turn in many quarters, raising unsettling questions: Was this postrevolutionary tumult inevitable, a product of missteps by local leaders and foreign powers, or perhaps a bit of both?
With Syria mired in a bloody civil war and Arab newspapers debating whether Egypt's new government will disintegrate or be taken over by the military, the most important players -- ordinary citizens trying to seize a long-denied say in their destinies -- are uncertain how long they will live in a state of upheaval, and what their lives will be like when things finally settle down. 
''The revolution is like a baby,'' Rami, a Syrian activist, said in an interview on Sunday in a Beirut cafe. ''You can't say if this baby is going to be a doctor or a lawyer, smart or dumb. Even if this baby throws his mother's purse, I can't complain -- he's a baby.''
Rami, who asked that his last name not be used for safety reasons, said he expected the revolution to include wrong turns.
''In revolution we destroy, we build,'' he said. ''Sometimes we get a distorted shape which will automatically be torn down.''
In Tunisia and Egypt, citizens deposed presidents largely by flooding the streets, but in Syria, at least 60,000 people have died in a violent struggle that has deepened sectarian animosities and has yet to topple the government. In Egypt, hopes for power sharing have been dashed as President Mohamed Morsi rammed through a new constitution and did not overhaul the security services. The country appears trapped in a spiral of street protests, random violence, economic stagnation and political paralysis.
But Middle East analysts and scholars of revolutions say that it would be naןve to expect smooth transitions in countries where political debate was repressed for decades, and that political change will be slow, messy and often violent.
At the same time, the analysts say, it is impossible to draw broad conclusions about the Arab uprisings, which are still young and are taking place in very different countries -- Libya, with six million people and vast oil reserves, Egypt with more than 80 million people and few natural resources. In each, the incentives of local players and foreign meddlers vary widely.
''We have leapt to the conclusion that all the transitions should be smooth,'' said Jon B. Alterman, director of the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ''That's pretty ahistoric.''
The American Revolution eventually produced a stable system, but the Constitution did not take effect until 13 years after the Declaration of Independence, and the effects of upheavals like the Whiskey Rebellion and repressive measures like the Alien and Sedition Acts played out into the 19th century.
Whether a transition is going well is ''often impossible to judge at the time,'' Mr. Alterman added. ''The Arab world's transitions are a process that will take at least a decade to unfold.''
The countries in transition have few political institutions, after decades of repression. Political debates that usually unfold over decades are being compressed into lightning transitions.
''You're moving from one-man or one-military rule to the masses,'' said Joyce Karam, the Washington bureau chief of the newspaper Al Hayat, a pan-Arab publication based in London.
With few parties or charismatic leaders to shape people's broad aspirations for a better life into a political strategy, Arab societies in transition are vulnerable to the resurgence of entrenched interests, and to outside manipulation. Saudi Arabia and other Gulf monarchies, for instance, fear that smooth transitions could embolden their people to rise up. Their public and private support for various competing rebel factions may also prolong instability, Mr. Alterman said.
The Arab uprisings have been interconnected, as movements inspire and instruct one another, and have reawakened a sense of regional identity and common purpose for a generation too young to remember the heyday of Arab nationalism.
But activists tend to see events in their own countries as sui generis, driven by the mix of domestic politics and foreign interests affecting their country rather than a uniform regional narrative -- and to reject suggestions that the Arab uprisings as a whole are a threat, or a failure.
''It's tough to generalize,'' Ms. Karam said, contending that although they all have their problems, Libya, Tunisia, Egypt and in some ways even Yemen, where the state structure, unstable as it was, remained intact after the president stepped down, offer ''less chaotic models than Syria.''
The Western powers that initially welcomed democracy movements increasingly appear more concerned with containing instability than with promoting democracy, Ms. Karam said.
The United States and its allies continue to hesitate over arming Syrian rebels for fear of empowering extremists among them, while France bombarded Mali last month, targeting militants linked to Al Qaeda, and the United States signaled its willingness to help. France, like the United States, has refused to intervene directly in Syria. That Western powers were quicker to intervene in Mali than against Mr. Assad, who has used ballistic missiles against his own people, particularly angers Syrians, who have begged in vain for the kind of assistance that helped rebels prevail in Libya.
''It reinforces the image that Washington and the West are not interested in democracy and human rights in the region, that they won't intervene unless there is Al Qaeda or oil,'' Ms. Karam said.
Turmoil, failure and unintended outcomes are hardly unique to Arab revolutions.
Iran's overthrow of the shah in 1979 began as a people's revolution, but impotent new leaders lost a power struggle with the theocratic founders of the Islamic republic. Many revolts in the 1960s across the developing world replaced colonial tyranny with local tyranny.
The collapse of the Soviet Union is perhaps the best recent parallel, as a stagnant order gave way to a multitude of new systems.
For the people caught in the middle, the fear is undeniable. In Egypt, no one seems able to control the streets, and for the first time, guns are appearing in the hands of protesters. Syrian refugees pouring into Lebanon say that regardless of the war's outcome, they will have to rebuild their lives from scratch.
But one, Abu Shadi, said there was no going back.
''If Assad falls, we will suffer for a couple of years,'' he said, ''but things will improve. But if he stays, we suffer forever.''

It'll Be a Mixed Marriage: Just One of Them Is Alive

BYLINE: By MANOHLA DARGIS

SECTION: Section C; Column 0; Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk; MOVIE REVIEW; Pg. 9

LENGTH: 746 words

The zombie romance ''Warm Bodies'' is cute and amusing enough to catch on cable one day, where its star-crossed, blood-drenched lovers will eventually present sweet relief from the apocalyptic freakout that is the AMC series ''The Walking Dead.'' If ''The Walking Dead'' is ''Lost'' with zombies and a high kill rate, ''Warm Bodies'' is effectively a riff on every teenage romance ever told, from Ovid's Pyramus and Thisbe on. Boy or, in this case, zombie meets girl. Zombie loses girl. Zombie -- well, you know the rest, though here the familiar balance comes with human tartare, screams and the unsettling image of John Malkovich as the leader of the seemingly last people on Earth. 
Written and directed by Jonathan Levine (''50/50''), ''Warm Bodies'' is an improbable romance sweetened with appealing performances and buoyed by one of the better cute meets in recent romantic comedy, when the zombie boy, R (Nicholas Hoult), decides not to eat a live girl, Julie (Teresa Palmer). And she looks so tasty too, a Kristen Stewart type with less fidgeting and a sense of self-preservation. (She's out scouting, looking for something nonhuman to eat.) Smitten or stricken, R drops everything -- in this case, a half-gnawed corpse -- and stares into her eyes, where intelligence battles fear. He then smears blood on her face to fool his zombie brethren (Rob Corddry included) into thinking that she's dead, grunts a few sweet nothings and shuffles off, taking her to his lair.
Freud described the oral stage of early psychosexual development as ''cannibalistic pregenital sexual organization.'' In this stage, he elaborated, ''sexual activity has not yet been separated from the ingestion of food.'' In order for there to be a story R must learn to keep his monstrous appetite in check so that he can be with Julie and not just consume her. He learns, in other words, to separate sexual activity from gobbling brains. (Real Freudians should feel free to parse how this zombie boy handles the other stages.) In story terms that means R hangs out with Julie inside the jet that he has turned into his dead-man cave and in which they listen to his vinyl records. They sound, he explains, alive.
''Warm Bodies'' began as a short story, ''I Am a Zombie Filled With Love,'' that its author, Isaac Marion, expanded into a novel, also titled ''Warm Bodies,'' which earned praise from Stephenie Meyer (the author of the ''Twilight'' books) and led, inevitably, to a movie deal. Given that Summit Entertainment, the company releasing ''Warm Bodies,'' also turned Ms. Meyer's ''Twilight'' books into a global screen phenomenon, it seems it has decided that romances between sort of dead boys and living girls is a niche it can fill. The resurrection of the vampire as the ultimate suave lover has its understandable appeal. A boy-man like Edward in the ''Twilight'' series may be dead, but he has old-fashioned manners and, unlike his flesh-and-blood contemporaries, is in control of his hunger.
R is less obviously appealing than Edward, both less worldly and courtly, yet also more recognizable. R keeps his hunger in check without much struggle, a process that's personalized through his voice-over and in talky passages that show Mr. Levine's ability to sustain interest with just two people in a room. (Dave Franco and Analeigh Tipton help round out the cast.) The off-the-shelf action scenes mostly involve someone, dead or alive, chasing someone else, who's dead or alive, including armies of cheap-looking digital ghouls. Like the story, these scenes are familiar if not deadly, despite the nuance-killing music. If the movie surmounts its genericism, it's largely because of the actors and a love in which the monstrous has been made literal, and violent delights don't necessarily lead to violent ends.
''Warm Bodies'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Gun violence and mild zombie chomping.

Bad, Badder and Baddest

BYLINE: By MANOHLA DARGIS

LENGTH: 785 words

The multiple bullets that pierce multiple brains in ''Bullet to the Head'' -- boring holes into people as disposable as paper gun targets -- suggest that the title refers to an ideal rather than being merely descriptive. It implies, in other words, an appreciation and awareness of the principles of contemporary action cinema, and perhaps even a sense of play in respect to the genre. And while the veteran action director Walter Hill hasn't done much to enliven this dull, unmemorable material, with its mechanically moving parts and popping gunfire, its dull-red splatter and spray, he has brought a spark of wit to the proceedings, starting with the figure of Sylvester Stallone. 
Mr. Stallone is the draw here, along with Mr. Hill, whose credits include ''The Driver,'' ''The Warriors'' and ''48 Hrs.'' Needless to say, both men have seen better days and certainly better screenplays. This one, written by Alessandro Camon, is based on a French graphic novel, ''Du Plomb Dans la Tךte,'' which was written by Matz (a k a Alexis Nolent) and illustrated by Colin Wilson and whose title roughly, somewhat amusingly, translates as ''Lead in the Head.'' The story involves the usual collection of bad, badder and baddest men shooting and sometimes slugging it out in a New Orleans so anonymous it might as well be a studio back lot. Some men die and some men live, though, frankly, there isn't all that much distinguishing the quick from the dead.
As Jimmy Bobo, a contract killer who lives in a tough-guy stronghold on the water (the association between him and swamp creatures seems intentional), Mr. Stallone doesn't so much play a character as wear the mask of the ethically, legally and grammatically challenged loner. Short on long talk, Bobo spits out words like nails (''I got some rules'') and uses a gun to pound in his meaning. One advantage of such taciturn brutalism is that there's no need to second-guess him: he does what he promises, as when he tells someone, ''I'm going to kill you.'' There's an absurdly comic purity to lines like this that suggest that the filmmakers, having already ignored little details like complex characters and psychological motivations, decided to whittle the whole thing down to its generic core.
Like a diminished Atlas, the lean-looking Mr. Stallone shoulders the weight of that core shakily but determinedly. Although he shares the burden with co-stars like Jon Seda and Jason Momoa, the movie most probably owes its existence to Mr. Stallone and the movie history he hauls along with him. He seems more totem than man these days, which partly has to do with the flickering specters of Rocky and Rambo but also with the ravages of age and other assaults. To look at the cubistic arrangement that constitutes Mr. Stallone's face and to witness his fairly restricted physical performance -- he apparently fractured his neck a few years ago and now barely seems able to turn his head -- is to gaze upon a god at twilight. He is at once unearthly and more poignantly human than he has been in years.
The movie is nonetheless pretty bad, and there's some especially awful razzing between Bobo and his odd-couple partner, an out-of-town cop, Taylor Kwon (Sung Kang). Much of this involves would-be cutting comments about Kwon's heritage (hence the idiotic references to Bruce Lee, kung fu and the like), which suggest that someone was trying to replicate the banter from ''48 Hrs.,'' one of Mr. Hill's best films. The exchanges fall flat, as does so much here, including a little family filler with Bobo's daughter (Sarah Shahi, one of the token women) and some all-purpose intrigue with a couple of suits (Christian Slater and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje). No one here seems to notice that there's not much going on, including Mr. Stallone, which somehow makes it easier to watch.
''Bullet to the Head'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Extreme gun and ax violence.

The King of New York

NEW HAVEN
I WAS almost scripted to hate Ed Koch from the moment in September 1977 when I moved, with a new Harvard doctorate, to Brooklyn, on what would become a long activist-writer's foray into the city's fiscal crisis and the effects of that summer's power blackout and looting.
Mr. Koch was winning the Democratic mayoral primary, and my cousin James Wechsler, who'd been the editor of The New York Post in its liberal glory days but was then in charge of just the editorial page, was shaking his head in a lonely corner office on South Street as The Post's new proprietor, Rupert Murdoch, turned it into a virtual press office for the Koch campaign. 
Throughout his 12 years as mayor I assailed Mr. Koch -- in a Brooklyn newspaper that I edited, in Dissent, in The Village Voice and even while working across the hall from him as a speechwriter for the City Council president, Carol Bellamy, whom the mayor at one point denominated, with his customary grace, ''a horror show.''
Somehow, 20 years after his first mayoral victory, I'd become an occasional Saturday lunch partner for Mr. Koch. As I listened to him hold court, I felt a bit like the man who reflects, ''When I was 20, I couldn't believe how stupid my father was; now that I'm 40, I'm impressed by how much he's learned in those 20 years.''
I don't mean that Ed Koch was right about the fiscal and racial challenges he confronted -- I think he was often clueless and wrong -- but that even when wrong, he was brave and earnest in ways I hadn't at first comprehended.
One of his most emblematic, contradictory comments came in a Brooklyn ''town meeting'' in the early 1980s, where I watched him field questions from politically conservative, white ethnic and Jewish constituents. A man complained about new hiring standards to increase female and Hispanic representation in the police department: ''Mr. Koch, why do you lower the height requirements just to include them? We need policemen who are big and tall and command respect.''
The speaker was barely finished before the mayor raised his eyebrows in mock astonishment. ''Have you ever seen a 5-foot-4 Puerto Rican with a gun?'' The audience roared; his aides winced. Happily for them, no big media were present, sparing liberal New Yorkers the spectacle of a mayor using racism to defend affirmative action.
On such paradoxes was Ed Koch's mayoralty built. By showing frightened ''outer borough'' ethnics that he shared their visceral understandings, he won their grudging acquiescence in what, despite his rhetoric, was a liberal and racially integrated administration.
Unfortunately, too much of that rhetoric provided cover for aggressive austerity measures, steps that he had to take to save the city but didn't have to embrace quite as exuberantly as he did.
Yet one quintessentially ''Koch'' gesture along those lines impresses me more favorably in retrospect than it did at the time.
As Mr. Koch rose to address the American Public Health Association at the New York Hilton in 1979, doctors and health care activists protesting the closing of municipal hospitals, including Harlem's symbolically important Sydenham, chanted ''Racist Koch, you can't hide; we charge you with genocide!'' Three stormed the stage, pelting him with eggs. As his face streamed with the goo, Mr. Koch, then 54 years old, wrestled one to the floor before security guards carried the man off.
Mr. Koch then called on audience members to stand if they wanted the other hecklers removed. As three-quarters of them did, he shouted, in his familiar, high-pitched scream: ''If you can't get your way out of the ballot box, you're not going to get it through force! This is not Iran!''
It looked demagogic. But not so much now, with Tea Party heckling and assaults on public officials. I don't doubt he'd have dealt similarly with them -- all the more so because he recently admitted that closing Sydenham was one of his big mistakes.
''You've come a long way,'' Mr. Koch wrote me in 1994, after reading a column of mine. I wish I could say he'd come a long way, too. But his courage, candor, principle and almost wild love for New York didn't trump the fears and enthusiasms that marred his judgment. One of his last public political acts, his successful appeal to Jewish voters in Queens to elect a Republican congressional candidate to send the Obama administration a message about its policies toward Israel, strengthened a House majority perverted by people who would assail him as furiously as leftist activists did in 1979.
I can almost hear him saying, ''Of course, I'd have wrestled them down, too!'' His belligerence was his strength, but also his tragic flaw: he rallied a city in crisis, but he couldn't redeem it -- or himself.

Rosa Parks, Revisited

BYLINE: By CHARLES M. BLOW. 
Gail Collins is off today.

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; OP-ED COLUMNIST; Pg. 23

LENGTH: 776 words

Most of what you think you know about Rosa Parks may well be wrong.
On the verge of the 100th anniversary of her birth this Monday comes a fascinating new book, ''The Rebellious Life of Mrs. Rosa Parks,'' by Jeanne Theoharis, a Brooklyn College professor. It argues that the romanticized, children's-book story of a meek seamstress with aching feet who just happened into history in a moment of uncalculated resistance is pure mythology.
As Theoharis points out, ''Rosa's family sought to teach her a controlled anger, a survival strategy that balanced compliance with militancy.'' 
Parks was mostly raised by her grandparents. Her grandfather, a follower of Marcus Garvey, often sat vigil on the porch with a rifle in case the Klan came. She sometimes sat with him because, as the book says she put it, ''I wanted to see him kill a Ku Kluxer.''
When she was a child, a young white man taunted her. In turn, she threatened him with a brick. Her grandmother reprimanded her as ''too high-strung,'' warning that Rosa would be lynched before the age of 20. Rosa responded, ''I would be lynched rather than be run over by them.''
One of the most troubling and possibly most controversial scenes in the book occurs when Rosa is a young woman working as a domestic. A white man whom she calls ''Mr. Charlie'' tries to sexually assault her. Determined to protect herself, she taunts him as she evades him, haranguing him about the ''white man's inhuman treatment of the Negro.''
''How I hated all white people, especially him,'' she continued. ''I said I would never stoop so low as to have anything to do with him.''
Parks added that ''if he wanted to kill me and rape a dead body, he was welcome but he would have to kill me first.''
The author points out that although the story is recorded in Parks's own handwriting, it isn't clear whether it's completely true, half true or just allegory.
Rosa married Raymond Parks, a civil rights activist who sometimes carried a gun and who impressed her because, she said, ''he refused to be intimidated by white people.''
She spent nearly two decades before the bus incident struggling, organizing and agitating for civil rights, mostly as the secretary of the Montgomery, Ala., branch of the N.A.A.C.P. But it wasn't until Parks was in her 40s and attended an integrated workshop that she found ''for the first time in my adult life that this could be a unified society.'' This didn't mean that she was eager for integration, though. She was later quoted as saying that what people sought ''was not a matter of close physical contact with whites, but equal opportunity.''
And Parks was by no means the first person to perform an act of civil disobedience on a bus. She was very much aware of many of the people whose similar actions had preceded her own, even raising money for some of their defense funds. She also encouraged others to commit these acts of civil disobedience.
Parks explained that ''I had felt for a long time, that if I was ever told to get up so a white person could sit, that I would refuse to do so.''
That day came on Dec. 1, 1955, when a bus driver asked her to get up so that a white man could sit. She refused. This was not a spur-of-the-moment decision. It was a political calculation informed by a life of activism. As Parks put it, ''an opportunity was being given to me to do what I had asked of others.''
And the idea that she stayed seated because of physical fatigue is pure fiction.
''I didn't tell anyone my feet were hurting,'' the book quotes her as saying. ''It was just popular, I suppose because they wanted to give some excuse other than the fact that I didn't want to be pushed around.''
The book also lays out Parks's leading role in the bus boycotts and her decades of activism after the civil rights movement.
When Parks died in 2005, Theoharis says, ''The Rosa Parks who surfaced in the deluge of public commentary was, in nearly every account, characterized as 'quiet.' 'Humble,' 'dignified,' and 'soft-spoken,' she was 'not angry' and 'never raised her voice.' ''
Parks, like many other Americans who over the years have angrily agitated for change in this country, had been sanitized and sugarcoated for easy consumption.
As Theoharis writes: ''Held up as a national heroine but stripped of her lifelong history of activism and anger at American injustice, the Parks who emerged was a self-sacrificing mother figure for a nation who would use her death for a ritual of national redemption.''
Fortunately, this book seeks to restore Parks's wholeness, even at the risk of stirring unease.
The Rosa Parks in this book is as much Malcolm X as she is Martin Luther King Jr.
Happy Black History Month.

An article on Thursday about a hearing in Newtown, Conn., on Wednesday about gun control referred incorrectly to a previous meeting of the state's Task Force on Gun Violence Prevention and Children's Safety. Its first public hearing was on Jan. 25, not on Monday. And a picture caption misspelled, in some copies, the given name and the surname of a woman who spoke at the hearing and whose son Jesse was killed in the school massacre there. She is Scarlett Lewis, not Scarlet Louis. The caption repeated the misspelled surname in referring to Jesse.

To Thwart a Powerful Intruder, He Let Him Open the Door

The young man was strong, but the intruder was stronger. The man was inside his apartment, pulling at the doorknob, trying to close the door, but the intruder in the hall had gripped it with both hands and jammed a leg against the wall for leverage. The door was opening, inch by inch.
This is when the young man had, arguably, his first good idea in the last several long, bad minutes. 
It had been well past midnight the morning of Jan. 16, and the man, a 23-year-old film editor who asked that his name be withheld, left a bar near City Hall and, in high spirits, decided to walk home in a downpour. He had an iPhone in his pocket, but he kept it there, as he did not want to get it wet.
The young man arrived at his family's apartment building on Spring Street, unlocked the front door and opened a second one before he realized someone else had pushed in behind him.
The film editor was hardly a newcomer, as so many tenants his age in the SoHo neighborhood were. His parents had lived here since the early 1970s, among artists and lofts, and criminals who kept the neighborhood on the fringe for years. Their son grew up here. But the habit of looking over one's shoulder before entering a building had fallen away over time.
The editor walked to the elevator. The intruder, a bigger man in a ball cap and hood, came up behind him and pulled a pistol partway out of his coat pocket. He said, ''Let's make this real simple.''
The elevator door opened, and both men entered. The intruder told the editor to give him all his money. The editor opened his wallet and handed over about $35. The intruder frisked him and found a couple more singles in a pocket. ''He got so upset,'' the editor recalled this week. ''His eyes were twitching and completely bloodshot.''
The intruder -- now a robber -- also found the iPhone. He asked, ''Is this a 4, or a 4S?'' the editor recalled. It was a 4S. He took it. He took the wallet, too, and rifled through it, taking two MetroCards.
The editor realized he was holding half a sandwich from Subway. ''Do you want my Subway sandwich?'' he asked, getting a little cheeky. No, the man said, give or take an expletive, I do not want your Subway sandwich.
The editor must have pressed the button for the second floor, where he lived, but he doesn't remember doing so. The doors had opened and closed once during the robbery, and they opened again.
Do you live alone? the robber asked. Yes, the editor lied, thinking of his sleeping parents.
The editor squeezed past and moved quickly to his apartment door, but before he could get inside and pull it shut behind him, the robber had clamped his hands on the door and was pulling, hard. ''I was slowly losing the battle,'' the editor said.
That is when he had his good idea. Instead of pulling, he let go and slammed his shoulder into the door. The surprising blow pushed the robber, already leaning hard in that direction, away against a far wall. The editor quickly closed and locked the door.
His father awakened and they called the police, who collected high-quality pictures from a surveillance camera. The suspect, it turned out, had hailed a cab eight seconds before they had arrived.
But he did not stay away for long. The next day, officers spotted the suspect nearby in the Prince Street subway station and arrested him, Detective Raul Delpozo said. The police identified him as Anthony Roman, 28, and said he had been busy in the neighborhood for a month, robbing five other people. He started small, stealing $25 and Chinese food from a victim in the West Village on Dec. 17, the police said, but three days later forced a victim to withdraw $200 from an A.T.M.
''This is your unlucky day,'' he told a victim on Jan. 9, taking a cellphone, iPod and cash, the police said.
His gun, it turned out, was a toy that looked real, Detective Delpozo said.
The editor was called to the precinct station house to look at a lineup. He sat in a crowded waiting room, the Knicks game playing on a television. Turned out everyone there was a victim of the same suspect. He looked at eight or so men through one-way glass. Seven of them sort of stood there, while one man in the middle stared down, ''anxious and depressed,'' the editor said.
That's him, the editor told detectives. No. 4.
The ordeal left the editor badly shaken. ''I don't know what would have happened,'' he said, ''if he had gotten in.''

Crow Indians' Lawsuit Against F.B.I. Agent to Proceed

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 13

LENGTH: 634 words

Two families from the Crow Indian Reservation in Montana can proceed with a lawsuit against an F.B.I. agent that accuses him of failing to properly investigate crimes against American Indians on and around the reservation, the United States Supreme Court has ruled.
The court declined last month to reverse a 2010 federal court ruling that said the F.B.I. agent, Matthew Oravec, did not have qualified immunity from legal action, a protection usually given to government employees when acting in an official capacity -- and a status sought by the Justice Department, which had appealed the ruling by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
''The decision puts federal and state law enforcement agents on notice that they may be held personally liable if they discriminate against Indians in investigating crimes against them,'' said Patricia S. Bangert, a Denver lawyer who is representing one of the families.
The Supreme Court's decision was dated Jan. 14, but lawyers were only recently made aware of it.
Mr. Oravec, who remains an F.B.I. employee, investigated the deaths of two men, Robert Springfield and Steven Bearcrane, who died in unrelated episodes on the reservation in 2004 and 2005, respectively.
Federal prosecutors did not file charges in either case, and the men's families sued, accusing Mr. Oravec of conducting a second-rate investigation, which they said was part of a wider problem of discrimination against Indian crime victims on the reservation.
The lawsuit also asserted that Mr. Oravec had sought to intimidate family members, made derogatory remarks about Indians and had refused to carry out basic investigative tasks, including interviewing potential witnesses or taking crime scene photographs.
The Justice Department, which is representing Mr. Oravec, declined to comment.
The rate of violent crime on Indian reservations has for decades been far higher than in the rest of the nation. Most tribes, including the Crow Nation, rely on the federal government to investigate and prosecute serious crime because states generally lack jurisdiction there, and because tribes are prohibited from imposing sentences longer than three years.
But many Indians say that the crime problem is connected to the failure of F.B.I. agents and federal prosecutors to take violent acts on reservations as seriously as they do crimes elsewhere.
The lawsuit is being closely watched around Indian country. Filed in 2009, it maintains that federal officials violated the Fifth Amendment, guaranteeing equal protection and due process rights. In its 2010 ruling, the Ninth Circuit Court dropped several other F.B.I. agents and federal prosecutors from the lawsuit but allowed the claim against Mr. Oravec to continue.
Mr. Bearcrane, 24, was fatally shot on a ranch on the reservation in 2005, but federal officials determined the shooting had been committed in self-defense and declined to prosecute. But Mr. Bearcrane's parents, Earline Cole and Cletus Cole, said that Mr. Oravec had conducted only a cursory investigation before arriving at his conclusion.
Ms. Bangert, who is representing the Bearcrane-Cole family, said they had offered to dismiss the lawsuit if the federal government agreed to allow a third party to investigate independently, but that the government had declined.
''All the Bearcrane-Cole family has wanted is for Steven's death to mean something,'' Ms. Bangert said. ''The government's continuing action in brushing it off as a nonevent that can just be ignored is the continuing fuel for much of the family's anger and anguish.''
In the other case that prompted the lawsuit, Mr. Springfield failed to return from a bow hunting trip on the Crow reservation in 2004. His wife, Veronica Springfield, said the F.B.I. had not looked for him, and his body was found more than a year later.

First Pull-Ups, Then Combat, Marines Say

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 987 words

WASHINGTON -- How many pull-ups does it take to make a female Marine?
The answer, starting next January: a minimum of three, the same number required of male Marines.
If anyone thought the military's decision to allow women into combat units would lead to exceptions for women when it came to fitness and physical strength, this is one service's ''gender neutral'' answer -- or at least part of the answer.
Like the men, women will have to perform the exercises on the Marine Corps's annual physical fitness test as ''dead hang'' pull-ups, without the benefit of the momentum from a lower-body swing. Like the men, women can do the pull-ups underhanded or overhanded, as long as their chins break the plane of the bar. 
The new requirement replaces the old ''flexed arm hang'' for women, in place since 1975, which had to be held for a minimum of 15 seconds.
''The physical requirements of female Marines, commensurate with their roles, have increased greatly since 1975,'' said Col. Sean D. Gibson, a spokesman for the Marine Corps Combat Development Command in Quantico, Va. ''The pull-up is a better test of muscular strength.''
But the new Marine Corps regulations are just part of a sweeping re-examination of fitness standards in the military that Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta's announcement last week ending the ban on women in combat only accelerated.
As it stands now, service members face a gantlet of overlapping fitness tests throughout the vast sprawl of the American military, from initial ones that recruits have to pass to annual fitness (and weight) tests to specific physical requirements that must be met for combat jobs.
The Pentagon says it will not lower standards for women, but is nonetheless reviewing the requirements for hundreds of what are called military occupational specialties to see if they actually match up with the demands of each job.
Some combat jobs that might open to women may require them to meet only specific requirements rather than a wide range of fitness standards.
''We're going to ensure that our tank crewmen are fully capable of removing 50-pound projectiles from the ammunition rack and loading them into the main gun in a sustained manner in a combat situation,'' said George Wright, an Army spokesman.
But for now, the Army has no immediate plans to change its sex-adjusted recruitment and annual fitness tests, even though the Marine Corps, which tenaciously promotes itself as the most hard-bodied service, has started to toughen up its standards for women.
But even for the pull-ups, the Marines are still making some exceptions. To get a perfect grade, women will have to do only 8, compared with the 20 required for men.
''I don't think it's a very high bar,'' said Capt. Ann G. Fox, a Marine Reserve officer who during her first deployment in 2004 worked with the Iraqi Army and who thinks women could do better if it was required of them. ''I think the test should be the same as the men 20 pull-ups. People train to what they're tested on.''
That was the experience of Greg Jacob, who was a commander at the combat training school for enlisted Marines at Camp Geiger, N.C., and said that he asked his female trainers to do the same number of pull-ups as their male students, even though women were not required at the time to do pull-ups at all.
''I saw women who could only do one or two pull-ups be able to bust out, over the course of four or five months, eight pull-ups,'' he said. ''And that was because they were training to that standard.''
Mr. Jacob, now the policy director for the Service Women's Action Network, an advocacy group that worked to end the female combat ban, acknowledged the physiological differences between men and women, but said they were overstated. ''There are lots of men who don't have the same muscle mass as other men,'' he said. ''There is physical diversity regardless of gender.''
Many jobs in the military, he said, have nonnegotiable physical demands. ''Whether you were a man or a woman, you had to throw a live grenade 15 meters,'' he said. ''If a woman throws the hand grenade 10 meters, it's going to blow up in her face and kill her.''
In the Army, no pull-ups are required of either men or women on the annual fitness test, but like the Marines, there are different standards for each sex. A 17- to 26-year-old man in the Army has to run two miles in 15 minutes, 54 seconds or less and do at least 42 push-ups; a woman in the same age group has to run two miles in 18 minutes, 54 seconds or less and do at least 19 push-ups.
The requirements decrease as service members age, although a woman who is 62 or older in the Army still has to run two miles in 25 minutes or less.
Marines, typically, raise the bar. A 17- to 26-year-old male Marine has to run three miles in 28 minutes or less on his annual fitness test; compared with 31 minutes or less for a female Marine of the same age.
The Marines also require all men and women to pass an annual combat fitness test, even though until now women were not officially permitted in combat. The sex-adjusted test drills Marines in how to respond under fire.
All of the tests pale in comparison with one of the most brutal male preserves in the military, the Marines' 86-day Infantry Officer Course at Quantico, Va., which is intended to screen and train potential infantry officers. The test makes extraordinary physical and mental demands on its participants.
Last fall, two female officers went through the course as an experiment and failed, inviting questions -- even though large numbers of men fail -- of whether women were up to it.
Gen. James F. Amos, the commandant of the Marine Corps, held out the possibility that they are. In comments to reporters in San Diego on Thursday, he said he had met with two more female officers who had signed up for the next Infantry Officer Course, starting in March. ''It looks like they're in great shape and they're excited about it,'' he said.

Edward I. Koch, the master showman of City Hall, who parlayed shrewd political instincts and plenty of chutzpah into three tumultuous terms as New York's mayor with all the tenacity, zest and combativeness that personified his city of golden dreams, died Friday. He was 88.
Mr. Koch's spokesman, George Arzt, said he died of congestive heart failure at 2 a.m. at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia hospital.
The former mayor had experienced coronary and other medical problems since leaving office in 1989. But he had been in relatively good health despite -- or perhaps because of -- his whirlwind life as a television judge, radio talk-show host, author, law partner, newspaper columnist, movie reviewer, professor, commercial pitchman and political gadfly.
Ebullient, flitting from broadcast studios to luncheon meetings and speaking engagements, popping up at show openings and news conferences, wherever the microphones were live and the cameras rolling, Mr. Koch, in his life after politics, seemed for all the world like the old campaigner, running flat out. 
Only his bouts of illness slowed Mr. Koch, most recently forcing him to miss a screening on Tuesday of ''Koch,'' a documentary biographical film that opened in New York City on Friday.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg praised him as ''an irrepressible icon, our most charismatic cheerleader and champion,'' calling him ''a great mayor, a great man and a great friend.''
Mr. Koch's 12-year mayoralty encompassed the fiscal austerity of the late 1970s and the racial conflicts and municipal corruption scandals of the 1980s, an era of almost continuous discord that found Mr. Koch caught in a maelstrom day after day.
But out among the people or facing a news media circus in the Blue Room at City Hall, he was a feisty, slippery egoist who could not be pinned down by questioners and who could outtalk anybody in the authentic voice of New York: as opinionated as a Flatbush cabby, as loud as the scrums on 42nd Street, as pugnacious as a West Side reform Democrat mother.
''I'm the sort of person who will never get ulcers,'' the mayor -- eyebrows devilishly up, grinning wickedly at his own wit -- enlightened the reporters at his $475 rent-controlled apartment in Greenwich Village on Inauguration Day in 1978. ''Why? Because I say exactly what I think. I'm the sort of person who might give other people ulcers.''
His political odyssey took him from independent-minded liberal to pragmatic conservative, from street-corner hustings with a little band of reform Democrats in Greenwich Village to the pinnacle of power as the city's 105th mayor from Jan. 1, 1978, to Dec. 31, 1989. Along the way, he put an end to the career of the Tammany boss Carmine G. De Sapio and served two years as a councilman and nine more in Congress representing, with distinction, the East Side of Manhattan.
With his trademark -- ''How'm I doin?'' -- Mr. Koch stood at subway entrances on countless mornings wringing the hands and votes of constituents, who gave him 21 electoral victories in 26 years, with only three defeats: a forgettable 1962 State Assembly race; a memorable 1982 primary in a race for governor won by Mario M. Cuomo; and a last Koch hurrah, a Democratic primary in 1989 won by David N. Dinkins, who would be his one-term successor.
Led New York Into Prosperity
In retrospect, how did he do?
By the usual standards of measuring a former mayor's legacy -- the city he inherited, the challenges he faced, the resources available to meet those challenges and the extent to which his work endured beyond his term -- historians and political experts generally give Mr. Koch mixed-to-good reviews.
Most important, he is credited with leading the city government back from near bankruptcy in the 1970s to prosperity in the 1980s. He also began one of the city's most ambitious housing programs, which continued after he left office and eventually built or rehabilitated more than 200,000 housing units, revitalizing once-forlorn neighborhoods.
Politically, Mr. Koch's move to the right of center was seen as a betrayal by some old liberal friends, but it gained him the middle class and three terms in City Hall. He was also the harbinger of a transformation in the way mayors are elected in New York, with candidates relying less on the old coalition of labor unions, minority leaders and Democratic clubhouses and more on heavy campaign spending and television to make direct appeals to a more independent-minded electorate.
In the end, however, he was overwhelmed by corruption scandals in his administration and by racial divisions that his critics contended he sometimes made worse.
Mr. Koch, for whom the headline ''Hizzoner'' seemed to have been coined, was a bachelor who lived for politics. Perhaps inevitably there were rumors, some promoted by his enemies, that he was gay. But no proof was offered, and, except for two affirmations in radio interviews that he was heterosexual, he responded to the rumors with silence or a rebuke. ''Whether I am straight or gay or bisexual is nobody's business but mine,'' he wrote in ''Citizen Koch,'' his 1992 autobiography.
Mr. Koch was New York's most colorful mayor since Fiorello H. La Guardia. Tall, squinty-eyed, baldish, with a nimbus of gray and a U-shape smile more satanic than cherubic, Mr. Koch told a story like a raconteur in a deli, kvetching and ah-hahing with the timing of a Catskill comic. He loved to clown for photographers on the streets of New York, on a camel in Egypt or on a mechanized sweeper in China.
His image on television, his high-pitched voice on the radio, his round shoulders and gangly arms and baggy pants, and especially his streetwise gusts of candor -- saying what people said over the dinner table in Queens, the Bronx and Brooklyn -- gave New Yorkers the illusion that he was a rumpled, familiar acquaintance. But for all his self-promoting stream of consciousness, he was an intensely private man who revealed little about himself and had no patience for introspection.
Even at the small dinner parties he gave for close political associates and inner-circle friends, whether at Gracie Mansion or in his postmayoral apartment at 2 Fifth Avenue, there were few real intimacies, some participants recalled. The conversations were eclectic, a dance of politics, public affairs and Mr. Koch's city of art and culture.
His first term, students of government say, was his best. Confronted with the deficits and the constraints of the city's brush with bankruptcy in 1975, he held down spending, subdued the municipal unions, restored the city's creditworthiness, revived a moribund capital budget, began work on long-neglected bridges and streets, cut antipoverty programs and tried to reduce the friction between Manhattan and the more tradition-minded other boroughs.
Re-elected in 1981 with 75 percent of the vote -- he became the first mayor in the city's history to get both the Democratic and the Republican nominations -- Mr. Koch markedly improved the city's finances in his second term. Helped by a surging local economy, state aid and rising tax revenues, the city government, with a $500 million surplus, rehired workers and restored many municipal services. He also made plans for major housing programs, improvements in education and efforts to reduce welfare dependency.
A Troubled Third Term
Mr. Koch, riding a huge crest of popularity, was elected in 1985 to a third term, with an amazing 78 percent of the vote. Only two other mayors in modern times, La Guardia and Robert F. Wagner Jr., had achieved third terms, and both found them to be quagmires.
For Mr. Koch, the storm clouds had already begun to gather.
Less than two weeks after Mr. Koch's inauguration, his ally Donald R. Manes, the Queens borough president, attempted suicide -- he succeeded two months later -- in a troubling prelude to one of the worst corruption scandals in city history.
What followed was a series of disclosures, indictments and convictions for bribery, extortion, perjury and conspiracy that touched various city agencies. Much of the skulduggery centered on the Transportation Department and the Parking Violations Bureau. Stanley M. Friedman and Meade H. Esposito -- the Democratic bosses in the Bronx and Brooklyn, respectively, and Koch supporters -- were convicted. Mr. Friedman went to prison, and Mr. Esposito, who was in ill health, received a suspended two-year sentence and a fine.
Anthony R. Ameruso, the transportation commissioner, was forced to resign, and the scandal snared businessmen, lawyers, parking meter attendants, sewer inspectors and others. Scores of convictions were obtained by the United States attorney in Manhattan, Rudolph W. Giuliani.
No one accused Mr. Koch of any wrongdoing. Most of the accused were not his appointees, and none were senior advisers; he had always kept a distance from his commissioners, letting them run their departments with relative independence.
Mr. Koch said that he was shocked, that he had been blindsided by subordinates and associates whose schemes he could not possibly have divined. He always said he had befriended Mr. Friedman, Mr. Esposito, Mr. Manes and others because they controlled votes that could make or break legislation he wanted approved or killed.
But critics said Mr. Koch had become too close to the Democratic bosses in pursuit of his own ambitions, and accusations of complacency and cronyism dogged him for the rest of his tenure.
Mr. Koch was also harshly criticized for what was called his slow, inadequate response to the AIDS crisis in the 1980s. Hundreds of New Yorkers were desperately ill and dying in a baffling public health emergency. (By the end of his mayoralty, more than 5,000 AIDS patients had died in New York City.) Critics, especially in the gay community, accused him of being a closeted gay man reluctant to confront the crisis for fear of being exposed.
For years, Mr. Koch was upset and defensive about the criticism. In a 1994 interview with Adam Nagourney, a New York Times correspondent and co-author, with Dudley Clendinen, of ''Out for Good: The Struggle to Build a Gay Rights Movement in America,'' Mr. Koch said that New York had done more than San Francisco for people with AIDS. ''But that never got through to the gay community,'' Mr. Koch said. ''They were brainwashed that they were getting shortchanged in New York City and in San Francisco they were getting everything. And it wasn't true, but you could never convince them.''
The scandals and the scourges of crack cocaine, homelessness and AIDS were compounded by a widening rift between Mr. Koch and black New Yorkers. The mayor traced his contentious relationship with black leaders to his first-term decision to close Sydenham Hospital in Harlem, where, he said, the city was paying too much for inadequate care. He would regret the decision.
''It was the wrong thing to do,'' Mr. Koch, who rarely second-guessed himself, said in 2009. Closing the hospital saved $9 million, he said, but ''there was such a psychological attachment to Sydenham, because black doctors couldn't get into other hospitals -- it was the psychological attachment that I violated.''
Black leaders were also unhappy with Mr. Koch's decision to purge antipoverty programs and comments he made that they considered insensitive. He said, for example, that busing and racial quotas had done more to divide the races than to achieve integration, and that Jews would be ''crazy'' to vote for the Rev. Jesse Jackson in his 1988 presidential campaign after Mr. Jackson's 1984 reference to New York as ''Hymietown'' and his call for a Palestinian homeland in Israel.
In a city where minorities had long held grievances against a largely white police force, Mr. Koch's 1983 appointment of Benjamin Ward as New York's first black police commissioner hardly appeased critics, and a series of ugly episodes came to symbolize mounting racial troubles.
In 1984, a white officer with a shotgun killed a black woman, Eleanor Bumpurs, 66, as she was being evicted from her Bronx apartment; he was acquitted. In 1986, a gang of white teenagers assaulted three black men in Howard Beach, Queens, chasing one, Michael Griffith, to his death on a highway. And in 1989, a black youth, Yusuf K. Hawkins, 16, who went to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, to see a used car, was attacked by white youths and shot dead.
Mr. Hawkins's death came just a month before Mr. Koch faced Mr. Dinkins, the Manhattan borough president and the only black candidate, in the 1989 Democratic primary. By then, City Hall was lurching from crisis to crisis. The racial divisions, the corruption scandals, the failures to cope with crack and homelessness all contributed to a sense it was time for a change. Mr. Dinkins, pledging to bring the city together again in a ''gorgeous mosaic,'' narrowly defeated Mr. Koch in the primary and went on to beat Mr. Giuliani, who ran on the Republican and Liberal lines, by a slender margin in the general election.
''I was defeated because of longevity, not because Yusuf Hawkins was murdered six weeks before the election, although that was a factor,'' Mr. Koch wrote in New York magazine. ''People get tired of you. So they decided to throw me out. And so help me God, as the numbers were coming in, I said to myself, 'I'm free at last.' ''
Son of Immigrants
Edward Irving Koch was born in Crotona Park East in the Bronx on Dec. 12, 1924, the second of three children of Louis and Joyce Silpe Koch, Polish Jews who had immigrated to New York separately in the early 1900s. Louis was a furrier and a partner in a shop until it folded in the Depression in 1931.
The family then moved to Newark, sharing an apartment with Louis's brother, who ran a catering business. At age 9, Edward, like his humbled father, began working for his uncle in a hat-and-coat-check concession. He later worked as a delicatessen clerk and went to South Side High School in Newark.
One day, when he was 13 and vacationing in the Catskills, he leapt into a lake, swam out and saved his sister, Pat, 6, from drowning. Though a B student, he was president of his school debating society. While his brother, Harold, was athletic, Edward pursued stamp collecting and photography.
After Edward's graduation in 1941, the Koches, back on their feet in the fur business, moved to Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn. For the next two years, the young man went to City College in Manhattan and worked as a shoe salesman.
He was drafted into the wartime Army in 1943 and earned two battle stars in Europe as an infantryman. After V-E Day, because he could speak German, he was sent to Bavaria to help remove Nazi public officials from their jobs and find non-Nazis to take their place. He was a sergeant when discharged in 1946.
After the war, he moved back in with his parents but did not return to undergraduate studies. (City College awarded him a bachelor's degree in 1981.) Instead, he went to law school at New York University. He received his law degree in 1948, was admitted to the bar in 1949 and over the next 20 years practiced law in New York City, becoming a founding partner of Koch, Lankenau, Schwartz & Kovner in 1963.
Mr. Koch began his life in politics in 1952 as a street-corner speaker for Adlai E. Stevenson, who lost the presidential election to Dwight D. Eisenhower. In 1956, already in his 30s, Mr. Koch moved out of his parents' home, took an apartment in Greenwich Village and joined the Village Independent Democrats, a club opposed to Mr. De Sapio and the Manhattan Democratic organization known as Tammany Hall.
Mr. De Sapio, a power broker whose dark glasses gave him a sinister air, could make or break legislators, judges, even mayors. But as district leader in Greenwich Village, he had a narrow base. He had lost his post in 1961 to a reformer, James Lanigan. But it was Mr. Koch, supported by Mayor Wagner, who ended the De Sapio era, thwarting his return to power in the district primary elections in 1963 and 1965. Heading a growing reform movement, Mr. Koch won a City Council seat in 1966 and befriended liberal causes, like antipoverty programs and rent controls.
By 1968, he was ready to move up. An opponent of the Vietnam War and a supporter of Senator Eugene J. McCarthy's presidential candidacy, Mr. Koch, with Democratic and Liberal backing, upset Whitney North Seymour Jr. in what was called a classic American race -- a son of immigrants versus the scion of a family rooted in national history -- and became representative for the 17th Congressional District, the first Democrat to occupy the seat since 1934.
The seat, representing the affluent Upper East Side, parts of Midtown and Greenwich Village, was held by John V. Lindsay until he became mayor in 1966. Mr. Koch later represented the 18th District after a redistricting.
Mr. Koch, in Congress from 1969 to 1977, became known as a hard-working, independent liberal able to work with conservatives. He co-sponsored a law that gave citizens access to their government files and introduced legislation for a national commission on drug abuse. He supported public transportation and housing, Social Security and tax reform, home health care for the elderly, aid to Israel, amnesty for draft resisters, solar energy research, federal financing of abortions and consumer protection measures.
He was re-elected to the House four times by majorities of 62 percent to 77 percent. While in Congress, he stayed in Washington two weekends. He said he got ''the bends'' when outside New York too long. Every Thursday night, he went home for a weekend of campaigning and meeting constituents.
Still, he was almost unknown outside his district when he ran for mayor in 1977, facing six people in the Democratic primary, including the incumbent, Abraham D. Beame; Mario Cuomo, then New York's secretary of state; Representatives Herman Badillo and Bella S. Abzug; the Manhattan borough president, Percy E. Sutton; and Joel W. Hartnett, a businessman and civic watchdog.
But there was wide dissatisfaction with Mayor Beame's handling of the fiscal crisis in 1975; Time magazine put him on the cover as a beggar with a tin cup. Many New Yorkers were also worried about rising crime and spending on social programs.
Mr. Koch benefited from support by The New York Post, but he made the crucial moves. In one master stroke, he hired the consultant David Garth to run his campaign. Sensing the city's rightward drift, Mr. Garth devised a more conservative image for Mr. Koch, a formidable task because the candidate had portrayed himself as a liberal, and he had no wife and children with whom to pose for the decorous voter.
To the rumors about his sexuality, his standard answer was that it was no one's business but his own. Placards sprouted in the 1977 mayoral campaign saying, ''Vote for Cuomo, Not the Homo.'' Mr. Koch did not respond at the time, but 12 years later, in his book ''His Eminence and Hizzoner,'' he recalled, ''When I first saw those posters, I cringed, and I wondered how I would be able to bear it.''
Although Mr. Cuomo always disclaimed responsibility for the posters, Mr. Koch never forgave him, as he made clear with a pointedly disparaging reference to Mr. Cuomo in a recorded interview with The Times that was not to be made public until Mr. Koch's death.
Asked on a WMCA radio show in 1989 about his sexuality, Mr. Koch said that he was heterosexual. ''I happen to believe that there is nothing wrong with homosexuality,'' he said. ''It's whatever God made you. It happens that I'm heterosexual, but I don't care about that. I do care about protecting the rights of 10 percent of our population who are homosexual and who don't have the ability to protect their rights.''
Mr. Koch appeared often in the 1977 race with his close friend and adviser Bess Myerson, a former Miss America and a popular former city commissioner of consumer affairs.
In the campaign, Mr. Koch attacked Mayor Beame's ''clubhouse politics'' and proclaimed himself a ''liberal with sanity'' -- a competent manager who would see the city right.
He made frequent campaign trips to the boroughs outside Manhattan, where he denounced welfare abuse, unconscionable demands by municipal unions and wasteful spending by city agencies. He vowed to crack down on crime, advocated the death penalty in some cases and promised to abolish the Board of Education as ''a lard barrel of waste.''
It worked. Mr. Koch received 20 percent of the primary vote to Mr. Cuomo's 19 percent. Mr. Koch then won a runoff against Mr. Cuomo and went on to take the general election against State Senator Roy M. Goodman, a Republican; Barry Farber, a Conservative; and Mr. Cuomo, who had the Liberal Party line and the dubious distinction of losing three times to Mr. Koch that autumn.
Tackling Financial Ills
Resigning his House seat, Mr. Koch took the reins of a city government that faced a $400 million deficit, crumbling streets and bridges, heavy demands from labor leaders and a bond market that put city securities somewhere between unreliable and unsalable. Many businesses and middle-class residents were leaving, with concomitant losses in tax revenues and jobs.
The mayor rolled up his sleeves. After reaching a settlement with the unions, he scaled down the budget, ordered the attrition of 10 percent of the city's 200,000-member work force and, with state officials, revised a fiscal recovery plan that sought the aid of banks and the state and federal governments. Congress approved loan guarantees of $2 billion, enabling the city to get back into the bond markets, and the road to recovery was paved.
Mr. Koch cut city services and patronage-laden antipoverty programs. There were outcries from some black and Hispanic leaders that he was favoring the middle class, but he balanced the budget in his first term. He also issued an order prohibiting discrimination in city jobs on the basis of sexual orientation, and proposed laws to limit smoking in public places and to provide public financing of political campaigns.
But he had little success in taking back some of the power that had been diffused in previous administrations. He failed to gain control of the quasi-independent Health and Hospitals Corporation and the Board of Education. But he got his man, Frank J. Macchiarola, hired as schools chancellor, and his former deputy mayor -- Robert F. Wagner Jr., son of former Mayor Wagner -- named president of the school board.
After winning his second term, Mr. Koch ran for the Democratic nomination for governor. It was a mistake, compounded by campaign blunders, he conceded later. In an interview with Playboy magazine, he called suburbia ''sterile'' and rural America ''a joke.'' The comments provoked an uproar from insulted suburbanites and upstate residents whose votes he needed.
Mr. Cuomo, the lieutenant governor, won the primary and went on to become governor. ''In the end,'' Andy Logan wrote in The New Yorker, ''the joke was on Koch.''
He had always been frank, leaving himself open to charges of callousness. At various times he skewered and provoked the wrath of Jews and gentiles, business and union leaders, blacks and whites, feminists and male chauvinists. He vilified his Tammany foes as ''crooks'' and ''moral lepers,'' good-government panels as ''elitists,'' black and Hispanic leaders as ''poverty pimps,'' neighborhood protesters as ''crazies'' and Ms. Abzug as ''wacko.''
He was never a man of deep intellect or great vision, students of government and even his associates conceded. But, they said, he was more complex than his blurted assessments and gratuitous insults implied. Critics said he could be petty, self-righteous and a bully when his ideas or policies were attacked.
But associates and admirers, pressed to explain how the mayor could be so popular while reducing city services and apparently alienating so many groups, insisted that Mr. Koch had extraordinary political instincts and theatrical flair, and that his candor only reflected what many New Yorkers had long thought themselves.
It was one thing for a politician to offer excuses for litter, crime and poor transit service, as so many did. But it was another to say, as Mr. Koch did, ''It stinks.'' Over time, many New Yorkers, especially the middle class, came to accept, and relish, his puckish candor.
The honeymoon lasted two terms. After the corruption scandals broke, however, the politics of candor paled, and critics said the mayor began to lose his touch, flip-flopping on issues as political winds shifted. He first sought more accountability from his commissioners, then softened; he first opposed, then supported immunity for those who confessed to bribing public officials.
Mr. Koch's third-term agenda was ambitious: plans to improve education and to cut the welfare rolls, and a 10-year, $5.1 billion capital proposal to attack homelessness and the housing shortage by building or rehabilitating hundreds of thousands of units.
The housing plan, based on dozens of city financing and ownership programs, would become a notable and long-lasting success. It began with a stock of 10,000 properties abandoned by owners or seized by the city for tax delinquency.
By the end of the Koch administration, 3,000 apartments had been created in formerly vacant buildings, 13,000 more were under construction, and design work had begun on 20,000 more. In the next 15 years, over four mayoral administrations, 200,000 more units were built or restored, the number of vacant lots dropped sharply, and the original stock of 10,000 abandoned buildings was reduced to under 800.
But in Mr. Koch's final years in office, his programs were all but overshadowed by scandals. As the mayor waffled, prosecutors charged that thousands of parking meter attendants and sewer, electrical and housing inspectors had taken graft. An avalanche of indictments and convictions ensued.
And the administration's troubles multiplied: 50,000 homeless people crowded into shelters and roamed the streets and subways, and there was a surge of crack-related crimes and growing outrage in minority communities over claims of police brutality.
Then, in 1987, the stock market collapsed, and even the prosperity that had sustained the treasury and the mayor's popularity began to flag. Mr. Koch had a mild stroke that August, and associates said he seemed for a time to lose heart.
By the end of his third term, Mr. Koch was tired. His original faith in government's capacity to solve the problems of families and communities had been eroded; the old liberal had embraced the new creed of Reaganesque reliance on self-help, and it seemed that he had lost some of his old self-confidence.
''It's a big city; you don't know how to get your arms around it, and government becomes the enemy,'' he told Sam Roberts of The Times a few months before he left office. ''Twelve years ago, if someone attacked me, I wouldn't let them get away with it. I'd take them on. I now perceive my job to include allowing people to vent their rage.''
After leaving office, Mr. Koch gave up his rent-controlled flat for a two-bedroom apartment on lower Fifth Avenue, but he gave no thought to retiring. He instead became a one-man media show, with forums on television and radio and in newspapers, magazines and books, besides being a lawyer, endorsing commercial products, lecturing and teaching. He earned over $1.5 million a year.
Mr. Koch had occasional medical problems. He suffered what doctors called a moderate heart attack in 1999, and in 2009 he underwent quadruple bypass surgery and replacement of his aortic valve. He had worn a pacemaker since collapsing with an irregular heartbeat in 1991. There were subsequent hospitalizations for various ailments.
On March 22, 1999, he was briefly hospitalized with low blood pressure hours before he was to be arrested with scores of others in protests organized by a onetime foe, the Rev. Al Sharpton, over the police shooting of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed immigrant from Guinea. Getting himself arrested for a cause raised only a few eyebrows; Mr. Koch, almost a decade out of office, still wanted to march at the head of the parade.
In 2008, approaching 84, he was still pitching -- endorsing Barack Obama for president, shaking the hand of the visiting Pope Benedict XVI, even generating publicity with his own burial plans. ''Koch, Resolved to Spend Eternity in Manhattan, Buys a Cemetery Plot,'' a Times headline said.
In 2010, Mr. Koch took on his most ambitious fight in years, leading a coalition, New York Uprising, against what he called ''a dysfunctional Legislature'' in Albany. He traveled the state on a mission to shame lawmakers who failed to sign a pledge to promote reforms.
''Throw the bums out!'' he shouted in Buffalo. ''You're either on the side of angels or you're a bum. And if the angels betray their pledges, I'm going to run around the state screaming, 'Liar, liar, pants on fire!' ''
At various times he wrote columns for The Post, The Daily News, the online magazine Jewish World Review and the right-wing Web site NewsMax.com. He also wrote movie and restaurant reviews for local weeklies.
He made regular appearances on WCBS-TV, had talk shows on Fox television and on WNEW and WABC radio, teamed with former Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato for a Bloomberg Radio program and was a frequent commentator on the local news television station NY1.
His remarks often sounded like pronouncements by an officeholder, proposing policy changes and oozing invective for political opponents and journalistic rivals. Mr. Koch denied he was wreaking vengeance on old foes, but, as he told New York magazine, ''It's a lot more fun being a critic than being the one criticized.''
Political Influence Lasted
Out of office, Mr. Koch remained influential in New York politics. He crossed party lines to support Mr. Giuliani in the 1993 mayoral election, an endorsement crucial to Mr. Dinkins's defeat. But Mr. Koch later turned against Mr. Giuliani, flaying him as ''a good mayor but a terrible person'' and refusing to endorse him for a second term.
Mr. Koch endorsed Mr. Bloomberg's successful races for mayor as a Republican in 2001 and 2005, calling him about ''as Republican as I am.'' (Mr. Bloomberg later refashioned himself as an independent.) And when Mr. Bloomberg engineered a legislative finesse of term-limits laws to run for a third term in 2009, Mr. Koch backed him and called for an end to term limits.
In presidential races, Mr. Koch went back and forth. He supported the losing Democratic ticket of Al Gore and Joseph I. Lieberman in 2000, but joined the Bush-Cheney re-election bandwagon in 2004 and promoted the Republican National Convention in New York, urging New Yorkers to ''make nice'' to conventioneers. By 2008, he was back with the Democrats, supporting Hillary Rodham Clinton's bid for the nomination and, when she lost, switching to Mr. Obama.
Mr. Koch's only official work in recent years was a 2007 appointment to a panel examining the state comptroller's office after a scandal that forced out Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi.
Mr. Koch appeared, mostly as himself, in a score of movies, including ''The Muppets Take Manhattan'' and ''The First Wives Club,'' and in cameo roles on television shows, including ''Sex and the City.''
And he was the star, of course, of ''Koch,'' the documentary film by Neil Barsky that had its premiere on Tuesday at the Museum of Modern Art. Mr. Koch, hospitalized, was forced to miss the event.
For years Mr. Koch worked out with a personal trainer almost every morning at a gym. He became a partner with Robinson, Silverman, Pearce, Aronsohn & Berman, which in a 2002 merger became Bryan Cave, an international law firm and one of the largest real estate practices in New York. He provided advice and brought in many clients.
He became an adjunct professor at New York University, Brandeis University and Baruch College of the City University of New York, and gave lectures across the country and abroad, with minimum fees of $20,000 for off-the-cuff talks on race relations, drugs, anti-Semitism or ''Koch on the City,'' ''Koch on the State'' or ''Koch on Everything.''
From 1997 to 1999, he was the judge on the nationally syndicated show ''The People's Court,'' hearing small claims and ribald testimony like that of a man who claimed he suffered whiplash from a topless dancer's breasts. Mr. Koch was done in by the competing ''Judge Judy'' -- Judith A. Sheindlin, a retired New York City Family Court judge -- and was replaced by her husband, Gerald Sheindlin, a retired State Supreme Court justice. Mr. Koch had appointed both to the bench.
He wrote more books -- 17 in all -- murder mysteries, commentaries on politics, and other subjects. Most were a blend of his insights, experiences and observations with co-authors providing the workaday prose. In office, he produced ''Mayor'' (1984), ''Politics'' (1985) and ''His Eminence and Hizzoner'' (1989). Later came ''All the Best: Letters From a Feisty Mayor'' (1990), ''Ed Koch on Everything'' (1994), ''I'm Not Done Yet'' (2000) and ''Buzz: How to Create It and Win With It'' (2007).
Mr. Koch and his sister, Pat Koch Thaler, wrote ''Eddie: Harold's Little Brother,'' a children's book that appeared in 2004. His brother, Harold M. Koch, a carpet distributor, died in 1995. Besides his sister, a former dean at N.Y.U. whom he saw regularly in later years, Mr. Koch is survived by New York itself, as an old friend put it a few years ago.
''The city was and is his family,'' said Maureen Connelly, a former press secretary and veteran political adviser. ''We used to be scared about what would happen to Ed if he lost. We said it would be best if he just died in the saddle. But he never had any intention of getting off the horse.''
Funeral Arrangements: Edward I. Koch's funeral will be held at 11 a.m. on Monday at Temple Emanu-El, Fifth Avenue and 65th Street in Manhattan. The funeral will be televised by NY1. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said a private shiva for Mr. Koch would be held on Tuesday at Gracie Mansion.

CORRECTION: 
Because of an editing error, an obituary on Feb. 2 about Edward I. Koch, the former mayor of New York, referred incorrectly to ''Koch,'' the new documentary film about his life. It opened on Feb. 1 in New York City, not nationwide, and illness forced Mr. Koch to miss a prerelease screening of the film on Jan. 29 -- not the premiere, which took place on Jan. 10 at the Walter Reade Theater as part of the New York Jewish Film Festival.
The obituary also referred incorrectly to a suicide attempt by Donald R. Manes, the Queens borough president and a Koch ally. Mr. Manes, who committed suicide in March 1986, first tried to kill himself either late on Jan. 9 or early on Jan. 10 of that year, less than two weeks after Mr. Koch was inaugurated for a third term -- not ''weeks'' after the inauguration.
In addition, the obituary referred imprecisely to the number of elections Mr. Koch won between 1963 and 1989. While he did win 21 elections in that period, many of them were primaries; it was not the case that his constituents ''elected him 21 times in 26 years.''

Where Las Vegas Stardust Rests in Peace

LENGTH: 1518 words

LAS VEGAS -- We may be made of star stuff, as the astronomer Carl Sagan once said, but our imaginations contain a strong dose of ''Stardust'' -- at least as the word appears here. The capital S, its 17-foot-tall body peppered with bulbs, is shaped like a coy lightning bolt. Its jagged strokes change thickness and meet at unexpected angles, like the stylized clothes of ''The Jetsons.'' The T's are like toon sketches of rays shooting from stars.
And the whole word here -- though not lighted up with pulsing energy as it once was -- seems to conjure fantasy. It doesn't just advertise the name of a Las Vegas casino, now defunct. Its associated whiffs of sci-fi adventure and high-tech possibility -- of stardust and neon -- are imprinted on the imaginations of several generations.
The letters appear here in the outdoor ''boneyard'' of the Neon Museum, just past a time-rubbed Aladdin's lamp and a shattered signature of tubed glass that once heralded the Liberace Museum. A boneyard is an outdoor graveyard for discarded hardware and spare parts; in this case it contains the relics of an age of neon in a town that transmuted inert gases into things nearly alive. 
The museum began in 1996 as a modest attempt to rescue remnants of that era, later leasing city land for its own boneyard of salvaged signs. The Young Electric Sign Company, once Las Vegas's most innovative sign manufacturer, also donated its jangle of corpses. The collection grew.
Over the years the boneyard began to live up to its name with peeling paint, empty sockets and rusted metal, and the museum began to live up to its name with tours on request through its one and a half acres containing about 450 elements from often kitschy signs. Public and private money was raised for what became a $4 million project (including a small park across the street). By raising another $2.5 million, the museum was able to restore 15 major signs to their full glory. They were mounted downtown and on Las Vegas Boulevard (including the light-spangled Silver Slipper outside the museum).
Finally, the lobby building of the 1961 La Concha Motel, which the museum helped save from the ax, was moved here. Its poured concrete clamshell design, revealing glass walls beneath its whorls, was restored to the vision of its creator, Paul Revere Williams. It opened last fall as a kind of museum lobby, providing a small store, display screens surveying Las Vegas history, and a place where visitors could meet guides for a 45-minute tour, which is still the only way the artifacts can be viewed. With set hours, a visitor center and a staff, the boneyard is being resurrected in museum form. Annual attendance is expected to double from the roughly 20,000 of the past.
This does not mean that the museum has reached maturity. But before chiding it for reticence amid its display of ruin, homage is due. The museum's executive director, Danielle Kelly, took me through the boneyard, bringing many of the signs to life and defending the decision to leave artifacts unlabeled and to preserve them in disrepair. And the wreckage is uncanny, sometimes lovely, often haunting.
Stick with Stardust for a moment. As those letters stand here, we can't really get their full impact. They come from the original sign that made its debut with the casino in 1958. It was just after Sputnik was launched, and tourists were gathering here to watch atomic blasts at the Nevada Test Site. Its font became famously known as ''Electra Jag'' or, more familiarly, ''Atomic.''
The sign was the Strip's largest, 216 feet long, rising 27 feet above the casino's first floor, with 11,000 bulbs and 7,000 feet of neon tubing, sparkling with extraterrestrial splendor: it displayed the entire solar system, the Earth at its pre-Copernican center. It has been suggested that the original pinkish lettering matched the color of Vegas's radioactive dust. The sign made an explosive impact and could be seen for three miles across the desert, a blast in its own right.
Are we missing something by seeing it in such unilluminated disrepair, its paint peeling, many sockets empty, its spectacular context missing? Moving this sign cost about $180,000. What is it we are perceiving here? What happens when we look at it? Or at the swoops of tubing that was Debbie Reynolds's giant signature for her casino? Or at a portion of the three-story-high sheath of animated neon that once wrapped the Golden Nugget?
You can get some idea by looking at old photographs at the visitor center or touring the Mob Museum nearby. In the early 1960s -- the Renaissance of Neon -- Tom Wolfe described Las Vegas as ''the only town in the world whose skyline is made up neither of buildings, like New York, nor of trees, like Wilbraham, Mass., but signs.''
In their startlingly original book, ''Learning From Las Vegas'' (1972), the architects Robert Venturi, Denise Scott Brown and Steven Izenour pointed out that signs might be the most ''changeable'' aspect of Las Vegas, but also ''the most unique, most monumental parts of the Strip.''
The Golden Nugget casino, they write, evolved over 30 years ''from a building with a sign on it to a totally sign-covered building.'' They refer to this as creating a ''decorated shed.'' No one in Las Vegas, Mr. Wolfe suggested, buys a sign to fit a building; the building is modified to support the largest possible sign.
These signs, then, are more substance than ornament. Behind the original Stardust sign and its casino were motel-like buildings, undecorated sheds. They were lifted from the mundane partly by being given planetary names, but mainly by the neon's afterglow. The sign transformed what was within not by pointing to it like a traditional sign, but by pointing somewhere else -- here, to the fantastical, explosive possibilities of the atomic space age. Signs had to be spectacular because they were enactments of fantasy fulfilled. You want stardust? Here it is.
That might give an idea of what was once at stake here. One of the most striking signs is from the 1955 Moulin Rouge, its cursive letters curving into elegant patterns in which the art historian Kirsten Swenson fancifully sees a mock-Arabic script -- as if invoking the early 20th century's French African colonies. And, indeed, the Moulin Rouge was advertised as ''the nation's first major interracial hotel'' at a time when most casinos made racial ''exceptions'' only for entertainment. But it closed just months after opening.
In their broken, darkened state, these signs have another form of illumination: their distractions and disguises are unveiled, their motivations made clear. Mr. Wolfe compared Las Vegas to Versailles, partly because both were calculated projections. The Sun King, he pointed out, built a monument to his power not in Paris, but in the countryside. In Las Vegas, casino creators were the king's opposites, thorough nonaristocrats: gangsters. But they were the first Americans with enough money and power to build monuments to themselves outside established cultural centers.
Some signs, then, are both monuments and alibis. The Stardust, after all, had a history of corruption and violence; the mob runs through it (a story told in Nicholas Pileggi's ''Casino'').
But the signs are so clearly a charade that you aren't really taken in. You see the lure of fleshly vanity, stardust and sensuality, yet, as in those 17th-century vanitas paintings, you also see the skeletal reality. Using Google Earth, you can zoom in on the museum's boneyard: at its center, plundered from the Treasure Island casino, is a giant pirate skull with a golden tooth.
The themes are rich. What is needed is more information. The museum's companion book, ''Spectacular: A History of Las Vegas Neon,'' is deft and informative, but it would help to have signs labeled and the narrative more clearly defined. And a deeper exploration of neon's past on the new video screens would help make sense of the surprisingly different present.
There are, of course, still signs in Las Vegas. But as the authors of ''Spectacular'' point out, the contemporary casino has become a sign unto itself. Beginning in the 1990s, themed casinos, like the Luxor and Excalibur, turned their entire structures into signs: an Egyptian pyramid, a medieval castle.
That effect endures even when the approach is more abstract. The Wynn, for example, calls attention to itself by having no apparent theme; it is a sleek, showy, mirrored curve of gold -- a surface with no grit, only gleam. Inside the Wynn the fantasy shifts with images of ripe flowers bursting into extravagant bloom in bouquets, floor patterns, paintings, even stage sets for the casino's show. Sensual fullness and fecundity within, gilded excess and elegance without. Who needs neon when everything is a sign?
But if you find yourself succumbing to stardust's allure too completely, you can now go to the Neon Museum and see what happens to all that flash when colors fade and decay sets in. The museum is Las Vegas's vanitas. Except that its bones are still lovely, and the skulls still work their charms.

Suicide Attack at Market in Northwest Pakistan Kills at Least 21

PESHAWAR, Pakistan -- An explosion in a market in northwestern Pakistan on Friday killed at least 21 people and wounded 33 in what the police described as a suicide bombing. 
The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack in Hangu, about 70 miles west of Peshawar, the capital of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province. Abu Omar, a Taliban commander in the neighboring tribal region of North Waziristan, said in a telephone interview that the attack was in revenge for the killing on Thursday of a Sunni cleric.
The cleric, Mufti Abdul Majeed Deenpuri, 60, was shot in the southern port city of Karachi, setting off fears of reprisals against Shiites.
Mr. Deenpuri was a senior teacher at Jamia Binoria, one of the largest seminaries in Pakistan. A gunman opened fire on a vehicle carrying the cleric and a colleague at a busy intersection and then fled.
While the security situation is precarious across Pakistan, Rehman Malik, the interior minister, had warned of the potential for an attack in Karachi, a sprawling, violence-prone port city. Cellphone service was suspended there from noon to 3 p.m. during Friday Prayer.
Sectarian violence has also occurred in Hangu in the past, often forcing the authorities to impose a curfew. The town borders the Orakzai tribal region, where the army and paramilitary forces are fighting Taliban militants.
Friday's explosion occurred just after Friday Prayer as worshipers filed out of nearby Sunni and Shiite mosques, police officials said. ''People were coming out of the mosque when the explosion occurred,'' said one officer in Hangu, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
Another police official in Hangu said a suicide bomber had detonated his explosives. While Shiites were the likely target, the dead included people from both Islamic sects, he said.
Separately, a Pakistani intelligence official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said 30 mortar shells fired from Afghanistan on Friday morning killed six residents of Angoor Adda, a border village in South Waziristan. However, there was no official comment from the Pakistani military, and a local government official gave a conflicting number of casualties, saying three people were killed and six wounded.
In recent years, Pakistan and Afghanistan have traded barbs over accusations of cross-border rocket and artillery fire. The 1,510-mile craggy border between the two countries has long posed a problem for both sides, each accusing the other of not manning the border effectively. Both sides maintain that insurgents easily cross over the porous border, but plans to fence the border have been rejected as impractical.
On Thursday, Human Rights Watch released its World Report 2013, which sharply criticized the Pakistani government and its military and intelligence agencies for failing to reduce human rights abuses.
''Pakistan's human rights crisis worsened markedly in 2012 with religious minorities bearing the brunt of killings and repression,'' said Ali Dayan Hasan, the director in Pakistan for Human Rights Watch.

No Suspects Are Identified In Texas Prosecutor's Death

BYLINE: By LAUREN D'AVOLIO and MANNY FERNANDEZ. 
Lauren D'Avolio reported from Kaufman, and Manny Fernandez from Houston.

KAUFMAN, Tex. -- The county courthouse here reopened Friday, the day after it was locked down and closed after the fatal shooting of a lead prosecutor by an unknown killer or killers. 
The prosecutor, Mark E. Hasse, 57, was shot multiple times on Thursday morning in an employee parking lot about a block from his courthouse office in this small North Texas town southeast of Dallas. The authorities said one or two gunmen got out of a gray or silver sedan, opened fire and then sped away. Witnesses told investigators that the man or men appeared to have their faces covered and wore black clothing and tactical-style vests. They remain the focus of a local, state and federal manhunt.
At a news conference Friday morning, law enforcement officials said they had not yet established a motive nor identified any suspects. They were pursuing tips that had come in from the public and examining Mr. Hasse's current and past cases. ''We are reviewing Mr. Hasse's cases and following up on any leads within those cases that would give us rise for a person of interest,'' said Chris Aulbaugh, the Kaufman police chief.
Chief Aulbaugh said that witnesses observed aspects of the shooting from various angles, and that the suspects wore some type of disguise. ''The facial features and bodily features were covered,'' Chief Aulbaugh said. ''Different witnesses gave us different accounts of how they were covered.''
Mr. Hasse was an assistant district attorney and the lead felony prosecutor for Kaufman County. In the 1980s, he worked as a prosecutor for nearby Dallas County, where he oversaw organized-crime cases. He became a criminal defense lawyer in East Texas before joining the Kaufman County office about three years ago. He was unmarried and did not have children. He was also known to carry a firearm and was a state-licensed peace officer, but the authorities declined to say if he was armed at the time of the shooting.
Kaufman County prosecutors have helped in investigations of the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas prison gang. The shooting occurred the same day that two gang members -- Ben Christian Dillon of Houston and James Marshall Meldrum of Dallas -- pleaded guilty to racketeering charges in federal court in Houston, part of a multiagency investigation that led to the indictment of more than 30 senior leaders and other members of the whites-only gang in November.
Asked if Mr. Hasse had any role in that case, a spokeswoman for the United States attorney's office for the Southern District of Texas, which is prosecuting the Aryan Brotherhood members, declined to comment.
Prosecutors and lawyers in the North Texas region said the killing of a respected prosecutor in broad daylight outside the county courthouse was a brazen, unprecedented attack on the local criminal justice system. The Dallas County district attorney, Craig Watkins, told WFAA-TV in Dallas on Friday that the shooting illustrated the need for heightened security for prosecutors.
''This shines a light on the fact that D.A.'s, just like any other law enforcement officer, they have to have security, but for whatever reason we don't have that,'' Mr. Watkins said. A number of donors have contributed to a reward being offered for information leading to an arrest and conviction in the shooting. It stands at more than $71,000.

A Rebel Commander in Syria Holds the Reins of War

BYLINE: By C. J. CHIVERS

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; THE SATURDAY PROFILE; Pg. 6

LENGTH: 1435 words

ALEPPO, Syria
THE would-be assassin was patient, if not an accomplished shot.
His victim, the Syrian rebel commander Hajji Marea, was fighting a cold and had sent a bodyguard out to find medicine, the commander's supporters said. As he waited, Hajji Marea stepped outside to make a phone call, when the gunman fired. The bullet missed his head, and struck his left shoulder.
Months later, Hajji Marea made a fist with his left hand, demonstrating that he had healed, even while the Syrian government's bounty remained. ''The bone was broken, but it is O.K. now,'' he said, before dressing against the chill and heading back onto the city's streets, where artillery boomed.
Such is the persona of Abdulkader al-Saleh, a k a Hajji Marea, an example of the antigovernment leadership emerging inside Syria -- a phenomenon unfolding on battlefields only intermittently visited by outsiders. 
Mr. Saleh leads the military wing of Al Tawhid, the largest antigovernment fighting group operating in and near Syria's most populous city, Aleppo -- a position that has made him one of the government's most wanted men.
The uprising to unseat President Bashar al-Assad is now almost two years old. While Western governments have long worried that its self-declared leaders, many of whom operate from Turkey, cannot jell into a coherent movement with unifying leaders, the fighting across the country has been producing a crop of field commanders who stand to assume just these roles.
These men -- with inside connections, street credibility and revolutionary narratives that many of the Western-recognized leadership lacks -- have taken the reins of the war. They hold the weapons. They have their own international relations and financing.
Should they survive, many of them could become Syria's postwar power brokers.
The commanders range from secular and chain-smoking former military officers who are products of the same institutions they are fighting, to bearded extremists working for an Islamic Syria based on their interpretation of religious law.
Men like Mr. Saleh present both a challenge and an opportunity for the West as it struggles to understand what is happening in Syria and to nurture networks that might provide stability and routes for Western influence should the government fall.
Mr. Saleh's long-term intentions are not entirely clear. He says he is focused solely on winning the war, and promotes a tolerant pluralistic vision for the future. He is also openly aligned with Al Nusra Front, a growing Islamic militia that has been blacklisted by the United States, which accuses it of embracing terrorist tactics.
Officials in Washington are aware of Mr. Saleh, and other commanders of his standing. There is no evidence that they have connections with them, or a plan for how to develop relations in a Syria that is partly under their influence.
MR. SALEH, wounded in battle multiple times, survived an assassination attempt in the fall, adding to his legend in the Aleppo governorate, where he is the rebels' primary military commander.
''Was it $200,000?'' he asked a peer, during a recent interview in a command post hidden in an Aleppo basement, about the bounty for his head. He seemed uninterested by the answer.
''Our concern now is only in the military side and how to fight this regime and finish this,'' he said.
The son of a shopkeeper in Marea, just north of Aleppo, Mr. Saleh took an indirect route to guerrilla leader. As a young man, he served two and a half years as an army conscript, working, he said, in a chemical weapons unit.
He later joined the Dawa religious movement as a missionary. He traveled abroad, including, one of his brothers said, to Jordan, Turkey and Bangladesh, where he taught and studied Islam and invited people to hear the call to faith.
Life in Syria lured him back. His hometown lies in an agricultural belt, ringed by dark-soiled fields. Mr. Saleh opened a shop on one of Marea's main streets, from where he imported and sold seeds. He married and started a family, which grew to include five children.
Not long after the uprising began, he joined with neighbors and relatives to organize demonstrations against what he described as the government's repression.
When the fighting began, and rebels formed underground cells to plan ambushes, make bombs and persuade government soldiers to defect, Mr. Saleh's standing grew. People spoke of a successful commander who was honest, organized and almost serenely calm under fire.
In many quarters his identity remained unknown. ''We were secretive,'' he said. ''The public knew there was someone named Hajji Marea who led the demonstrations. But nobody knew who he was.''
Though he stands a little more than six feet tall, Mr. Saleh is unimposing, retaining an open face and youthful lankiness. Outsiders might not even make him for a fighter. One recent day, wearing a hoodie and moving with a loping gait, he could have passed for a graduate student.
His battlefield name, Hajji Marea, roughly translated, means ''the respectable man from Marea.''
BY last summer, the fighting units near Aleppo had chased most government forces from the countryside and seized control of a border crossing to Turkey. Simultaneously, Mr. Saleh was emerging as the main leader of Al Tawhid. His anonymity ended.
He was soon seen as pragmatic and accommodating, an active commander who was able to navigate the uprising's sometimes seemingly contradictory social worlds. A friend of the Islamists fighting beside him, he also spoke of avoiding the nihilism of sectarian war.
One of his subcommanders, Omar Abdulkader of the Grandsons of Saladin, a Kurdish fighting group, described how Mr. Saleh welcomed him and fellow fighters into Al Tawhid -- though they were not Arabs.
''He has supported us since we have formed our battalion, and he bought for us some weapons and ammunition,'' he said. ''We've never heard or seen any bad acts from him -- all good deeds all the time.''
He added: ''Hajji Marea told us there is no difference between Muslim or Christian, Kurdish or Arab or even Alawi. We are all brothers.''
These days, when Mr. Saleh appears in public, his supporters treat him with reverential deference. In the summer, Mr. Saleh arrived at a meeting of commanders in another hidden command post. Several seasoned battalion leaders almost sat at his feet.
Analysts of the war say that for those who hope to speed the end to the violence or have influence in Syria afterward, men like Mr. Saleh present a diplomatic challenge. Should foreign governments and aid organizations try to establish connections and open a dialogue, before the window narrows?
At least one organization has tried. Although some antigovernment fighters in Aleppo have participated in abuses and battlefield excesses -- including the summary execution of prisoners -- the perpetrators have often not been identified and the crimes have not been directly linked to Mr. Saleh or his immediate followers, a researcher with Human Rights Watch said.
The researcher, Ole Solvang, said the rights group had urged Mr. Saleh to direct his fighters to behave lawfully. ''As an influential military opposition leader, Hajji Marea has a particular responsibility to ensure that opposition fighters do not commit such abuses,'' Mr. Solvang said.
For Western governments, outreach is problematic, in part because of Washington's policies, which rebels said first were noncommittal, then shaped by fears of Islam and a tendency toward counterterrorism solutions.
One American official called Mr. Saleh ''the real thing'' -- a commander with thousands of fighters, independent sources of financing and supply, good relations with other fighting groups and a record of tactical success.
But Mr. Saleh, who said he differentiates between the American people, who he said support the uprising, and the American government, which he said does not, did not hide his displeasure with the Obama administration.
Like many activists and rebels, he saw inconsistency and hypocrisy in Washington's position, which Syrians often summarize as this: For the Assad government to use chemical weapons would be unacceptable; for it to kill civilians with conventional weapons is fine.
''America keeps silent,'' he said. ''The way we see it as Arabs: If you are silent, then you are agreeing with what is happening.''
Sitting nearby, Abdel-Aziz Salameh, Al Tawhid's political leader, warned that time was running short for the United States. ''All the world has abandoned us,'' he said. ''If the revolution lasts for another year, you'll see all the Syrian people like Al Qaeda; all the people will be like Al Qaeda.''

Soldiers In Lebanon Die in Raid Near Syria

BYLINE: By ANNE BARNARD and HWAIDA SAAD; Anne Barnard reported from Beirut, and Jodi Rudoren from Jerusalem. Reporting was contributed by Irit Pazner Garshowitz from Jerusalem, Ellen Barry from Moscow, Thomas Erdbrink from Tehran, and Alan Cowell from London.

BEIRUT, Lebanon -- At least three Lebanese Army soldiers were killed Friday in a shootout as they tried to arrest a resident of a village that has become a hub of refugees and where Syrian rebels often cross the border. Their target was also fatally shot.
There were conflicting reports about the nature of the clash, in which security forces were ambushed as they pursued a wanted man, but the episode played into fears that the accelerating influx of Syrians could spread the conflict into Lebanon. 
The village, Aarsel, lies in the eastern Bekaa Valley, a mountainous region bordering Syria, and is a stronghold of support for the rebellion against the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. Syrian refugees who prefer to avoid areas of the Bekaa that are closely controlled by Hezbollah, an ally of Mr. Assad, have also crammed into the town.
In a statement, the Lebanese Army said that a captain was among those killed and declared without elaborating, ''There will be no compromises on attempts to hide armed militants.''
Some reports, citing unnamed security sources, said that the soldiers were attacked by Syrian rebels, while residents said that villagers chased down and attacked plainclothes security personnel who arrived to arrest a Lebanese suspect without coordinating with local leaders.
The suspect, a resident of Aarsel, was identified as Khaled Hummayed. Lebanon's national news agency said that he was wanted for involvement in the kidnapping of Estonian tourists in the Bekaa in 2011.
Several Lebanese media outlets said that members of the Free Syrian Army, the loose-knit rebel coalition, attacked the soldiers, while Reuters reported that Mr. Hummayed was believed to be a member of a jihadist rebel group that has been active in Syria, Al Nusra Front, who traveled frequently in and out of the country.
The deputy mayor of Aarsel said Mr. Hummayed was driving a pickup truck when security personnel in civilian cars confronted him, shot him and left with his body. He said he did not know if Mr. Hummayed was involved with Syrian rebels, but added that ''90 percent of Aarsel's people support the revolution.''
A smuggler from Aarsel, who gave only a nickname, Abu Hussein, said he was on the way to Friday Prayer and witnessed the shootout. He said that Mr. Hummayed's pickup truck was left behind, smeared with blood, as angry residents pursued the cars. He said that Mr. Hummayed had once draped the flag of the Syrian revolution around his body.
Supporters of the revolution are deeply suspicious of Lebanese security forces, which they see as aiding the Syrian government. Lebanon has officially adopted a policy of ''disassociation'' from the Syrian conflict.
But in practice, many Lebanese have taken sides, with many Sunni Muslims supporting the rebellion led by Syria's Sunni majority, while Hezbollah, a Shiite Muslim movement that relies on Syria as an arms conduit, has supported the government dominated by Mr. Assad's Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiism.
The border area has been tense, with rebels hiding and resting on the Lebanese side, and Syrian troops sometimes shelling Lebanese territory, crossing the border to fight rebels or shooting civilian refugees as they flee.
New pressures are growing as the flow of refugees -- there are already more than 200,000 in Lebanon, a country of four million -- overtaxes Sunni areas that have hosted most of them and pushes refugees into new areas.
More than two million people are displaced inside Syria, and on Friday, the United Nations children's agency said 420,000 people -- half of them children -- need urgent help in Homs Province.
A spokeswoman for Unicef, Marixie Mercado, told reporters in Geneva that 200 of Homs's 1,500 schools were damaged, with 65 more housing refugees, news agencies reported.
The United Nations refugee agency said it had for the first time reached Azaz, a town near the Turkish border, to deliver tents with Syrian government permission, and found 45,000 people living in makeshift tents.

In New York, Echoes of a Talkative Mayor

BYLINE: By THE NEW YORK TIMES

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 17

LENGTH: 542 words

A chance encounter at a Citarella. An impromptu performance in a tourism commercial. A tough job interview. Former Mayor Edward I. Koch, who died on Friday,
left a lasting impression on those who met him. Readers were invited to share their reflections about the mayor. Following are excerpts:
I was working at an ad agency and we were shooting the 25th anniversary ''I Love NY'' spot. It was all well-known New Yorkers singing the iconic jingle. We had Chita Rivera, Savion Glover, Tommy Tune, Beverly Sills, Tony Randall, Jack Klugman. We had a baby grand piano in the middle of Washington Square Park. Just as we were wrapping, I noticed Ed Koch walking through the park, carrying his dry cleaning. I ran up to the producer and said we have to shoot him singing ''I Love NY.'' So we woke up the director in his trailer and shot him. And with no rehearsal, he sang a verse. Then he grabbed a bagel from the snack table, asked ''How am I doing?'' and left with his dry cleaning. 
Ken, N.Y.C.
Just saw him buying vegetables at Citarella a month or so ago. Moving slow, with a car waiting outside, but doing it himself. The people who recognized him couldn't help but smile, including me. Can't imagine feeling that way about any subsequent mayor. Iconic like Lindsay. A reminder of when New York had character, warts and all.
Stuart, New York
During his first run for mayor, he was standing at the finish line of a five-mile race in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, campaigning, amazingly all alone -- he wasn't very well-known yet. When I finished the run, he asked me what my time was. I told him. And in atypical politician form, he replied, ''That's not very good.'' His forthrightness made me smile (it wasn't so bad, around 36 minutes). I voted for him each time he ran for mayor. He was New York. Dg, N.Y.C.
Years ago, a group of friends (none of whom were from New York) wanted to spend a day exploring the city. We lined up a list of restaurants and landmarks to visit. Feeling nostalgic for a childhood spent under the Koch administration, I e-mailed Mayor Koch and invited him to join us for lunch. Although I had never met him before, he accepted the invitation and entertained us with stories and jokes over a delightful and memorable two-hour meal. Justin Zaremby, New York
When he was interviewing me for the health commissioner position, Ed asked me a surprise question.
It was several weeks after the Queens Democratic Party corruption scandal and the Donald Manes suicide.
''Some people think I myself am involved in the corruption scandal,'' Ed said. ''What do you think?''
(I realized that if I said, ''You might be,'' that was not good. If I said, ''Oh no, not you, Mr. Mayor,'' that was also not good. I wouldn't hire me with either answer.)
So I said, ''You know, Mr. Mayor, I have been coming up to New York from D.C. for these interviews, and taking taxis from La Guardia Airport to here. And as a born New Yorker, I know that the New York cabbies always know what is going on. So I have been asking them the same question you just asked me. And they say you are O.K. And if the cabbies think you are O.K., then I guess I think you are O.K.''
I got the job.
And Ed was even better than O.K.
Stephen C. Joseph, M.D.
City Commissioner of Health, 1986-90

Planning for Armageddon
In ''The Preppers Next Door'' last Sunday, Alan Feuer reported on New Yorkers who stockpile supplies and equipment to enable them to survive in the event of a major disaster, even the collapse of civilization. On NYTimes.com, readers shared their opinions on the subject. A selection of their comments is below.
SINCE 9/11 AND THEN the financial debacle, I keep a supply handy. That is, I've a deep freezer with food, a bunch of big candles, camping cooking gear, several five-gallon containers of water, copies of important papers, go bag, a few plastic tubs of canned and dry food. In the car, sleeping bags, tent and more camping cooking gear. But ... that's it. I'm just thinking blackouts, natural disasters, quarantines, even my own illness, etc. ... 
If I need to stay put for a week or two, I'm good. I'm definitely not thinking of ''bugging out.'' In that scenario you're much more at risk of harm competing with panicked masses. Better, much better, to just stay put and let ''the storm'' pass. And, if it's the end of the world, then... it's the end of the world. I'm not fighting it. Most likely we're talking about a temporary nuisance, not Armageddon. So... pack a deck of cards.
MARK ZILBERMAN, LCSW,
NORTH BERGEN
WHAT I WONDER IS, what happens after all your rations run out? If things get so bad, in the scenarios these people expect, having three days or two weeks of food and water that runs out would be cold comfort. I think the best advice is to imagine a better future as much as possible and enjoy life today. Work for a better world. If you choose to put something aside like food and water, be willing to share it. It has been demonstrated over and over again that people have an instinct for community and band together in times of trouble. Personally, I like to imagine a future that isn't frightening, something a lot brighter.
TERRY, SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS
MANY CALIFORNIANS HAVE prepared themselves for a common natural disaster that occurs here: earthquakes. We have our grab-n-go bags under our beds, and a larger stash of food, water, and clothing in a sealed canister outside the house (in case the house should collapse). In addition, there is a small tool kit to turn off water and gas, as flooding and fire often do more damage than the quake itself.
HAMMOND, SAN FRANCISCO
THE WAY TO KEEP civilization from ending is to begin funding our libraries again and to begin reading books again. Maybe listening to some classical music? How about a little art? Turner, perhaps? Movies from the golden age of Hollywood? A little less crassness on the radio, less violence on screen, less aggression that passes for music? More true courtesy and kindness towards others? Not so much machismo or master-race stuff? Fewer guns?
While we can't guarantee that the rest of the world or even our own neighbors will follow suit, we can at least start at home. If we can't survive civilized, at least we won't perish as louts.
B., BROOKLYN
IF YOU HAVE been wilderness backpacking for a week, you have all the equipment, emotional and hardware, to survive for a week during a natural disaster. If you have never been in the wilderness for a week, all this gear will make you more comfortable if you are able to stay in your home. If you are forced to bug-out, you will not be ready physically or emotionally for the challenges you will surely face.

The Way Out

BYLINE: By BRYAN MEALER. 
Mark Ovaska's photographs focus on social issues. Bryan Mealer's latest book is ''Muck City: Winning and Losing in Football's Forgotten Town.''

SECTION: Section SR; Column 0; Sunday Review Desk; EXPOSURES; Pg. 6

LENGTH: 401 words

WHEN the Baltimore Ravens and the San Francisco 49ers take the field during the Super Bowl today, the teams will have five players who come from a small, conflicted region in the northern Everglades known as Muck City. The dark, silty soil surrounding the Florida towns of Belle Glade and Pahokee, some 45 miles west of Palm Beach, creates a fertile region for agriculture. 
Many of the black residents of the area were drawn there by the opportunity to work in the vegetable fields that surrounded the towns. The migrant workers, who by and large settled in run-down boardinghouses, began participating in two extraordinary football programs. The public high schools in Belle Glade and Pahokee, located eight miles apart, have sent at least 60 players to the National Football League, including the five who will suit up today: for Baltimore, Anquan Boldin, Deonte Thompson, Damien Berry and Pernell McPhee; for San Francisco, Ray McDonald.
But even more extraordinary is the world that produced these players. Official unemployment in Belle Glade hovers around 16 percent, although the town's mayor believes it's closer to 40 percent. In the Glades, the ''official'' jobless rate has always been a joke because so few people are even on the books. Many of the agricultural jobs disappeared as vegetable production turned into sugar growing, now largely mechanized.
In 2010, the Palm Beach County sheriff's office estimated that half of the young men in Belle Glade between the ages of 18 and 25 had felony convictions. The town's migrant quarter resembles something on the outskirts of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, or Kampala in Uganda. Some families have recently resorted to catching rainwater to survive because their utilities have been cut off for nonpayment.
In the '80s, when the towns began exporting receivers and running backs to elite college programs far and wide, the region was notorious for having a very high AIDS rate. Drugs and shootings are inescapable.
In 2008, Norman Griffith, the captain of the Pahokee Blue Devils, was killed in a robbery after a game. In 2000, a linebacker for the Glades Central Raiders, Jyron Seider, was gunned down after a dice game.
In Muck City, the well-worn line that ''football is like religion'' doesn't even begin to convey its importance. Football is salvation itself, a fleeting window of escape from a place where prison or early death are real and likely outcomes.

Stupid German Tricks, Wearing Thin

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS KULISH; Victor Homola contributed reporting.

SECTION: Section AR; Column 0; Arts and Leisure Desk; Pg. 22

LENGTH: 1559 words

OFFENBURG, GERMANY -- The black telescoping arm of the Supertechno 30 camera crane swooped over the live television audience, as the scent of pyrotechnics from a Swedish band's performance lingered in the air. The Academy Award-winning actor Denzel Washington watched as a German man wearing goggles stuck his finger in a bottle and made a popping sound.
Mr. Washington clapped and offered encouragement as though he was back on the sidelines in ''Remember the Titans.'' He was urging on a young Bavarian, Bernhard Siegel, who was trying to guess from the plunking sound alone how much water was in a series of bottles, for glory, fleeting fame and the chance to win a brand-new car.
It was a recent Saturday night, and Mr. Washington, there to promote the film ''Flight,'' had entered the very German universe of ''Wetten, Dass ...?,'' a variety show with some 10 million viewers often referred to as the biggest television program in Europe. In more than three decades it has anchored itself in the German consciousness even as viewership has declined and criticism has risen, not just about the show but also about what it represents. 
Something of an amalgam of ''The Tonight Show,'' ''Saturday Night Live'' and ''Battle of the Network Stars,'' ''Wetten, Dass ...?'' -- which loosely translates as ''Want to bet that ...?'' -- began in February 1981, and the format, in which everyday people compete to execute strange ''bets,'' or feats, has changed little. Those wacky challenges, what David Letterman might call ''Stupid Human Tricks,'' remain the heart of a show that is a beloved but perpetually struggling German institution.
''Some people say that if anything could survive a nuclear strike, it would be cockroaches and 'Wetten, Dass ...?,' '' said its host, Markus Lanz, in an interview after the show wrapped. That survival has frequently been called into question recently. A handsome 43-year-old talk-show host, Mr. Lanz took over the show at a moment of crisis.
''Wetten, Dass ...?'' narrowly avoided cancellation after a tragic incident played out live. In December 2010 Samuel Koch, a young man on spring-loaded stilts, fell while jumping over an Audi driven by his father and was paralyzed from the neck down in front of millions of viewers.
The show's longtime and popular host, Thomas Gottschalk, quickly announced that the night's program would be suspended. During the next show he said that he would resign. Many thought the combination of the accident and his departure would spell the end of ''Wetten, Dass ...?''
Complicating matters further, the leading German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, reported last month that Mr. Gottschalk's brother may have had questionable business dealings with several companies whose products appeared on the show. That could amount to inappropriate advertising on state television. One of those products was Audi, whose cars were used as prizes and in the catastrophic gambit that paralyzed the young man.
''Wetten, Dass ...?'' is not produced by a private television network but by ZDF, one of the two main public stations, similar to the BBC in Britain. In 2011, the most recent year for which figures are available, German public television and radio received over $10 billion in licensing fees from viewers and listeners. Now the system is changing, and all households will have to contribute.
The hoary old show finds itself in the middle of a nationwide debate over whether the public is getting its money's worth. ''They hardly ever come up with anything that validates all the money pumped into this system,'' said Marc Felix Serrao, a journalist with the newspaper Sddeutsche Zeitung.
It's all part of a larger soul searching over why Germany, with great traditions in literature, theater and film, has mostly missed the current wave of challenging, complex television. Der Spiegel asked in its latest issue, ''Why are Germans the only ones sleeping through the future of TV?'' The magazine called German programs ''fainthearted, harmless, placebo television.''
''Wetten, Dass ...?'' has been swept up in the debate over the content of public television shows. ''On the one hand, they are supposed to produce artistically outstanding programs because that legitimizes funding and the reason for having public-service broadcasters,'' said Dominik Graf, a director whose series about the Russian mafia in Berlin, ''Im Angesicht des Verbrechens'' (''In the Face of Crime''), is often compared to ''The Wire.'' ''But on the other hand, the functionaries at film funds only talk about the viewership figures.''
The German television landscape is filled with reality shows including modeling and singing competitions. Newspapers meticulously track the goings-on in the jungle camp on the celebrity ''Survivor'' show ''I'm a Star, Get Me Out of Here.'' But the loudest criticism is usually reserved for ''Wetten, Dass ...?''
The broadsides reflect ''disappointed love'' from a generation weaned on the program, said Matthias Kalle, deputy editor in chief of the magazine at the weekly Die Zeit.
At its peak ''Wetten, Dass ...?'' could attract an almost unthinkable 23 million viewers. The popular coming-of-age novel ''Generation Golf,'' by Florian Illies, begins with a 12-year-old boy in a bathtub, looking forward to watching the show that night. ''Never again in later years would one have such a safe feeling of doing exactly the right thing at the right time,'' Mr. Illies writes.
Mr. Gottschalk began hosting in 1987 and established himself as one of biggest stars in Germany. With his frizzy blond mullet and outlandish suits he brought the off-kilter vibe of a Mad Hatter and the eccentricity of Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka to a mainstream television show. By contrast many critics have described Mr. Lanz as a dutiful, hardworking schoolboy.
Judged solely by the number of live audience members avidly taking photos, the show still has a strong pulse. ''I find the way he does it quite positive,'' Bernd Ruhlich, 47, said of Mr. Lanz. Mr. Ruhlich came with his wife, Beate, and their two children to watch the January edition of the show. (The show appears about seven times a year.)
The producers don't make it easy on themselves. Instead of presenting the program on the same soundstage, it's a roadshow. A crew of about 250 workers must build the set anew -- complete with 35 trucks filled with speakers, lights and dressing rooms -- in locations all over Germany and even abroad. The show is co-produced by ORF, the Austrian public broadcaster, and has also been staged in Majorca, Spain.
The latest stop in this ''wandering circus,'' in the words of one network employee, was a convention hall in this southwestern German city.
For English-speaking stars like Mr. Washington, there are translators talking into an earpiece. Every time he spoke, a disembodied voice echoed him in German, sometimes declaring ''ja'' or ''nein'' when he only nodded or shook his head.
The show can run longer than three hours. In November the actor Tom Hanks looked miserable in a hat with cat ears as Mr. Lanz hopped around him in a potato-sack race. ''In the United States if you are on a TV show that goes for four hours, everybody responsible for that show is fired the next day,'' Mr. Hanks told a radio station.
For Mr. Lanz those comments dealt a serious blow, much dissected in the German news media. Mr. Washington lampooned the fuss by donning the same hat before saying that it looked better on Mr. Hanks.
Mr. Washington may have been the biggest star of January's show, but Mr. Lanz was the hardest working personality. Over the course of the show he danced with a male guest in a tutu, lifting him several times. He competed against an audience member in a memory competition -- while both pulled on a rowing machine -- and won. A gargantuan contestant even demonstrated the elbow-drop wrestling move, leaping into the air and falling on a prone Mr. Lanz.
Mr. Lanz and Mr. Washington were joined onstage by a hulking Olympic discus gold medalist, a legend in the skiing-and-shooting biathlon and several German film and television stars. On a giant screen overhead a montage of movie clips showed the young film star Matthias Schweighצfer's bare backside.
Mr. Washington had a film to promote, and there are few better places to do that in Germany, which is Europe's largest economy. Mr. Lanz rolled clips of ''Flight,'' and Mr. Washington served pretzels to moviegoers at a nearby theater.
That same night the audience of ''Wetten, Dass ...?'' watched a young man execute flips on a treadmill and a masseur identify different massage oils in front of a flower-power set complete with Volkswagen bus. Probably the highlight of the evening was a forklift driver and his partner who picked up tiny two-cent coins using the vehicle's big metal forks and then dropped the money into a soda bottle.
''If only the Greeks were so careful with their money,'' Mr. Lanz said. The warehouse workers failed in their bet, getting only three of the required four coins into the bottle. Mr. Washington helped Mr. Siegel, the bottle plunker, and latest winner on ''Wetten, Dass ...?,'' into a brand-new Audi.
''Everyone knows it, everyone has an opinion about it, so there's a tendency to burden the state of 'Wetten, Dass ...?' at any given moment with a lot of meaning,'' Mr. Kalle, the Die Zeit editor, said. ''But it keeps going.''

The Most Wanted Gun in America

BYLINE: By NATASHA SINGER

SECTION: Section BU; Column 0; Money and Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 2498 words

PASADENA, Md.
THE phone rings again at Pasadena Pawn and Gun, and a familiar question comes down the line: ''Got any ARs?''
The answer is no. Pasadena Pawn and Gun, a gun retailer and pawnshop 15 miles south of Baltimore, is pretty much sold out of America's most wanted gun, the AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle. Since the massacre in Newtown, Conn., in December, the AR-15, the military-style weapon that the police say was used in the shootings, has been selling fast here and across the nation.
Before Newtown, the rifles sold for about $1,100, on average. Now some retailers charge twice that. At Pasadena Pawn, on the wall behind glass counters of handguns, are three dozen or so AR-15-style rifles. Dangling from nearly every one is a tag that says ''Sold.''
''The AR-15, it's kind of fashionable,'' says Frank Loane Sr., the proprietor. His shop has a revolving waiting list for the rifles, and a handful of people are now on it. ''The young generation likes them, the assault-looking guns.'' 
On one level, what is happening here and elsewhere simply reflects supply and demand. The gun industry has spent decades stoking demand for the AR-15 and rifles like it. Now, after the mass killings in Aurora, Colo., and Newtown, President Obama wants to reduce the supply. He has asked Congress for tougher controls, including a ban on what are commonly called ''military-style assault weapons''; the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on gun violence last Wednesday. Many enthusiasts are rushing to buy one of the rifles now, in case the president prevails.
But how did gun makers stir up the demand for these particular guns in the first place? The answer is a story of shrewd advertising, aggressive marketing and savvy manufacturing -- a virtual recasting of the place of guns in American life. With speed and skill, firearms manufacturers transformed a niche market for the AR-15 and similar rifles into a fast-growing profit center.
When certain rifles and features were banned under federal law from 1994 to 2004, gun makers tweaked their manufacturing specifications -- and introduced more AR-15-style rifles than ever. With ads celebrating the rifle's military connections, they lured a new and eager audience to weapons that, not long ago, few serious gun enthusiasts would buy.
It might seem remarkable, given the national conversation about gun control, but guns are a relatively small business in the United States. Sales of commercial guns and ammunition -- as opposed to those sold to the military and police -- amounted to about $5 billion in 2012. That's less than half of the profits that Apple earned in the final 13 weeks of last year. But despite the headlines, and partly because of them, commercial gun sales are growing. Last year, they were up 16 percent industrywide, according to estimates from the National Shooting Sports Foundation, an industry trade association. Semiautomatic rifles like the AR-15 are responsible for a significant share of that growth.
By now, many Americans probably recognize the AR-15, whether or not they recognize the term. Unlike its military counterpart, the M-16, the civilian AR-15 cannot spray a continuous stream of ammunition with one pull of the trigger. But, as a semiautomatic, it can fire individual bullets as fast as the trigger can be squeezed. By design, it looks and feels like something commandos might carry. That is part of its appeal, and of manufacturers' pitch.
On one level, marketing military-style weapons to civilians is not so different from pitching professional sports equipment to high-school athletes. Garry James, the senior field editor at Guns & Ammo, says a military pedigree inspires consumer confidence in a gun's reliability.
''Credibility of performance is what appeals to the firearms enthusiast,'' Mr. James wrote in an e-mail.
Yet marketing combat-derived weapons to civilians is a risky business, particularly now. The industry itself has promoted the guns by using battle imagery and words like ''assault'' and ''combat.'' Bushmaster Firearms, a leading maker of AR-15-style guns, and whose rifles have been used in several mass shootings, features the Bushmaster ACR, short for adaptive combat rifle, on its Web site. ''Forces of opposition, bow down,'' part of the site says. All the same, gun makers say customers buy these weapons with peaceable intentions.
The AR-15 isn't the first military-style weapon to gain a consumer following. After World War II, some people bought surplus German service rifles made by Mauser and repurposed them for hunting and competitive shooting. But the selling of the AR-15 represents the first mass marketing of a military-style semiautomatic rifle made by a number of different gun makers. Its success has led to an increasing militarization of the entire consumer firearms market, says Tom Diaz, a gun industry researcher and gun control advocate.
''It speaks to the fact that there are a lot of young men in the U.S. who will never be in the military but feel that male compulsion to warriorhood,'' says Mr. Diaz, the author of ''The Last Gun,'' a forthcoming book on the industry. ''Owning an assault weapon is a passport to that.''
A REMINGTON MODEL 870, a classic pump-action shotgun with an all-steel receiver and walnut stock, sits on a brown gingham tablecloth along with a slice of apple pie, a mug of coffee and an issue of the Old Farmer's Almanac.
This is how guns were marketed in 1981. That year, the Remington 870 was featured on the back cover of the July issue of Guns & Ammo, in an ad that emphasized quality and durability. ''The 870,'' the ad read. ''Still as American as apple pie.''
The front cover of the same issue showed something very different: a photograph of two gleaming black rifles, with the cover line: ''The New Breed of Assault Rifle.''
That breed's military antecedent, the M-16, developed by Colt, had been an American staple of the Vietnam War; soldiers had nicknamed it the ''black rifle'' for its anodized coating. But, by the 1980s, with the war ended and military orders waning, the industry was eager to find a market for the civilian AR-15. Many gun makers were under pressure as traditional customers like hunters were aging and young Americans were taking up other pursuits like computers and video games. Net domestic gun sales fell from more than five million guns in 1980 to fewer than four million in 1987, according to a report in 2000 from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
Some gun makers responded by advertising handguns for women. Others found success in adapting combat weapons for civilians. Colt, which had introduced an updated version of the M-16 for the military, began selling a similarly tweaked AR-15 for the consumer market. Some parts manufacturers started selling AR-15 parts to consumers who wanted to piece together their own rifles. Other companies imported semiautomatic Uzis, a version of the Israel Defense Force weapon, for civilian use.
The look and the gas-powered mechanisms of the new black rifles offended some gun enthusiasts, who viewed them as mere high-powered toys. Even magazines like Guns & Ammo, the Vogue of firearms, had to acknowledge the initial wariness of some readers.
''The dyed-in-the-wool deer hunter watching his domain being infiltrated by these black and gray guns assumes these 'new generation' hunters are merely fantasizing 'war games' and are playing 'soldier,' '' Art Blatt, a writer at Guns & Ammo, said in that 1981 issue. Mr. Blatt, now deceased, covered all types of firearms for the magazine and was himself a shotgun enthusiast.
But the gun media found ways to appeal to readers. In that 1981 article on the Colt AR-15 and similar firearms, Mr. Blatt invoked the rifles' military pedigree, ''spawned in the crucible of war.'' He spoke of their military-level durability, speed and accuracy. In a 1983 cover article on ''Bushmaster assault systems,'' he noted that in tests on a human-size silhouette target 10 yards away, a Bushmaster with a full 30-round magazine could be ''rapidly emptied into the lethal zone.''
The new rifles used ammunition -- .223 caliber -- that was considered too small for big-game hunting in most states. Before long, consumers were buying the guns for small game -- ''varmint hunting'' -- as well as recreational shooting called ''plinking.''
Some gun writers were not entirely comfortable with the rifles. In his article on Bushmaster, Mr. Blatt wrote that the guns seemed ''a mite too powerful and penetrating'' for home defense. He recommended the Bushmaster for police SWAT teams ''in close-quarter encounters with evildoers.''
Despite such reservations, the AR-15-style rifle -- which is fast, modern, ergonomically designed, relatively easy to handle and produces little recoil -- soon found a wide audience, be it Vietnam War veterans who had used the military version or first-time gun buyers.
''End users with minimal firearms exposure can learn to quickly become safe and proficient with the platform regardless of prior firearms experience,'' Mr. James, the editor at Guns & Ammo, wrote in an e-mail.
Another feature of the AR-15 is that it can be easily personalized and accessorized.
''You can take the whole gun apart and replace any part you want to without special tools, without knowing a whole lot,'' says Tim McDermott, a range officer at the Personal Defense and Handgun Safety Center in Raleigh, N.C. ''They are Legos for guys.''
IN 1976, Richard Dyke, a Korean War veteran, bought a bankrupt gun maker in Bangor, Me., for $241,000. That business grew into Bushmaster Firearms, which quickly earned a following after target shooters began winning competitions with its rifles.
''That did give us prestige,'' Mr. Dyke said in an interview with The New York Times in 2011. ''Then we won law-enforcement contracts and started getting recognition in the trade press.'' (Mr. Dyke later sold Bushmaster and started another gun company, Windham Weaponry. He declined to comment for this article).
Then, in 1994, the AR-15 hit a speed bump. Congress passed a 10-year ban on ''assault weapons,'' which legislators defined as semiautomatic rifles that included two or more specific features, like pistol-type handle grips and metal mounts, called bayonet lugs, to which bayonets could be attached. People who already owned such rifles were allowed to keep them.
The ban made the rifles only more desirable for some consumers. To meet the demand, gun makers removed prohibited features, like bayonet lugs, and marketed them as legal alternatives.
''It was unfortunately an industrywide event where companies were openly bragging about their ability to sell guns in circumvention of the law,'' says Josh Sugarmann, executive director of the Violence Policy Center, a research and gun-control advocacy group in Washington.
The industry produced an estimated one million modified AR-15-style rifles during the ban -- more than it had produced of the original version in the previous decade -- says Gary G. Mehalik, a former marketing executive at the National Shooting Sports Foundation and at Taurus USA, a handgun maker in Miami. He denied that gun makers circumvented the law.
''If you drive 40 miles an hour in a 40-mile-an-hour zone, are you exploiting a loophole or following the law?'' Mr. Mehalik asked.
After the ban's expiration, gun makers simply restored the once-prohibited features. Some companies added muscle to the rifles -- to enthusiastic reviews in the gun media.
''Scoffed at for being a 'poodle shooter,' the AR has grown fangs and is now available in a variety of calibers including big bores,'' said an article in Guns & Ammo in 2005. ''Today's ARs ride in an increasing number of patrol cars,'' the article said, adding that the guns' military counterparts ''are turning live terrorists into dead ones in Iraq and Afghanistan.''
Combat allusions increased in ads as well. In a 2008 issue of Guns & Ammo, an ad for Stag Arms, a leading AR-15-style rifle and parts maker, showed a photo of two policemen wearing bulletproof vests and helmets, carrying the black rifles. ''Stag Arms rifles meet the highest standards of engineering precision and reliability,'' the ad said. ''Just ask these guys.''
An article about Stag Arms in the same issue described one of the company's models as ''a southpaw's dream'' and invoked ''the role this rifle plays in combat.''
Mark Malkowski, the president of Stag Arms, declined to comment.
Mr. James, of Guns & Ammo, said his magazine devoted many articles to AR-15-style rifles because manufacturers over time had improved the guns and introduced a variety of accessories, thereby attracting readers' attention.
''Guns & Ammo's role in popularizing the platform is purely a function of reader interest and the platform's unique adaptability for a wide range of sporting purposes,'' Mr. James wrote.
Pressured by investors in the wake of Newtown, Cerberus Capital Management, a private investment firm that bought Bushmaster from Mr. Dyke and has built the nation's largest gun company, the Freedom Group, announced that it would sell its gun interests. It has yet to find a buyer.
A WOMAN wearing mirrored aviator sunglasses and a make-my-day smirk aims a hefty black semiautomatic Benelli rifle at an unseen predator. ''This baby handles prairie varmints or the kind that come uninvited through your door,'' the Benelli Web site says of the rifle. ''Chosen by the United States Marine Corps.''
Gun makers seem to be competing to roll out the next civilianized combat weapon. Today, one trendsetter in handguns is a new generation of semiautomatic pistols with large-capacity magazines and other features. An ad for a pistol from Taurus USA promoted it as ''the extreme-duty next-generation handgun, created for Special Operations Personnel.''
Such marketing aside, the industry disavows a link between military-style guns and gun violence. Industry representatives, like the National Rifle Association, often fault news outlets for demonizing and mislabeling the rifles.
''As you should know, but your non-gun-owning friends probably don't, the guns our opponents call 'assault weapons' are not 'high-powered' when compared to other firearms,'' Chris W. Cox, the executive director of the N.R.A.'s Institute for Legislative Action, wrote in a 2009 article in American Rifleman, a monthly N.R.A. publication.
Some marketing executives take a different view, suggesting that the industry include warnings the way alcohol and cigarette ads do. In a blog post last month on Adage.com titled ''In a Culture of Mass Shootings, the Ad Industry Shares the Blame,'' David Morse, a contributor, recommended that gun makers develop ''more responsible ways'' to present their products.
''Should we be holding manufacturers accountable?'' Mr. Morse, the C.E.O. of New American Dimensions, a multicultural marketing research firm, asked in a phone interview. ''The marketing messages do share in the blame because the messages are picked up and misinterpreted by the wrong kind of people.''

Hope and Fear Mix as a Hostage Situation Drags On

MIDLAND CITY, Ala. -- The vigils continued in and around this southeastern Alabama town on Saturday. They were held in private homes, at the gazebo next to City Hall and, perhaps most somberly, on the grassy hill where swarms of federal agents were watching the underground bunker where, they said, a man named Jimmy Lee Dykes had held a 5-year-old boy hostage for more than four days.
Law enforcement officials were still saying little about attempts to rescue the boy, who was kidnapped on Tuesday when Mr. Dykes raided a school bus and killed the driver. Officials have been in constant contact with Mr. Dykes via cellphone. And they have passed things to him through a plastic pipe that, a neighbor said, was originally installed to allow Mr. Dykes to eavesdrop on trespassers from within the bunker. 
The bunker had food and electricity, and Sheriff Wally Olson of Dale County said in a news conference on Saturday that it also had blankets and an electric heater to get through the near-freezing temperatures at night. He added that toys, coloring books, potato chips and medication had been passed into the bunker for the boy, who has Asperger's syndrome and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
He did not say if it was known whether the boy had been taking the medicine.
''It's one thing when you've got your mother and grandmother giving it to you every day,'' said Steve Clouse, a state representative whose district includes Midland City.
Perhaps suggesting that Mr. Dykes was following events from his bunker, Sheriff Olson concluded the short news conference by offering gratitude to Mr. Dykes for allowing officials to pass on such necessities.
''I want to thank him for taking care of our child,'' the sheriff said. ''It's very important.''
The Daily Mail of London reported on Saturday that Mr. Dykes had initially made a request to local authorities that he deliver his grievances to a reporter in exchange for handing over the boy. Two people familiar with the early hours of the operation corroborated The Daily Mail's account, one adding that Mr. Dykes even had a particular reporter in mind.
Neighbors described Mr. Dykes as perpetually either threatening others or seeing himself as under threat, his interactions with them limited to conspiratorial tirades against the government or warnings of violence, sometimes by brandishing a gun.
''He told us it was his land and anybody that went onto it would be killed,'' said Ronda Wilbur, 55, who lives next to Mr. Dykes and said he once had beaten her dog with a lead pipe after it walked onto his property.
Before federal agents were stationed on his property and the national news media was camped out across the street, Mr. Dykes spoke in paranoid tones about surveillance and the government, neighbors said.
''He was more and more antigovernment, antipolice, anti-everything,'' said Ms. Wilbur's husband, John Wilbur, 59.
Mr. Dykes, who has lived in a travel trailer here for about two years, has a troubled past, including arrests on charges connected to drugs, drunken driving and, in Florida in 1995, unlawful display of a firearm. On Wednesday he was due in court in this county, accused of shooting at a neighbor in a dispute over driving on his property.
But the most telling indications of his troubles may lie outside the official record.
At midnight, when people would come home from late shifts, Mr. Dykes would be digging with a shovel in the red clay behind his trailer. Or he would be on patrol, walking the perimeter of his compound with a flashlight and a long gun.
Before building the bunker, Mr. Dykes made long, snaking mounds out of dirt and odd structures out of cinder blocks. He built the bunker in about three months, said a neighbor, Michael Creel, 28, who described it as four to five feet wide by six feet long, made of plywood and lined with plastic insulation and sandbags.
Mr. Creel said he was admiring Mr. Dykes's okra bed one day when Mr. Dykes invited him to see the bunker. ''It kind of threw me off the first time I climbed down in there,'' he said. ''He said: 'Climb down in there and holler. See if we can hear you.' That was a little bit of a red flag.''
Mr. Creel said he believed that Mr. Dykes had several handguns, including an antique Colt .45, as well as a rifle and a shotgun. Other neighbors said they had heard Mr. Dykes firing what sounded like a semiautomatic weapon in the field behind his property.
Mr. Creel's father, Greg, said he had been subpoenaed to appear in the case involving the dispute with the neighbor. He said Mr. Dykes had given him a handwritten letter several pages long, presumably in connection with the trial.
Mr. Creel, 65, said he had not wanted to read the letter and had handed it over to law enforcement. ''I am sure it gives insight to this man's crazed mentality,'' he said.
Meanwhile, people in town continued to gather each night at a gazebo on the grounds of City Hall, where they held candles in salt-filled plastic cups. Friday night's vigil began with announcements: a reminder to eat at the local Ruby Tuesday, which was making donations to the family.
A mother of one of the boy's classmates spoke. There were prayers, for the family of the bus driver, Charles Albert Poland Jr., 66; for the boy and his family; even for Mr. Dykes.
They closed, as usual, with a chorus of ''Amazing Grace,'' and then resumed the long wait.

Iceland, Fervent Prosecutor of Bankers, Sees Meager Returns

BYLINE: By ANDREW HIGGINS

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 6

LENGTH: 1594 words

REYKJAVIK, Iceland -- As chief of police in a tiny fishing town for 11 years, Olafur Hauksson developed what he thought was a basic understanding of the criminal mind. The typical lawbreaker, he said, recalling his many encounters with small-time criminals, ''clearly knows that he crossed the line'' and generally sees ''the difference between right and wrong.''
Today, the burly, 48-year-old former policeman is struggling with a very different sort of suspect. Reassigned to Reykjavik, the Icelandic capital, to lead what has become one of the world's most sweeping investigation into the bankers whose actions contributed to the global financial crisis in 2008, Mr. Hauksson now faces suspects who ''are not aware of when they crossed the line'' and ''defend their actions every step of the way.''
With the global economy still struggling to recover from the financial maelstrom five years ago, governments around the world have been criticized for largely failing to punish the bankers who were responsible for the calamity. But even here in Iceland, a country of just 320,000 that has gone after financiers with far more vigor than the United States and other countries hit by the crisis, obtaining criminal convictions has proved devilishly difficult. 
Public hostility toward bankers is so strong in Iceland that ''it is easier to say you are dealing drugs than to say you're a banker,'' said Thorvaldur Sigurjonsson, the former head of trading for Kaupthing, a once high-flying bank that crumbled. He has been called in for questioning by Mr. Hauksson's office but has not been charged with any wrongdoing.
Yet, in the four years since the Icelandic Parliament passed a law ordering the appointment of an unnamed special prosecutor to investigate those blamed for the country's spectacular meltdown in 2008, only a handful of bankers have been convicted.
Ministers in a left-leaning coalition government elected after the crash agree that the wheels of justice have ground slowly, but they call for patience, explaining that the process must follow the law, not vengeful passions.
''We are not going after people just to satisfy public anger,'' said Steingrimur J. Sigfusson, Iceland's minister of industry, a former finance minister and leader of the Left-Green Movement that is part of the governing coalition.
Hordur Torfa, a popular singer-songwriter who helped organize protests that forced the previous conservative government to resign, acknowledged that ''people are getting impatient'' but said they needed to accept that ''this is not the French Revolution. I don't believe in taking bankers out and hanging them or shooting them.''
Others are less patient. ''The whole process is far too slow,'' said Thorarinn Einarsson, a left-wing activist. ''It only shows that 'banksters' can get away with doing whatever they want.''
Mr. Hauksson, the special prosecutor, said he was frustrated by the slow pace but thought it vital that his office scrupulously follow legal procedure. ''Revenge is not something we want as our main driver in this process. Our work must be proper today and be seen as proper in the future,'' he said.
Part of the difficulty in prosecuting bankers, he said, is that the law is often unclear on what constitutes a criminal offense in high finance. ''Greed is not a crime,'' he noted. ''But the question is: where does greed lead?''
Mr. Hauksson said it was often easy to show that bankers violated their own internal rules for lending and other activities, but ''as in all cases involving theft or fraud, the most difficult thing is proving intent.''
And there are the bankers themselves. Those who have been brought in for questioning often bristle at being asked to account for their actions. ''They are not used to being questioned. These people are not used to finding themselves in this situation,'' Mr. Hauksson said. They also hire expensive lawyers.
The special prosecutor's office initially had only five staff members but now has more than 100 investigators, lawyers and financial experts, and it has relocated to a big new office. It has opened about 100 cases, with more than 120 people now under investigation for possible crimes relating to an Icelandic financial sector that grew so big it dwarfed the rest of the economy.
To help ease Mr. Hauksson's task, legislators amended the law to allow investigators easy access to confidential bank information, something that previously required a court order.
Parliament also voted to put the country's prime minister at the time of the banking debacle on trial for negligence before a special tribunal. (A proposal to try his cabinet failed.) Mr. Hauksson was not involved in the case against the former leader, Geir H. Haarde, who last year was found guilty of failing to keep ministers properly informed about the 2008 crisis but was acquitted on more serious charges that could have resulted in a prison sentence.
Meanwhile, an investigative commission appointed by Parliament first reported to it in April 2010 and later published a nine-volume account of the financial crash, including a study of what philosophers charged with investigating ethical issues behind the crisis called a ''moral void'' at the heart of Icelandic finance.
Vilhjalmur Arnason, a philosophy professor at Iceland University who worked on the study, described the exercise as ''very important for reasons of justice and for reconciliation'' in a society traumatized by a crash so severe that it threatened to capsize the country. But, he added, bankers alone were not responsible, as ''the whole society was so intoxicated'' by values that put profit ahead of morality, the law and even common sense.
After the crash, the new government pushed to restructure the failed banks, purging their former management and owners and prodding them to write off a big chunk of their loans to homeowners burdened with big mortgages. The government declined to bail out foreign bondholders, who lost about $85 billion. Iceland now has a growing economy.
But it is not entirely clear that Iceland deserves its reputation as a warrior against Wall Street orthodoxy. In time, Iceland won praise from the International Monetary Fund for sharp cuts in spending and tax increases that slashed the government's deficit and helped put the country back on an even keel.
Certainly Iceland, in contrast to the United States and most other countries, has pursued not only little-known financiers but also many of the country's biggest names in banking and business. ''We have been aiming at the upper levels rather than the lower levels,'' Mr. Hauksson said.
His biggest scalp so far is that of Larus Welding, the former chief executive of Glitnir, one of the trio of banks that failed in 2008. Mr. Welding and a second former Glitnir executive were found guilty of fraud over a $70 million loan to a company that owned shares in the bank.
Mr. Welding, who is now standing trial in a second case along with one of the country's most prominent business tycoons, Jon Asgeir Johannesson, was sentenced in December to nine months in prison, six of which were suspended.
The light sentence enraged many Icelanders, but, Mr. Hauksson said, ''the important thing is that we got a conviction.'' By contrast in Ireland, which put taxpayers on the hook for tens of billions of dollars owed by failed banks, the former chief of the failed Anglo Irish Bank has been charged with financial irregularities but so far no senior bank executive has yet been found guilty of a crime.
Prosecuting bankers was never going to be easy, particularly in a country like Iceland, which is so small that nearly everybody in the capital has a friend or family member who worked at one time in finance. When Iceland's Justice Ministry first advertised for applicants for the new post of special prosecutor, nobody responded.
Mr. Hauksson, an outsider with no network of friends and relatives in Reykjavik, was then urged to apply during a second attempt to fill the post and was given the job.
''I thought this was something that had to be looked into,'' Mr. Hauksson said. ''If we prosecute small cases we also have to look into big cases.'' But, he added, this risks ''opening up a Pandora's box'' that can escalate even relatively simple cases ''into something very big.''
The high stakes have also left some investigators vulnerable to temptation: two former members of Mr. Hauksson's staff were placed under criminal investigation last year for selling confidential information for 30 million Icelandic krona (around $233,000) to the administrator of a bankrupt company who was trying to locate missing assets.
That episode has not dented Iceland's heroic image among antibanker campaigners abroad. Mr. Sigfusson, the minister of industry, said he was regularly invited to speak on how Iceland dealt with its banking crisis. Iceland, he said, has ''no magic solution'' but has managed to push through unpopular cuts in spending in part because it managed to curb public anger by pushing for the prosecution of its bankers.
Today, Iceland's bankers are both mocked for their recklessness during the boom years and reviled for pushing the country to the brink of economic ruin.
Mr. Sigurjonsson, the former Kaupthing banker, said a ''big umbrella of suspicion'' has opened up over anybody who worked in finance and unfairly stigmatized ''highly educated and very able people who can lend a hand in resurrecting the country.''
He said he was shocked recently when he heard the young daughter of a friend, also a former banker, ask, ''Daddy, why are bankers all criminals?''

Mates in Peril, Actress in Clover

'The Man Who Knew Too Much'
ALFRED HITCHCOCK DIRECTED over 50 feature films but chose to remake only one: the 1934 British production ''The Man Who Knew Too Much,'' which he reshot in Hollywood in 1956. The '34 version has recently been released by the Criterion Collection in a magnificent restoration from the British Film Institute, and it remains a fine piece of entertainment, a swift and witty action adventure that helped to establish Hitchcock's international reputation.
But perfectionist that he was, Hitchcock must have realized that the first draft left some room for improvement. Often cited as the first of Hitchcock's globe-trotting spy thrillers, a format he would revisit periodically for decades to come, it is also part of a less-noticed cycle within Hitchcock's work: films centered on marriages and the careful negotiations necessary to ensure their survival. It was a theme that Hitchcock explored in a range of tones and with varying degrees of optimism, from ''Rich and Strange'' (1931) through ''Marnie'' (1964). 
In the first ''Man Who Knew Too Much,'' a British couple (Leslie Banks and Edna Best) are vacationing in St. Moritz, Switzerland, when they are drawn into a plot to assassinate a foreign dignitary visiting London. To prevent the couple from telling the British Secret Service what they know, the conspirators (including Peter Lorre, in his first English-speaking role) kidnap the couple's young daughter. While most of the action is carried by the husband, who sets out looking for his daughter on his own, it is the wife who ultimately steps forward, when the situation calls for her skills as a champion sharpshooter.
The remake delves much more deeply and perceptively into the tensions within the couple, generated by the insistence of the husband (James Stewart, as an autocratic doctor) that his wife (Doris Day) abandon her career as a singer. In the end the wife again saves the day, but this time by exercising the art she has been forbidden to practice -- with Ms. Day emerging as one Hitchcock blonde who is neither remote nor a victim.
Hitchcock made a ghoulish black humor the center of his public persona, but in his films death is seldom if ever treated as a joke. The first ''Man Who Knew Too Much'' climaxes with an extended gun battle of the kind generally played today for slapsticky sight gags. Hitchcock's staging of the siege, however, is solemn in tone and paced to a slow, sputtering rhythm that short-circuits the kind of giddy catharsis we are offered at the end of, for example, Quentin Tarantino's ''Django Unchained.''
In this Hitchcock film those who get shot, both good guys and bad, crumple in a kind of quiet disbelief, and each casualty is individually registered. When the smoke has cleared and a handful of policemen enter the apartment where the foreign agents were holed up, Hitchcock (in a rare gesture of empathy toward representatives of the law) cuts in to their astonished expressions, as they survey the (unshown) carnage, mouths open in silent horror. Here is one component of Hitchcock's greatness: He never loses his moral compass. (Criterion Collection; Blu-ray, $39.95; DVD, $29.95; not rated)
'Carole Lombard in the Thirties'
There aren't any major revelations in ''Carole Lombard in the Thirties,'' a three-disc set from the TCM Vault Collection that offers three early Lombard performances for Columbia Pictures. But the films here -- Walter Lang's 1932 society drama ''No More Orchids'' and two features directed by the little-known (and not conspicuously talented) David Burton, ''Brief Moment'' from 1933 and ''Lady by Choice'' from 1934 -- do contribute to an understanding of Lombard's development as an artist, as she slowly made her way toward a limber, knowing performance style that seems, if anything, more fresh and appealing with each passing year.
For Lombard it would all finally come together under the insightful direction of Howard Hawks (her second cousin!) in the brilliant 1934 screwball comedy ''Twentieth Century.'' Yet far from being the ''virtual beginner'' described in Todd McCarthy's 1997 biography of Hawks, Lombard had been in the movies since the age of 12, playing bit roles and walk-ons in over two-dozen films (including Hawks's now-lost debut feature, the 1926 ''Road to Glory''), before she was promoted to the female lead in Howard Higgin's 1929 ''High Voltage.''
Lombard starred in another 22 features before ''Twentieth Century,'' moving between Paramount and Columbia as she experimented with different looks and different personalities. Her early, eyeliner-heavy vamp style can still be seen in ''No More Orchids,'' in which she plays a spoiled heiress brought down to earth by a poor-but-honest suitor (Lyle Talbot).
Lombard's cool, blond beauty and fashion runway bearing led her to many similar roles in the class-conscious melodramas of the early years of the Great Depression. But at the same time she possessed a ribald sense of humor and a no-nonsense sexuality that lent itself to good-hearted streetwalkers and nightclub queens. The rather starchy ''Brief Moment,'' based on a Broadway play by S. N. Behrman, reverses the roles of ''No More Orchids.'' Here she's the supper-club singer whose love reforms a wealthy wastrel (Gene Raymond).
Hawks's stroke of genius in ''Twentieth Century'' lay in the realization that the two sides of Lombard's screen persona were not contradictory but natural complements. As the Katherine Cornell-like Broadway diva Lily Garland (nיe Mildred Plotka), Lombard is both regal and one of the boys, a self-composed, aristocratic beauty who isn't afraid of taking a pratfall or telling a dirty joke.
Released six months after ''Twentieth Century,'' ''Lady by Choice'' finds Lombard already internalizing that insight. She plays Alabam Lee, a fan dancer billed as the Human Heatwave, who, for a publicity stunt, ''adopts'' a cantankerous old woman (May Robson, extending her Oscar-nominated performance in Frank Capra's 1934 ''Lady for a Day''). Under Robson's guidance (she's a former Broadway star fallen on hard times) Lombard struggles to remake herself as a Great Lady of the Theater. The MGM version would probably have ended with Alabam's triumph as Lady Macbeth, but at scrappy Columbia more pragmatic outcomes were possible -- as Alabam reclaims her fans and in so doing, the society lawyer (the undeserving Roger Pryor) she loves.

So, How'd He Do?

Ed Koch, the blunt-spoken and theatrical three-term mayor of New York City, who became a national emblem for the way New Yorkers talk and behave, often asked straphangers at subway stops to assess his record with a ''How'm I doin'?''
With his death on Friday at 88, it seemed only fitting to ask that question once more -- in retrospect.
There is no doubt that Mr. Koch restored the spirit of the city after years of urban decay that had crystallized in the city's near bankruptcy, and that reached a nadir of sorts in 1977 with the Son of Sam killings, a blackout and riots. Mr. Koch, a Democrat, took office in January 1978 and, with his moxie, was able to quickly create a sense among New Yorkers that someone was fighting to turn the city around. 
''The city needed hope, it needed a champion, it needed a voice,'' said Mitchell Moss, a professor of urban policy at New York University. ''Ed Koch became that voice.''
Even the Rev. Calvin O. Butts III, the pastor of Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, who tangled frequently with Mr. Koch over what he felt was the mayor's insensitivity to African-Americans, said Mr. Koch was the right mayor for his time.
''If you've got to have a mayor for New York City, you need a guy like Ed Koch because he's a rough-and-tumble kind of guy who speaks up and fights back,'' he said.
The Koch-era legacy is substantial. Experts cite the investment of billions of dollars in rebuilding abandoned housing, which revived desolate areas of the South Bronx, Harlem and central Brooklyn; the restoration of the city's fiscal integrity to the point where banks and government watchdogs were ready to let it manage its own finances; the rehabilitation of neglected parks; the genesis of Times Square's transformation from a sleazy, dangerous crossroads to a family-friendly entertainment and office center; the trading in of federal money designated to build a new West Side Highway for money that would buy subway trains and buses; the pressure on the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to virtually eliminate subway graffiti; and the enacting of a campaign finance law in 1988 under which candidates would limit their spending in exchange for receiving public matching funds.
On the ledger's deficit side, experts say Mr. Koch needlessly antagonized African-American New Yorkers and allowed his reputation for let-the-chips-fall-where-they-may integrity to be tarnished by corruption scandals that started in the Parking Violations Bureau and raised questions about his alliances with political bosses. Together, those failures might have cost him a fourth term.
While opinions about the former mayor may vary, there is no doubt he left a notable mark in several areas.
HOUSING
To grasp the scope of Mr. Koch's accomplishment, consider the visit that President Jimmy Carter made in 1977 to the South Bronx, where he stood with Mayor Abraham D. Beame in a rubble-strewed patch of Charlotte Street against a backdrop of ghostly, gutted buildings. That characteristic landscape changed dramatically starting in 1986 with a 10-year plan by Mr. Koch that led to the spending of more than $5 billion on building low- and moderate-income housing and on rehabilitating vacant buildings. The program eventually created more than 150,000 affordable apartments, according to Ted Houghton, executive director of the Supportive Housing Network of New York. Charlotte Street itself was turned into a row of suburban-style ranch houses that a few years ago were selling for $500,000 apiece. There are few lots in the Bronx that sit empty anymore.
''When you walk through today's vibrant neighborhoods in Harlem, Bed-Stuy and the South Bronx, thank Ed Koch,'' Mr. Houghton said in an e-mail. ''If it wasn't for his 10-year housing plan, we'd still be looking at acres and acres of abandoned buildings, like one continues to see in a lot of less fortunate, older Eastern cities.''
PARKS
In the years before Mr. Koch became mayor, many of the city's signature parks had gone to seed -- partly as a result of lack of money, but also because of a poorly administered and patronage-ridden bureaucracy. Central Park had become so dangerous it was ridiculed by late-night comedians.
''In the Koch administration, the parks took on an elevated position that they hadn't really had since the Robert Mosesera,'' said Holly Leicht, executive director of New Yorkers for Parks.
Parks commissioners like Gordon J. Davis and Henry J. Sternde centralized their department, delegating more authority to officials in the boroughs and appointing new parks administrators for Central Park and Prospect Park. Those administrators ultimately cobbled together public-private partnerships that have rejuvenated both parks. The Sheep Meadow, virtually a dust bowl when Koch took office, was turned into a green carpet, and the crumbling Bethesda Fountain into an aesthetic jewel. Adrian Benepe, who was a park ranger when Mr. Koch took office and eventually became the commissioner under Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, said a key moment was ''having Simon and Garfunkel do a concert in Central Park in the early '80s, because it showed that Central Park was safe and fun at night.''
CRIME
Mr. Koch's record on crime is more mixed. A few years into his tenure, crime began to recede, with murders declining to 1,386 in 1985 from 1,818 in 1980. Jeremy Travis, president of John Jay College of Criminal Justice, who was a special adviser to Mr. Koch during his third term, said gains were made by techniques like concentrating police personnel on open-air drug markets where people were brazenly lining up to buy drugs. But the unseen rise of the crack cocaine epidemic in the mid-1980s led to a resurgence, as easy profits enticed many amateurs into drug dealing and neighborhood wars broke out. The administration's response was ''heroic,'' Mr. Travis said, but hobbled by understaffing in the Police Department -- about 26,000 officers at the time -- as a result of the layoffs demanded by the 1970s fiscal crisis.
''If you dialed 911, you couldn't get a car to the scene in time,'' Mr. Travis said. ''An under-resourced department is not effective in fighting crime.''
By 1990, the year after Mr. Koch left office, murders hit a historic peak of 2,251. The situation did not begin to be reversed until the city hired 5,000 more officers late in the administration of Mayor David N. Dinkins. Another form of crime, corruption, was spawned in Mr. Koch's Parking Violations Bureau. There were no revelations suggesting that Mr. Koch personally profited, but the scandals left a stain because they indicated he was sometimes willing to make patronage appointments to sustain the backing of Democratic bosses like Meade H. Esposito, Donald R. Manes and Stanley M. Friedman.
HEALTH
Larry Kramer, the gay rights advocate who wrote the play ''The Normal Heart"about the AIDS epidemic, recently accused Mr. Koch of ignoring the disease's spread in a city with a large gay population because ''he was terrified everyone would find out he was gay and he would lose his support from the real estate industry.'' Mr. Kramer said Mr. Koch did not ''tell people to change their behavior'' and refused to meet with or finance gay activists. (Though he once responded to a questioner that he was heterosexual, Mr. Koch repeatedly said that his love life was nobody's business but his own.)
Stanley Brezenoff, the chief executive officer of Continuum Health Partners and a former deputy mayor under Mr. Koch, offered a different picture of Mr. Koch's response to the AIDS epidemic. ''It took a long time to recognize what was going on,'' Mr. Brezenoff said, ''and as we came to grips with it we became more focused on identifying concrete steps to take.'' Mr. Koch, he said, agonized over a step like closing bathhouses used for promiscuous sex because it meant having to dispatch ''investigators into bathhouses and spying on people in their most private moments.''
One health policy decision Mr. Koch came to regret was the closing -- for reasons of poor performance -- of Sydenham Hospital in Harlem. Mr. Koch said in recent years that he had not fully appreciated how important the hospital was to black doctors, who often had trouble receiving admitting privileges elsewhere.
Mr. Brezenoff, who was president of the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation from 1981 to 1982, credited Mr. Koch for spurring ''the renaissance'' of the agency, which had been in disarray, and for focusing its mission on primary care.
RACE RELATIONS
From the beginning, Mr. Koch frequently found himself at loggerheads with black ministers and politicians. The Sydenham closing stirred enormous resentment in Harlem. So did Mr. Koch's abrasive style, which led him to call antipoverty organizers who were abusing the system ''poverty pimps.'' He might also have realized that more than a few of his white supporters appreciated such tough talk.
''He was a politician and he knew what crowd he had to play to,'' Mr. Butts, pastor of Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, said.
But David R. Jones, president of the Community Service Society of New York and a former Koch adviser, pointed out that Mr. Koch assembled the most diverse team of deputies and commissioners City Hall had ever seen, includingBasil A. Paterson,Herman Badillo and Mr. Jones. Later, he appointed Benjamin Ward as the city's first black police commissioner.
Mr. Koch also suffered because of racially charged episodes that sprang up on his watch: the 1984 shooting death of a 66-year-old black woman, Eleanor Bumpurs, by a white police officer during an eviction; the 1986 beating of three black men by a white gang in Howard Beach, Queens; the shooting death of Yusuf K. Hawkins by white youths weeks before the 1989 election.
Despite his condemnation of the mob beatings, it was hard to tamp down a sense among blacks that his public rhetoric -- in the 1988 presidential campaign, for example, he said Jews would be ''crazy'' to vote for Jesse Jacksonbecause of his ''Hymietown'' slur about New York and his support for a Palestinian homeland -- may have helped foster an atmosphere in which some young whites felt emboldened to commit such assaults.
Still, Mr. Koch seemed to redeem himself in his post-mayoralty. The Rev.Al SharptonJr. became a friend, and Mr. Butts, who once said Mr. Koch was ''worse than a racist, he was an opportunist,'' said last week: ''I never got the impression that he was a racist. He had his prejudices like everybody else and he allowed his temper and his I-know-what's-best-for-everybody attitude to get in the way of sound judgment.''
TRANSIT
With its graffiti-coated subway cars and frequent breakdowns, the transit system Mr. Koch inherited had become one of the bleakest symbols of the city's tailspin. Ridership had fallen to its lowest level since 1917, even before the modern subway system had been completed, according to Gene Russianoff, staff attorney for the Straphangers Campaign.
While he had few direct powers to change matters, Mr. Koch harangued the Transportation Authority for its crackling, inaudible announcements; doubled, to $200 million, the city's contribution for rebuilding; and urged that dogs patrol the subway yards, an idea that was barely tried. While originally a proponent of the West Side Highway, Mr. Koch eventually fought for trading in the federal highway funds for $1 billion to buy new subway cars. The last graffiti-marked car was taken out of service in his last year in office.

A Friend, in Need and Deed

BYLINE: By LISA PREVOST

SECTION: Section RE; Column 0; Real Estate Desk; LIVING IN | MONROE, CONN.; Pg. 7

LENGTH: 1313 words

The town of Monroe has for a long time been intertwined with Newtown, its Fairfield County neighbor to the north -- the way towns that share a border often are. Residents of each have regularly crossed town lines without giving it much thought, heading to church, dropping off children at day care, or rushing to make tee time.
The nature of the relationship abruptly intensified in mid-December, on the day a young man forced his way into the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown and shot to death 20 children and 6 school employees. The voids left by the shootings also gaped in Monroe, where everybody seemed to know somebody in Newtown who had been affected. For Steve Vavrek, Monroe's first selectman, the ordeal amplified the towns' connection as never before.
''We found out how close we are,'' said Mr. Vavrek, who has lived in Monroe for 26 years. ''My wife works for Monroe Pediatrics, and they lost five children that day.'' 
Monroe responded by offering up an empty school building to serve temporarily for the surviving Sandy Hook children. The building comes rent-free -- Newtown must simply cover the utilities and other interior costs.
Residents also held a fundraiser at the Waterview banquet facility, on the Monroe side of Lake Zoar. It sold out, raising some $50,000 for the victims' families. ''The owner donated the food,'' said Davinder Heslin, one of the organizers. ''Someone donated alcohol; the band played for free. At the end of the night, the staff had $1,400 in tips, and they even donated that.''
One of many small salves to the devastation wrought by the school shootings, the old-fashioned neighborliness that has been on such full display in Monroe in recent weeks reflects a slightly more tranquil ambience than in the faster-paced Gold Coast towns to the south.
And if tranquillity is one draw, so too are real estate prices more affordable than in lower Fairfield County. ''People come here to get more house,'' said Marie Spanbauer, an agent with William Raveis Real Estate and a longtime Monroe resident.
That was true of Ms. Heslin and her husband, Jack, when they moved with their young son from Trumbull in 2008. Then commuting, respectively, to Fairfield and across the New York border to White Plains, they had hoped to stay in Trumbull, but learned they could get more land in Monroe. They bought what has come to be the quintessential Monroe property, a four-bedroom colonial on an acre, for $490,000.
Shortly after that, the stock market crashed and home values dipped precipitously. But they appear to be recovering: Monroe's current median sale price of $384,900 is up about 5.5 percent from the 2011 median, according to William Raveis.
Buyers here won't find the plethora of cultural events and dining options available in pricier towns like Fairfield and Westport. Life in Monroe tends to revolve around the schools and outdoor recreation. Single-family homes on large lots set the tone, as the absence of public sewer lines limits density. Lot size is typically one to three acres. Rentals are scarce, accounting for fewer than 7 percent of all housing units.
''We cater to families,'' Ms. Spanbauer said. ''Someone who is single, without kids, is not attracted to Monroe.''
What You'll Find
Covering 26 square miles, Monroe is about 75 percent developed, according to the town's Plan of Conservation and Development. The population has remained fairly static over the last decade, hovering just below 20,000.
Most housing was built after 1940. Ranches, split-levels and colonials abound, but Cape Cods do not, Ms. Spanbauer noted. High-end subdivisions, with newer colonials sited irregularly on hilly terrain, are on the western side of town, which has had more available land and is near Route 25, a commuter thoroughfare. Roughly 250 homes dating to the 1980s are clustered around the 18-hole Whitney Farms Golf Course, a public course closer to the center of town. Historic properties can be found in Monroe Center, a designated historic district distinguished by a green and an Episcopal church dating to Thomas Jefferson's presidency.
Rather than a concentrated commercial center, Monroe has long expanses of strip malls and shopping plazas along Routes 25 and 111. Independently owned businesses, like Dr. Mike's Ice Cream and the newly opened Monroe Diner, maintain a strong presence amid chain stores like Rite Aid and Starbucks. Clothing stores are lacking, but shoppers have two supermarkets to choose from: Stop & Shop and Big Y.
Some 1,324 acres are preserved as open space. Much of that is contained within three public parks, the largest of them William E. Wolfe Park. ''What I have truly enjoyed at Wolfe Park are the trails,'' Ms. Heslin said. ''They keep it beautifully clean.''
What You'll Pay
At the end of January, just over 70 single-family homes were listed, a very low inventory for Monroe, according to Lawren Hubal, an agent with Re/Max Right Choice. Prices ranged from $57,900, for a modest summer cottage, to $799,999 for a newer six-bedroom five-bath colonial.
''The high $300s are selling the most right now,'' Ms. Hubal said. The bulk of properties are listed in the $420,00-to-$500,000 range, which creates a dearth of options for higher-end buyers as well. ''I have two clients looking in the $600,000 range,'' she said, ''and I can't find them a house.''
There were 15 condominiums on the market at the two complexes in town. Prices ranged from $79,500 to $275,000, for mostly one- and two-bedroom units.
Homes near Wolfe Park are always in demand, Ms. Spanbauer said. Early last year, a colonial on Alpine Road with a four-car garage and a pool sold for $510,000. A three-bedroom in the Great Oak Farm subdivision near the park sold for $420,000 in April.
In Whitney Farms, where lots are generally under an acre, three- and four-bedroom colonials have recently sold in the low- to mid-$400,000s.
Property taxes are a little higher than in some surrounding towns. Using the current mil rate of $29.26, taxes on a property assessed at $400,000 would be about $11,700 in Monroe, $8,960 in Shelton. ''People complain,'' Ms. Spanbauer said. ''But the reasons our taxes are the way they are is because we have a lot of amenities and very little industry.''
What to Do
Wolfe Park has an outdoor pool, playgrounds, courts, fields and hiking trails. Also within its borders, with a beach and a picnic grove, is Great Hollow Lake.
At the town's eastern edge, Webb Mountain affords hikers a view of the Housatonic River. Camping at the adjoining park is permitted for a fee of $10 per site.
A farmers' market is held on the town green on Fridays from June through October.
The Monroe Newcomers and Neighbors Club, a women's organization, has a strong civic component, having recently raised money for the public schools, said Allyson Cussen, the president.
The Schools
With roughly 4,000 students, the Monroe district has three elementary schools, a middle school and a high school.
It is one of 36 districts in Connecticut that offer only half-day kindergarten. That may soon change, as the Board of Education has voted to include a full-day program in next year's budget. Voters will have the final say in May.
SAT averages at Masuk High School in 2012 were 543 in math, 516 in reading and 522 in writing, versus 512, 506 and 510 statewide.
The Commute
Monroe is not on a rail or bus line. Commuters often take Route 25 to the Bridgeport train station, a drive of 15 to 25 minutes, depending on where in Monroe you live. The trip to Grand Central Terminal takes 74 to 94 minutes.
The History
In the summer of 1781, a detachment of French soldiers stopped near the Monroe Center green on their way to meet Washington's Continental Army in Yorktown, Va. According to the Monroe Historical Society, residents welcomed the 600 or so soldiers with a feast. There was a dance on the green and an officers' ball in the Daniel Bassett house.

Hollande Is Hailed in Mali, but Doubts Persist on How Long Peace Will Last

BYLINE: By LYDIA POLGREEN; Steven Erlanger contributed reporting from Munich, Eric Schmitt from Washington, and Scott Sayare from Paris.

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 12

LENGTH: 1329 words

TIMBUKTU, Mali -- France's president, Franחois Hollande, paid a triumphant visit to this ancient city on Saturday, receiving a rapturous welcome from thousands of people who gathered next to a 14th-century mosque to dance, play drums and chant ''Vive la France!'' The muezzin, whose singing calls residents to pray five times a day, wore a scarf in the colors of the French flag as he shouted, ''Vive Hollande!''
It had the trappings of a ''mission accomplished'' moment.
But even as people outside the mud-and-wood mosque hailed the French leader as the city's, and their country's, savior, questions remain about what France has accomplished aside from chasing Islamic extremists from the cities and into their desert and mountain redoubts. 
''These Islamists, they have not been defeated,'' said Moustapha Ben Essayouti, a member of one of the city's most prominent families who lined up to greet Mr. Hollande here. ''Hardly any of them have been killed. They have run into the desert and the mountains to hide.''
Even Mr. Hollande, who praised French and Malian troops gathered here for accomplishing ''an exceptional mission,'' acknowledged that ''the fight is not over.''
Indeed, little is known about the fate of fighters who fled the cities that have been retaken in the lightning northward advance by French and Malian troops to clear Islamists who had taken over the north of the country in recent months. In interviews, residents of cities now abandoned by the Islamist rebels have said that the bulk of the fighters fled in the night long before the French arrived.
Given the fighters' deep familiarity of the vast, forbidding territory between this city and the borders of Algeria and Mauritania, many worry that the Islamist groups will simply regroup and come back to try again.
''If France leaves, they will come back,'' Mr. Essayouti said.
The spidery network of Islamist militants in Mali numbered about 2,000 hard-core fighters before the French airstrikes and march north, according to American intelligence officials, and there are no clear figures yet on how many died in the fighting. The most dangerous component of that mix is Al Qaeda's affiliate in North Africa, known as Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, the officials said.
The group has been attracting heavily armed Islamists from about 10 countries across North and West Africa, making Mali the biggest magnet for jihadi fighters other than Syria, one of the senior American intelligence officials said.
The Islamists who advanced toward a pivotal frontier town on Jan. 10 -- leading to worries of a possible march south to the capital and drawing France into the battle in the process -- were well armed, with AK-47s, rocket-propelled grenades and heavy machine guns mounted on vehicles. They also had some armored personnel carriers seized from the Malian military last year.
American military and counterterrorism officials applauded the speed and efficiency of the French-led operation, but they voiced concerns that the militants had ceded the northern cities with little or no resistance in order to prepare for a longer, bloodier insurgency.
''Longer term, and the French know this, it's going to take a while to root out all these cells and operatives,'' Michael Sheehan, the Pentagon's top special operations policy official, told a defense industry symposium on Wednesday.
The senior United States intelligence official said that the real measure of success would be whether follow-up operations in the north would be able to diminish the strength of Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and other Islamist groups. Like other American officials, he spoke on the condition of anonymity because operations were continuing.
Whether the Islamists are routed in the end may depend in part on how involved France remains. The Malian troops are considered to be poorly trained, and even the most capable of the other African troops pouring into the country as part of a regional force do not have the same level of weaponry to back them up as the French.
Mr. Hollande refused to give a timetable on Saturday for the withdrawal of the 3,500 French troops currently in Mali. In a speech here he said that it is ''not our role to stay,'' but later in the capital of Bamako he said, ''We will be with you to the end, all the way to northern Mali,'' according to the French news media.
In the past, French officials have talked about handing off the fight in the north to the Malian Army and other African troops.
North Africa specialists and American intelligence officials say the militants might lay low until French forces leave.
''Are they going to dig in and be guerrillas or go to ground and wait?'' said Michael R. Shurkin, a former Central Intelligence Agency analyst who is now at the RAND Corporation.
For now, the people of Timbuktu are grateful for France's help. They waved French and Malian flags and sang to the thumping rhythms of djembe drums, which were banned under the harsh version of Shariah imposed by the Islamist group that took control of the city. Men and women danced side by side.
As Mr. Hollande, ringed by security guards, plunged into the crowd to shake hands, some waved banners that said ''Papa Franחois, the mysterious city welcomes you.''
''Hollande is our savior,'' said Arkia Baby, a 24-year-old college student, who wore a purple batik dress of a style banned by the Islamists. ''He gave us back our freedom.''
That sentiment represents a strange twist in France's often troubled history in Africa. France had a vast belt of colonies here that spanned the Sahara, from the Atlantic coast to just short of the Red Sea. After many of its colonies won independence in 1960, many remained bound to France, using a currency pegged to the franc and then the euro, and maintaining close trade, military and diplomatic ties.
France's role has been fraught with moral peril. It pioneered brutal techniques to put down insurgencies in the Algerian war for independence, carpet-bombing villages suspected of harboring nationalist guerrillas. In the early 1990s France staunchly supported the Hutu-dominated government of Rwanda, despite growing signs that a blood bath was in the making.
More recently, French military intervention in Ivory Coast may have heightened ethnic tensions in that country. Even though the French intervened to install the country's democratically elected leader, because the vote was cast along ethnic lines they were seen as favoring northerners and Muslims over southern Christians.
The French lost only one helicopter pilot in Mali, but Mr. Hollande's aides are conscious of the risks of overstaying and becoming targets themselves.
The French hope that with the Islamists in far northern deserts and hills, they can be watched by drones and attacked from the air without harming civilians. The French also expect that the Islamists will have a harder time getting gasoline and food, especially if Algeria, as promised, seals its border with Mali. The French also say the Islamists will find it harder to plan further raids and kidnappings of Westerners that have helped finance their insurgency.
Still, staying and fighting carries risks for France, beyond the safety of its troops. French officials have voiced concerns about charges that the regular Malian Army has been guilty of human rights abuses, including murders of Tuareg and Arab civilians they accuse of ties to the militants.
Mr. Hollande warned the French and African troops here that they must avoid abuses, lest they ''tarnish the mission.''
Writing in the newspaper Libיration, the French columnist Vincent Giret argued that the French face an unhappy choice in Mali. If they remain on the front line they will look, ''sooner or later, like white neocolonialists,'' and any bad episode can turn public opinion quickly sour. But if the French Army ''settles for a role supporting the Malian and African troops left on the front line, it then risks being accused of covering up abuses and score settlings.''

Taliban Militants Attack Pakistani Base

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- Taliban militants killed at least nine soldiers and four paramilitary soldiers in an attack on a Pakistani Army base in northwestern Pakistan early Saturday, officials said. Ten civilians, including three women and three children who were living in a nearby compound, were also killed. 
The brazen assault took place in the restive Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province just a day after a suicide bombing near a mosque in another northwestern town, Hangu, killed at least 26 people.
A spokesman for Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, commonly known as the Pakistani Taliban, claimed responsibility and said the attack was to avenge the death of two Taliban commanders killed in American drone strikes.
According to initial details, Taliban militants, armed with heavy machine guns, fired rockets in the predawn assault at the base in Serai Norang in the Lakki Marwat district, setting off a heavy gun battle that lasted for several hours.
A Pakistani Army official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that 12 militants were killed in the assault.
''Bodies of four terrorists, out of which two were wearing suicide jackets, are in custody of security forces,'' the official said.
Eighteen members of the security forces were wounded in the attack and were sent for treatment to a military hospital in Peshawar, the provincial capital.
During the attack, one of the suicide bombers entered a house near the camp and detonated his explosives, killing the women and children, the official said.
Pakistani officials described the base as ''an isolated camp'' and one of the three bases set up two years ago to wrest Lakki Marwat from the control of Taliban militants.
The ferocity of the attack, which appeared to have been well planned and coordinated, took security officials by surprise, and they speculated that the attackers came from the neighboring lawless semiautonomous tribal regions, where the government has traditionally had little sway.
''We are trying to piece together evidence,'' a security official said.
Lakki Marwat borders the tribal region of South Waziristan, a rugged frontier that is a redoubt of Taliban militants.
Large-scale Taliban assaults, involving several dozen fighters, are not unprecedented and indicate the extent of the challenge posed to the embattled security forces.
In the most recent such attack in December, several dozen Taliban militants kidnapped 22 tribal police officers after attacking security checkpoints on the outskirts of Peshawar. One police officer escaped but the rest were killed.
The Pakistani Army provided few details about the assault on Saturday and the subsequent operation to clear out the area.
But army officials maintained that the assault was successfully repulsed. The exact number of attackers remained unclear.
The Taliban spokesman, Ihsanullah Ihsan, who said in a telephone interview the attack was in retaliation for the killings of two Taliban commanders, identified one of the commanders as Wali Muhammad, also known as Toofani Mehsud. He was killed in an American drone strike on Jan. 6 in the tribal region of South Waziristan and was known as a trainer of suicide bombers.
The country's lawless tribal regions have been a haven for local and foreign militants and as a result have been a frequent target of American drone strikes. Pakistan's Parliament has repeatedly demanded an end to drone strikes, but Pakistani officials privately acknowledge the effectiveness of such attacks.

A LITTLE BOY WITH BANANAS
Brown hair hangs over brown eyes
Looking at brown feet
Standing on the brown earth.
A little boy with yellow bananas
Needs a green dollar to feed his family for a week.
A twinkle in his eye --
Reminds me of a freckly-faced, spoiled kid brother --
Then again, the boy could have been me
In another life. 
My white hand reaches for my black wallet.
The little boy's hope is sparked.
But I come up empty-handed.
His best broken English --
A futile attempt to earn that green dollar.
I could feed his family for a week.
A little boy with bananas, eyes full of a little brother's charm...
Contact -- left. Explosion, to the rear --
Driver-side mirror vibrates, displaying images of dark black smoke.
White hand moves toward black gun -- exposed --
Ducking down -- pinging sound of metal striking metal -- exposed.
Realization: brass hitting the roof from on top of the hatch,
Machine guns fire in all directions.
Convoy moves, brass stops hitting roof.
''Go, let's go!''
Truck engines roar, everything else silenced.
Bodies lie motionless while --
A little brown boy stands over a brown man clutching a black grenade --
Brown eyes connect with brown eyes.
That stare straight up from the brown earth.
A brown hand drops a green dollar;
It lands on a white shirt turned red.
Yellow bananas lie scattered,
I will never look at my kid brother the same.
Brown eyes drop transparent tears and my white hands begin to shake.
I drive full speed away from the city.
How dare I look back?
TRAVIS L. MARTIN, faculty member, Eastern Kentucky University; published in The Journal of Military Experience
PUT THE TRUCK IN GEAR AND DRIVE I scramble -- weapon in hand -- to the top of the hatch. I expect the worst. Small-arms fire explodes from the rear of the convoy and I look to see where the return fire is directed. I don't see any burning or exploded military vehicles, only confusion. The Iraqis lining the streets -- men, women and children -- are all running for their lives. I raise my weapon and start to scan. Amongst the chaos, I look for anyone brandishing a weapon. I scan left, right, up and down. In the parking lot to my left, a man in a light brown gown runs toward the convoy. He is approximately 40 yards out, tall and slender, with a thick black beard and white turban stained from exposure to the desert. He clutches something wrapped in cloth around his midsection. I fix my sights on the man because he is running toward the convoy while concealing something in his clothes -- he looks suspicious. The man shambles forward awkwardly and the hidden object drops. He frantically tries to catch whatever it is, but it slips through his fingers. It is round in shape and dark in color; it doesn't bounce, meaning it is likely made of metal. Finally, I put two and two together: ''Grennnnnnaaaaade!'' I yell. With gunfire all around me, I realize I am the only one who can hear me. Training kicks in. I can't let him get away. I can't let him get close enough to the convoy to use his grenade effectively. I begin firing three-to-six-round bursts. Hit. The man falls but is not dead. I must have hit him in the shoulder because he gets back up, grabs the round object. He is getting close to a generator, which I recognize to be his closest form of cover. He is only five feet away from escaping my sights. I aim again for his bottom right foot, leading my bullets about two feet in front of him for effect. I fire one more time, spraying a wall of lead and ripping across his upper right thigh and back before decimating his left shoulder. He falls and does not move again. ... ... Amidst the screams and cries of the civilians, I hear the panicky cries of my driver, Specialist Morgan, louder than anything else. I kneel down to see if she is in pain. Maybe she did get hit. ''Morgan, are you O.K.?'' I have to scream because of the intense ringing in my ears. ''Why are you shooting at them? Why is this happening? Why? Why?'' Morgan is angry at me and has a stream of tears flowing down her face. Her reaction makes me furious. How could she be so blind to what is happening? ''These are loving people, why are you shooting at them?'' Morgan asks. Her hands cover her face. This is the wrong damn time and I am the wrong damn person to be arguing with about the morality of war. I get angry as I think of her closing her eyes the moment lead started to fly. ''Goddamn it, Morgan! These people fired at us. So [expletive] yeah we're shooting at them.'' How could she worry more about these people -- people who are trying to harm us, I might add -- than those of us trying to keep her alive? I see the convoy starting to move and Morgan's face still buried in her hands. ''Morgan,'' I say in a calmer voice. ''Put the [expletive] truck in gear and drive.'' She doesn't respond and then rage and desperation kick back in. ''Morgan, put the [expletive] truck in gear, goddamn it!''... ...We finally get out of Fallujah and to our destination. After a debriefing and quick ammo count, the commander allows us to bed down. I roll out my sleeping bag on the back of the flat rack on our truck. I take my boots off, place them next to my vest and helmet, then lie on top of the bag. The weather is still too warm to crawl inside. My M-249 and a fresh drum of ammo rest on bipods parallel to my bag. I replay the actions of the day over and over in my head. Just when I think I have justified every little action -- accounted for every little detail -- a switch goes off like the pushing of a rewind button on the VCR. I can't get it out of my head and get a sick feeling in my gut every time I see the image of that man falling to his death. I still get that same sick feeling today. I lie there with my feet crossed and my hands resting over my stomach, staring at the millions of stars flickering above. I'm alone and enjoy the solitude. In the background I hear soldiers telling each other of their actions that day. Some are laughing and cracking jokes and others are just there to listen. The best thing is that we are all here to talk about it. We all made it out of Fallujah. MICAH OWEN, former student, Eastern Kentucky University; published in The Journal of Military Experience (the author used a pseudonym for his driver)
WHEN MEMORIAL DAY BLEEDS ACROSS THE CALENDAR The streets were suddenly desolate, except for a group of kids sitting on the cour tyard wall of a school. In seconds, the radio chatter followed, as it began to mirror the sense of foreboding that swept over the men in the hatches. No cars were on the roads, and shops and cafes were empty. The ghosts of the city watched silently as we passed concealed roadside bombs and abandoned houses rigged to explode. As we approached the school, the kids on the wall plugged their ears and grinned in depraved anticipation. They had been waiting for us all morning. The blast that killed Brian Chevalier tore through armored steel like a bull colliding with a thin red sheet. His Stryker took flight for just a moment, corkscrewed through the air and landed on its side. Broken bodies poured out the back and were loaded onto other trucks as machine guns fired on rooftops lined with insurgents. Chevy was placed gently into a body bag as the school courtyard wall was being eaten by monstrous Bradley guns. The kids either ran away or lay dead in the compound. Chevy was not the only one who slipped into darkness that day. ALEX HORTON, Georgetown junior; posted on VAntagePoint
YELLOW Their skin was yellow. They had dirt under their fingernails and their feet were dirty. There were six of them, all women, under the tarpaulin. Some of them lived long enough to have their wounds bandaged before they died. Some died more or less instantly as shrapnel or 7.62-mm rounds entered their bodies. They had been dead for about 24 hours. We came to witness their funeral, to witness and to stand a type of guard. If we were present, the Serb snipers would not shoot at the family members as they buried their dead. It was the first time I had ever seen war dead. I remember being surprised that their skin was yellow. My experiences with death before that day were limited to a few funerals: a friend's older brother, my grandmother. None of them had been yellow. So I was surprised at the color. It was the first time I ever saw dead people without embalming, without makeup and a nice suit of clothes. They lay in a tangle of limbs under a blue tarp in a trailer that only weeks before probably carried peppers and corn to the market in Malisevo. RON CAPPS, founder, Veterans Writing Project; published in JMWW journal
UNTITLED I lunged toward my dad and the half-empty bottle of vodka in his hand. I stared at him -- his eyes were glazed over -- he stared back at me. After nearly 10 years of sobriety, he was throwing it all away because I was on my way to Iraq. The banners still hung on our kitchen walls from three years earlier, when I had enlisted in the U.S. Army. They read, ''Congratulations Private Hoit!'' and ''Go Army!''

Documentaries Thrive in Sandy's Ruins

BYLINE: By JOHN ANDERSON

SECTION: Section AR; Column 0; Arts and Leisure Desk; Pg. 14

LENGTH: 992 words

For three and a half years Ben Kalina struggled to find just the right elements and imagery that would make his documentary ''Shored Up,'' a convincing statement about rising seas, beach erosion, the fragility of barrier islands and the wisdom of replenishing oceanfront property.
''Then'' he said, ''Sandy hit.'' 
It was a profoundly ill wind that blew onto the East Coast in late October, the so-called superstorm leaving more than 130 dead in New York and New Jersey and causing an estimated $82 billion in damage. It was inevitable that filmmakers would seize on the story. The unearthly atmosphere of a blacked-out Lower Manhattan alone was enough to send would-be auteurs prowling the streets with cameras.
''I even got on the back of a Vespa and shot it from the F. D. R. Drive,'' said Dana O'Keefe, an executive with the film company Cinetic Media. ''I felt it had to be documented. I've lived here all my life, and I felt like an alien.''
But while the footage that Mr. O'Keefe and others collected during Sandy and its aftermath will probably be making its way into movies for years, festival directors from Austin to Toronto, from TriBeCa to San Francisco are already getting completed Sandy films, less than three months after the fact. Advances like digital filmmaking have made speedy responses more common. Less than a year after the Japanese tsunami of 2011 several documentaries and fiction films made their debuts at the Berlin Film Festival and elsewhere. And as with that disaster there were a handful of documentarylike television programs on Hurricane Sandy within weeks.
Mr. Kalina, who produces and directs videos for nonprofits through his Philadelphia company Mangrove Media, already had a feature-length film in the works, so he was ahead of the game, albeit in need of a hook. ''There's only so much you can do to get people to visualize what rising sea levels mean,'' he said. While he said he was loath to admit it, his movie benefited from having taken so long to complete.
But others have moved with alacrity. ''There's a window of opportunity to collect donations,'' said David Darg, who, with his filmmaking partner, Bryn Mooser, produced ''The Rider and the Storm,'' which focuses on the catastrophic fire in Breezy Point, Queens, and an ironworker who surfs in local waters.
The purpose of their films, Mr. Darg said, is to raise both awareness and money. Tellingly, perhaps, their previous two films were both set in Haiti after the earthquake (''Sun City Picture House'' and ''Baseball in the Time of Cholera''), and moving quickly is something they've learned to do in their work providing footage from disaster zones not only for news outlets like the BBC and CNN but also nonprofits in those areas.
''You have to show people what's on the ground and how money makes an impact,'' Mr. Darg said. ''We get asked how we can turn around films so quickly. But experience has forced us to hone our skills, shooting quickly, editing quickly and getting the material back to broadcast or Internet or to donors.''
Mr. Mooser said they had already submitted ''The Rider and the Storm,'' a 16-minute short, to the Tribeca Film Festival, which has accepted their previous films. ''Tribeca was born out of disaster, and our films are born out of disaster,'' he said, referring to Sept. 11. ''So it's a good home.''
Sharon Badal, Tribeca's director of short-film programming and initiatives, said the work of Mr. Mooser and Mr. Darg is part of a changing movie landscape. ''Documentary filmmakers can now create work that immediately responds to global events,'' she said. ''A short film in particular, with its minimal turnaround time, is well-suited to this new journalism.'' Also, she said, such films can counteract the often redundant and generic-seeming approach of traditional news media.
While Mr. Kalina's film takes a macro approach, Marcie Allen went micro: ''Beach 119'' is about the damage caused to one block in the Rockaways in Queens. It also shows how a natural disaster can make strange filmmaking bedfellows.
A music promoter, Ms. Allen was supposed to fly from Nashville to New York on the Tuesday after the storm hit. ''Obviously that didn't happen,'' she said. Before she could return she saw on Facebook that a mutual friend had reposted a message from Issy Sanchez, a 35-year music industry veteran: ''Can't type long, losing power, no food, no water, please send help.'' When Ms. Allen landed on Saturday, she said, she loaded her Jeep with gas, water and pizza and drove to Mr. Sanchez's block, Beach 119th Street in Queens. There she found a disaster that turned into a mission that turned into a movie.
After the trip to the Rockaways, she said, ''my co-worker Jessica Beutler and I sent an industry e-mail that said exactly what I'd seen on Beach 119th Street, and we raised $6,000 to $7,000 overnight.'' Donations, which ultimately totaled $100,000, came in the form of gift cards to Home Depot for heaters, generators and more.
Then her friend Nate Parienti, president of the multimedia production company Live Alliance, suggested making a documentary. Ms. Allen recalled, ''We shot it in one day and reached out to the Tribeca and South by Southwest festivals, and they extended their deadlines.''
''Of course,'' she added, ''we don't know if we'll be accepted yet.''
Neither do Mr. Darg, Mr. Mooser or Mr. Kalina, who said there should be limits to the devotion a filmmaker has to his craft.
''My film was always largely about Long Beach Island,'' in New Jersey, he said, ''because it exemplified the speed of change that can happen and the dynamism of the coast. And that's why we were looking at surfing, the reshaping of the seafloor, nor'easters, any number of ways to make our point, some of them very subtle.''
Subtlety evaporated once Sandy hit.
''I actually got onto Long Beach Island before they closed it,'' Mr. Kalina said.
And then what did he do?
''I made the rational decision,'' he said, ''and left.''

Dangerous Gun Myths

SECTION: Section SR; Column 0; Editorial Desk; EDITORIAL | THE GUN CHALLENGE; Pg. 10

LENGTH: 795 words

The debate over what to do to reduce gun violence in America hit an absurd low point on Wednesday when a Senate witness tried to portray a proposed new ban on assault rifles and high-capacity magazines as some sort of sexist plot that would disproportionately hurt vulnerable women and their children.
The witness was Gayle Trotter, a fellow at the Independent Women's Forum, a right-wing public policy group that provides pseudofeminist support for extreme positions that are in fact dangerous to women. She told the Senate Judiciary Committee that the limits on firepower proposed by Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, would harm women because an assault weapon ''in the hands of a young woman defending her babies in her home becomes a defense weapon.'' She spoke of the ''peace of mind'' and ''courage'' a woman derives from ''knowing she has a scary-looking gun'' when she's fighting violent criminals. 
It is not at all clear where Ms. Trotter gained her insight into confrontations between women and heavily armed intruders, since it is not at all clear that sort of thing happens often. It is tempting to dismiss her notion that an AR-15 is a woman's best friend as the kooky reflex response of someone ideologically opposed to gun control laws and who, in her case, has also been a vociferous opponent of the Violence Against Women Act, the 1994 law that assists women facing domestic violence.
But it is important to note that Ms. Trotter was chosen to testify by the committee's Republican members, who will have a big say on what, if anything, Congress does on guns; and that her appearance before the committee was to give voice to the premise, however insupportable and dangerous it may be, that guns make women and children safer -- and the more powerful the guns the better.
Ms. Trotter related the story of Sarah McKinley, an 18-year-old Oklahoma woman who shot and killed an intruder on New Year's Eve 2011, when she was home alone with her baby. The story was telling, but not in the way she intended, as Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, pointed out. The woman was able to repel the intruder using an ordinary Remington 870 Express 12-gauge shotgun, which would not be banned under the proposed statute. She did not need a military-style weapon with a 30-round magazine.
But there is a more fundamental problem with the idea that guns actually protect the hearth and home. Guns rarely get used that way. In the 1990s, a team headed by Arthur Kellermann of Emory University looked at all injuries involving guns kept in the home in Memphis, Seattle and Galveston, Tex. They found that these weapons were fired far more often in accidents, criminal assaults, homicides or suicide attempts than in self-defense. For every instance in which a gun in the home was shot in self-defense, there were seven criminal assaults or homicides, four accidental shootings, and 11 attempted or successful suicides.
The cost-benefit balance of having a gun in the home is especially negative for women, according to a 2011 review by David Hemenway, director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center. Far from making women safer, a gun in the home is ''a particularly strong risk factor'' for female homicides and the intimidation of women.
In domestic violence situations, the risk of homicide for women increased eightfold when the abuser had access to firearms, according to a study published in The American Journal of Public Health in 2003. Further, there was ''no clear evidence'' that victims' access to a gun reduced their risk of being killed. Another 2003 study, by Douglas Wiebe of the University of Pennsylvania, found that females living with a gun in the home were 2.7 times more likely to be murdered than females with no gun at home.
Regulating guns, on the other hand, can reduce that risk. An analysis by Mayors Against Illegal Guns found that in states that required a background check for every handgun sale, women were killed by intimate partners at a much lower rate. Senator Patrick Leahy, the Judiciary Committee chairman, has used this fact to press the case for universal background checks, to make sure that domestic abusers legally prohibited from having guns cannot get them.
As for the children whose safety Ms. Trotter professes to be so concerned about, guns in the home greatly increase the risk of youth suicides. That is why the American Academy of Pediatrics has long urged parents to remove guns from their homes.
The idea that guns are essential to home defense and women's safety is a myth. It should not be allowed to block the new gun controls that the country so obviously needs.
This is part of a continuing series on the epidemic of gun violence and possible solutions. Other editorials are at nytimes.com/gunchallenge.

Brothers, Romans, Filmmakers

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

SECTION: Section AR; Column 0; Arts and Leisure Desk; Pg. 14

LENGTH: 1334 words

Nearly 40 years ago the brothers Paolo and Vittorio Taviani wrote and directed ''Allonsanfan,'' starring Marcello Mastroianni as a revolutionary in the Napoleonic era. After its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival Mr. Mastroianni met with reporters, and when they asked him about the unusual experience of working with two directors on the same film, he feigned surprise. ''Were they two?'' he asked.
The Tavianis are now in their 80s, but at an age when most of their contemporaries have retired they continue making films, and in seamless unity. Their latest effort, ''Caesar Must Die,'' which opens on Wednesday, is one of their most artistically ambitious productions: a fictional feature with elements of a documentary and the theater, about the staging of Shakespeare's ''Julius Caesar'' in a maximum-security prison in Rome. 
''What kind of film is this?'' Vittorio Taviani, 83, asked rhetorically during an interview last fall, when ''Caesar Must Die'' was shown at the New York Film Festival. ''It's a true film, a fiction film in which the reality of the prison is physically palpable.'' Paolo Taviani, 81, completed the thought: ''The energy of this film is born of pain, you see the walls and the bars before you, the authentic pain of the people living inside the prison.''
The Tavianis, who have written or directed 22 films together, are not the only pair of siblings making films together of course. In Europe there are also the Dardenne brothers of Belgium, while the United States has the Coens, the Wachowskis, the Farrellys and the Hugheses. But the Tavianis have been doing it longer than anyone else -- since 1954 -- and have developed a working method that minimizes friction by alternating the direction of individual scenes.
''The crew that knows us asks, 'Who's the first today?' '' Paolo explained. ''And while that person is at the helm the crew has to answer only to the director in charge at that moment. They can't go ask Paolo something they want to do. When it's finished, I come and look at the video.''
Vittorio continued: ''The other is at the monitor, watching the video. We have a very acute nonverbal, telepathic communication. If the one at the monitor starts to scratch his head, the other understands. So we have a silent meeting, we correct it, and then we go off again.''
Writing scripts works in much the same fashion. They live within walking distance of each other in Rome, so they will often meet at a park and discuss whatever their current project happens to be while walking their dogs together and then go to one or the other's house and get down to work, seated across from each other at a table.
For ''Caesar Must Die'' the brothers brought in a collaborator, Fabio Cavalli, to help distill and shape the Shakespearean text into a screenplay. In a bit of meta playfulness Mr. Cavalli, who directs a theater troupe at Rebibbia prison in Rome, was cast as the director of the play within the movie.
''The themes of guilt and friendship, betrayal and conspiracy are at the center of Shakespeare's play, and also at the center of the life experience of the actors,'' many of whom are serving terms for Mafia- or Camorra-related crimes, Mr. Cavalli said. ''So many actors and directors had come to Rebibbia,'' he continued, but until the Tavianis came along, ''nobody understood that here was an opportunity to make a movie about this extraordinary environment so full of art, the hope of freedom, and consciousness.''
''Caesar Must Die'' was born when a journalist friend of the Tavianis urged them to visit a performance by the Rebibbia troupe. They were reluctant at first. ''We thought, oh, it's going to be the same old thing,'' Paolo said. But once they saw the prisoners performing Dante and Pirandello, they changed their minds.
''We immediately had this sense that this was a great idea come down to us from the heavens,'' Vittorio said. ''These compatriots of ours are tragic figures, really. They know crime and conspiracy, so let's let them tell the tragedy of Julius Caesar and Mark Antony, which is an Italian story, a Roman story that's part of the collective imagination of the Italian people.''
The Tavianis have a long history of adapting works from the Western literary canon. Since releasing the semi-autobiographical ''The Night of the Shooting Stars,'' an international hit 30 years ago, they have twice made films drawing from Pirandello (''Kaos'' and ''You Laugh'') and Tolstoy (''Night Sun'' and ''Resurrection'') and also adapted Goethe's ''Elective Affinities'' for the screen. In addition they made a mini-series for Italian television, ''Luisa Sanfelice,'' based on a novel by Alexandre Dumas.
''They are very literary sort of intellectuals, but not university-type intellectuals,'' said Peter Bondanella, an emeritus professor at Indiana University and author of ''Italian Cinema: From Neorealism to the Present.'' ''They have this background that was typical of their time, but isn't so common these days. They come not from film school but from a more intellectual direction, and I think that is because of their politics, that they saw film as a way of changing people's minds.''
In several other respects, though, ''Caesar Must Die'' represents a conscious circling back by the Tavianis to their origins. ''At a certain moment we said to ourselves, 'Wouldn't it make more sense to shoot with the same daring with which we shot our very first films?' '' Paolo recalled. ''This is also because we shot the film in 21 days, with very little money, just like when we were very young. So from the economic point of view we were returning to our earliest state.''
''It was exciting,'' he continued. ''There was no time or need to reflect on anything, this or that, to the producer. We were free. This really helped the film. No stars, and we shot digitally. It's the first time we shot in digital, so that was a novelty for us.''
Early in ''Caesar Must Die'' there is a scene in which prisoners are auditioning for the play, and as they perform the camera moves in tight on their faces, which are full of expression and character. That fondness for magnifying the features of ordinary faces has long been a trademark of the Tavianis, who were inspired by Italian Neo-Realist films like Roberto Rossellini's ''Paisan.''
Carmelo Cantone, Rebibbia's warden, said he had favored allowing the Tavianis to shoot there because he hoped their film would show how ''living in this kind of space affects the prisoners.'' Mr. Cantone, who is a bit of a cinephile, watched some of the scenes being filmed but said he was nevertheless startled when he saw the images on a screen.
''When Wim Wenders made his film about the last days of Nicholas Ray, he said that 'through the camera lens I see things I could never see with my naked eye,' '' Mr. Cantone recalled during a telephone interview from Italy. ''Well, it was through the lens of the Tavianis that I came to understand the prisoners and what is going on around me. This is cinema of great pictorial value, a cinema of portraiture done in painterly style.''
Of the many Taviani films the one that shares the closest kinship to ''Caesar Must Die,'' they said, is ''Padre Padrone,'' a compelling tale of an illiterate Sardinian shepherd boy who transforms himself into a professor of linguistics, which won the Palme d'Or at Cannes in 1977. Both films mix professional and nonprofessional actors, use documentary techniques and share a similar sensibility, the brothers explained.
Encouraged by the critical and commercial success of ''Caesar Must Die,'' which won the top prize at the Berlin Film Festival last year, the Tavianis plan to begin work on another film as soon as possible. ''When our sense of amazement is exhausted, when we don't feel those strong emotions anymore, then and only then will we stop,'' Paolo said.
His brother concurred, adding: ''We're sure that another one will come along, just as we're sure about death. I'm saying that in a beautiful realistic sense, considering our age.''

THE GIRL WHO FELL TO EARTHA Memoir
By Sophia Al-Maria271 pp. Harper Perennial. Paper, $14.99.
The neon skyline of the Gulf Arab states encroaching on the Arabian Desert forms the preternatural backdrop to Sophia Al-Maria's memoir, ''The Girl Who Fell to Earth.'' Born to an American mother from Puyallup, near Seattle, and to a Bedouin Qatari father, Al-Maria spent her childhood shuttling between the ''soggy blades of grass'' of the Pacific Northwest and ''the pockmarked moonscape of construction pits and cranes'' in the Qatari capital of Doha.
This is a tale of strangers in strange lands: of Sophia's father, Matar, once a Bedouin boy glued to the communal television in the courtyard of the Al-Dafira tribe's one-room mosque, ''fantasizing about space travel,'' who, years later, flies west, bypassing Mecca and landing in Seattle, ''Home of the Space Needle''; of Sophia's mother, Gale, who converts to Islam in order to marry Matar, ''grudgingly'' agreeing ''to try to pray if Matar agreed to learn to swim''; and of Sophia herself, who navigates the chasms between cultures and places, tribal allegiances and interior spaces. 
Conflict takes many shapes in this memoir, but the most striking is the tension between modernity and tradition in the Gulf states. It is not surprising then that Al-Maria has now made her home in Doha, where she is researching ''Gulf futurism'' at the Arab Museum of Modern Art.
Citing the early-20th-century Futurist movement that glorified technology, speed, industrial cities, youth and violence, surveyors of Gulf futurism see urban planning in the Gulf as part of a movement too, espousing utopian ideals of modernity and prosperity. ''Every week,'' she writes, there was ''more dust cresting off the construction sites, and higher floors added to the grove of young skyscrapers shooting up around us.'' She begins fearing heights and has dreams ''first of plummeting to the ground, then of plunging up into the sky.''
The Gulf's futuristic architecture is accompanied by equally surreal interiors. Of the Doha Sheraton, completed in 1982 and designed by William Pereira, Al-Maria writes: ''The lobby was a seductive Islamic fantasy-future of hexagonal mirrors and disco-lit elevators.'' At its center ''was the largest standing chandelier in the world: a crystal palm tree.'' Later, awaiting the outcome of a quarrel between her parents -- which leads to their eventual separation -- Sophia walks through the hotel, listening to ''the hum of invisible machines running the mother ship of the building,'' spies on her parents arguing in a cafe with a ''player-less piano,'' gets lost among ''brassy mirrors'' and ends up in an empty restaurant with a panoramic view of a ''pink and copper'' sandstorm.
Through the cracks of this science-fiction landscape, Al-Maria observes a wasteland. Efforts to green the terrain fail: ''Grass parched out after a single afternoon,'' and ''trees died still girdled in their shipping mesh.'' Houses, not yet a decade old, crumble. ''The wrinkles of the Gulf were premature,'' she writes, ''and showed in everything I looked at.''
The Gulf is a region still mysterious to the West, whose extent of exposure rarely surpasses glimpses of sheiks attending a summit, or abaya-clad ladies getting into a Rolls-Royce with Hermטs shopping bags. Al-Maria is searching for a deeper understanding in her paternal land, where others are digging only for oil. In addition to writing, she is a filmmaker: she won an award at the Doha Tribeca Film Festival in 2009 for her one-minute short, ''The Racer.'' She has also created ''The Gulf Colloquy Compendium'' -- an evolving online dictionary inspired by Douglas Coupland's ''Dictionary of the Near Future.''
Although her vigor is to be admired, the memoir could have benefited from some restraint: metaphors of extraterrestrial landscapes, while evocative, are too numerous and distracting. Also valuable would have been a more profound discussion of both Bedouin history and identity politics in the Gulf. But then again, as Al-Maria herself writes, she didn't care ''anymore about what Edward Said said,'' with his argument that Western perceptions of Middle Eastern cultures are based on false assumptions. Hers is a more visceral exploration. She offers us an original outlook on ancient ground -- what any artist hopes to achieve.

Warrior Voices

BYLINE: By CECILIA CAPUZZI SIMON. 
Cecilia Capuzzi Simon teaches writing at American University.

RON CAPPS sat alone in a truck in a Darfur desert preparing to shoot himself in the head. He had been in the military for 22 years, serving in the Army and working for the Foreign Service in the world's hot spots, including Afghanistan, Iraq, Kosovo, Sudan and Rwanda. He'd debriefed Iranian terrorists held in Iraq, observed rebel forces and assessed the carnage they'd left behind in Sudan, counted the mass graves of the hundred thousand killed in the civil war in Zaire -- and reported all back to Washington. After five wars in 10 years, Mr. Capps had developed post-traumatic stress disorder, and it was killing him.
But that day in Darfur, his cellphone rang, startling him, and pulling him ''back from the brink.''
''Hello?'' I answered. The static on the phone cleared up. 
''Hey,'' my wife said. ''What's up?'' Uncanny timing.
I paused. I certainly couldn't answer with the truth.
''Not much,'' I said. ''What's up with you?''
Mr. Capps wrote those lines in 2009 in an essay he entitled ''Back From the Brink: War, Suicide and PTSD.'' He was 51, retired and an M.F.A. student at Johns Hopkins, where he used writing to make sense of his war experiences and to manage his trauma. After a particularly inspiring class, he decided to ''give away'' what he was learning in his graduate courses by helping other veterans transition back to civilian life. Today, the nonprofit he created, the Veterans Writing Project, provides free workshops, some in conjunction with George Washington University and some with the National Endowment for the Arts, and publishes a journal of veterans' writing called O-Dark-Thirty.
The Veterans Writing Project is one of several organizations -- including Warrior Writers, based in Philadelphia; New York University's Veterans Writing Workshop; and the Syracuse Veterans' Writing Group -- that have cropped up over the last few years with similar missions. This tradition of healing through words goes back to World War II, when a women's service group brought workshops to veterans in V.A. hospitals, first in Chicago and then spreading to other facilities around the country. The group still operates today out of Mission, Kan., and publishes the journal Veterans' Voices.
The writing workshops are open to veterans of any war, but the service members returning from Iraq and Afghanistan are the ones who are ''changing the conversation,'' says Travis L. Martin, 28, an Iraq veteran and editor of The Journal of Military Experience, a collection of short stories, poems and artwork created by student veterans, which he started at Eastern Kentucky University in 2011.
''The traditional therapies and approaches to PTSD are not getting the job done,'' he says. ''Vets are looking for alternative ways to heal, and they are latching onto writing as a way to do it.''
Thanks in part to generous G.I. Bill benefits, Mr. Martin's first sustained experience back in civilian society happened at a college campus, but he had PTSD, and he had trouble. He created his own regimen of bibliotherapy to deal with avoidance issues and stress. At Eastern Kentucky, administrators turned to him for suggestions for curing poor veteran retention rates: ''What worked for me, I told them, was writing.'' Mr. Martin completed bachelor's and master's degrees in English at Eastern Kentucky and is now at work on his Ph.D. at the University of Kentucky. The second volume of The Journal of Military Experience, published in 2012, reached beyond the university to include veterans from all over the United States.
For a generation weaned in a multimedia confessional society, and at ease with blogging and Facebook, it makes sense that sharing war experiences and fears would be an effective, or at least familiar, way to examine and overcome what Mr. Capps describes as the ''powerful sense of isolation'' that greets most veterans once home. They leave behind a culture built on teamwork for one that doesn't seem to value community, doesn't appear to be at war and doesn't understand them.
Psychologists know that writing is therapeutic. Expressive writing is used in clinical settings to help patients examine anxieties and abuse that are otherwise unspeakable. Exposure therapy -- retelling a traumatic event over and over until it loses its hold over a patient -- often uses writing to extinguish the emotional and physical reaction to trauma.
''My experience,'' Mr. Martin says, ''is that traumatic memories are fragmented. They appear in flashes of intensity, but not always in order.'' The brain must process trauma. But service members don't get that chance before they are shipped off again, only to experience more distress.
The result, Mr. Martin says, is anger, depression, anxiety and fear. ''If you can put those emotions and the traumatic event in a narrative that makes sense to you,'' he says, ''it makes the trauma tangible. If it is tangible, it is malleable. And if it is malleable, you can do something with it.''
The military is looking to writing and other art forms, like painting and music, to help rewire the brain after trauma. At Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Md., Ron Capps leads weekly workshops for service members recovering from PTSD and traumatic brain injury. He starts them off with two fundamental questions: What is different about the military experience, and why do we bother writing things down?
''We write,'' he explains, ''to bear witness.''
Paraphrasing Oliver Wendell Holmes, who served in the infantry in the Civil War, he adds, ''We have a responsibility to bring back a report to those who've sent us out.''
Kate Hoit, 28, had been writing a memoir -- stories about war, lost friends, alcoholic parents -- when she joined Mr. Capps's first workshop, at George Washington University in 2011. The workshops, which run 6 to 14 weeks, are meant to be both a healing experience and an opportunity to create art. Mr. Capps asks participants to step away from their war experiences and observe the details in new ways. They talk about character development, narrative structure and point of view.
Ms. Hoit received critiques from other veterans; she trusted their reactions. She had recently graduated from the University at Albany, where she studied journalism. She was no stranger to sharing her writing, but had found civilian classrooms awkward and frustrating. She had felt judged for her subject matter.
Even now, as a student in Johns Hopkins's M.F.A. program, she finds herself battling stereotypes. After one reading, a classmate asked her, ''Why would anyone join the military if they didn't want to kill someone?'' She is angry about the ''media-shaped'' portrayal of the wars and feels a responsibility to ''reshape that picture and ground it into truth.''
''It's like people think the only people who join the military are poor or lesbians,'' she says.
Or stupid, chimes in Alex Horton on a joint phone call from the Department of Veterans Affairs, where he and Ms. Hoit work. Mr. Horton, a 27-year-old junior at Georgetown University, recalls a class in which students -- ''kids with perfect scores'' and little life experience -- voiced the belief that an all-volunteer army was a security risk because it attracts a disadvantaged socioeconomic class. ''I stood up and said, 'Wait a minute! There are hundreds of veterans here on campus as smart or smarter than you,' '' he said. ''These are the people who will be at State and the Department of Defense, and this is what they think the military is like.''
In veterans' circles, Mr. Horton is known for Army of Dude, the blog he began while in Iraq in 2006-7. It is imperative, he says, that the stories of the current wars be written and disseminated, especially on college campuses, where future decision makers are clustered. ''Ron's model is important,'' he says. Mr. Horton took part in a workshop at George Washington University conducted by Mr. Capps, who is also developing an undergraduate course on war writing for the university, tentatively for the fall.
At Eastern Kentucky, Mr. Martin teaches a veterans-only course that mixes expressive writing with practical advice on navigating college. The writing component is not mandatory. Neither does he ask that students read stories out loud. He's not sure the class can handle the emotions they stir. He's not sure he can. ''I'm still going through my own stuff,'' he says. He works with students one on one, going through as many as six drafts.
Most of the stories, he says, are about ''trauma, trauma, trauma, trauma'': a marine whose friend is killed by a sniper; a convoy ambushed in Iraq; the smell of burning bodies in a firebombed bus; a mass grave site in Bosnia and a girl from it who makes recurring appearances in a veteran's dreams.
''These guys are putting out some pretty hard-core stuff,'' he says.
Micah Owen, who had served with Mr. Martin in the same unit in Iraq, was a student in his class. He finished two years at Eastern Kentucky before moving to Oregon, where he has family and works on the production line at GloryBee Foods.
Mr. Owen, who is 30 and has PTSD, says he has trouble talking about his war experience, but he discovered he has no trouble writing about it.
''I was struggling to stay on top of things,'' he says. ''Travis knew I had to talk about things, but that it was easier to put it down on paper. Once the words started coming, I couldn't stop them.''
Mr. Owen's story for the class -- his first attempt at writing, beyond song lyrics -- is a dramatic account of his convoy being ambushed in Fallujah. It was published in the first volume of Mr. Martin's Journal of Military Experience, and it was the first time Mr. Owen's family had heard about his military service. ''I hardly ever spoke about it with them,'' he says. ''This was a way for my family to know what I had done.''
After reading the story, his mother cried. Mr. Owen urged his father, a Vietnam veteran, to write down the experiences he had never spoken of. At first his father balked. But in the second volume of the journal, there are two Owen essays, one by father and one by son.

Sunday Dialogue: Treating the Mentally Ill

Discussing a psychiatrist's objections to mandated treatment.
To the Editor:
Recent tragic events have linked mental illness and violence. Some people -- I, for one -- consider this link dangerously stigmatizing. People with mental illness are far more likely to be victims of violence than perpetrators. Moreover, psychiatrists have limited capacity to reliably predict violence. Nonetheless, these events increase pressure to identify people who might conceivably commit violent acts, and to mandate treatment with antipsychotic medications.
For a tiny minority of patients who have committed serious crimes, mandated treatment can be effective, particularly as an alternative to incarceration. But for most patients experiencing psychotic states, mandated treatment may create more problems than it solves.
For many medical conditions, better outcomes occur when patients share in treatment design and disease management. Imposed treatments tend to engender resistance and resentment. This is also true for psychiatric conditions. 
Patients with psychotic symptoms often feel that their own experience is dismissed as meaningless, like the ravings of an intoxicated or delirious person. Decisions to decline antipsychotic medications are often regarded mainly as a manifestation of illness -- an illness the person is too sick to recognize -- even though many people might reject antipsychotics because of metabolic and other toxicities.
When a clearly troubled person firmly believes that he or she needs no help, there are no simple answers. These situations are particularly agonizing for families. Safety is paramount -- and at times can be elusive. Still, if psychiatrists humbly try to understand the person on his or her own terms, do not dismiss the person's experience as meaningless and truly respect the person's choices about treatment, sometimes this opens the way to an effective treatment relationship. For some suffering and alienated people -- certainly not all -- feeling respectfully understood can be a critical step toward recovery.
Mandated treatment is a blunt instrument that may drive more people away from seeking care than it compels into care.
CHRISTOPHER GORDON Framingham, Mass., Jan. 28, 2013
The writer is a psychiatrist and an associate clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.
Readers React
After decades of relentless psychosis, forced treatment was the only way that my mother was able to begin her path to recovery. As a psychiatrist and a family member of a loved one with schizophrenia, I know well the challenges of caring for individuals who firmly and consistently refuse help.
For me, the dilemma of forced treatment is an issue of access to care, and should be based on whether an individual is able to fully understand the nature, risks, benefits and alternatives of treatment, or of refusing that treatment. Because of a phenomenon known as anosognosia, certain psychotic and manic individuals do not recognize their symptoms. Without compelling treatment for this population, they rarely voluntarily seek the care that they desperately need and deserve, often leading to heartbreaking outcomes such as homelessness and incarceration.
For my mother, and for hundreds of thousands of others with severe mental illness, declining treatment is not about providers not listening, side effects of medications or stubborn denial. She fundamentally does not believe she needs help, despite a wealth of reality-based evidence to the contrary.
While mandated treatment involves complex considerations and should be an approach of last resort, for individuals with a clear history of serious mental illness who are unable to make reasonable medical decisions, it is at times the difference between empowering the person with the illness, rather than empowering the illness itself.
GARY TSAI San Francisco, Jan. 31, 2013
The problem with our mental health system is it prioritizes improving mental health over treating serious mental illness. Less than 9 percent of Americans have serious mental illnesses like schizophrenia. Another 25 to 40 percent have poor mental health. The ''psychotic killer'' headlines are the result of cutting services for the seriously ill to pay for services for all others.
We used to have enough psychiatric hospitals for the most seriously ill. Today, we spend more on mental health but are short 95,000 psychiatric beds. Three times as many mentally ill will spend tonight incarcerated rather than hospitalized largely as a result of our new spending priorities.
Are people with mental illness more violent than others? The 25 to 40 percent are not. Those in the 5 to 9 percent who go untreated are.
Court-ordered assisted outpatient treatment helps these most seriously ill individuals get treatment and reduces violence, dangerous behavior, suicide and incarceration. Such treatment programs go largely unfunded while programs for newly minted mental health issues like bullying are showered with dollars. To reduce episodes of violence, we have to target the population most likely to be involved in it. We have to send the most seriously ill to the front of the line for services.
D. J. JAFFE Executive Director Mental Illness Policy Org. New York, Jan. 30, 2013
I am the parent of a 15-year-old boy who suffers from severe mental illness. My son has been violent. He has tried to strangle me, he held a baby sitter at knifepoint when he was 5, and he continues to be a danger to himself and others. My son is not a monster, and he is not evil. He is loving, kind, smart and polite. And he is severely mentally ill.
With all due respect to Dr. Gordon, I could not disagree with his views more. As a parent who lives in a state of crisis every day, I am sure that in this case, the patient's rights would be better preserved by offering him a safe and therapeutic environment. A severely mentally ill individual is incapable of knowing what is in his or her best interest. For the small percentage of people who are severely mentally ill, involuntary treatment is the only solution. The alternative is the streets or prison.
If my son had cancer or any other illness or disability, he would receive the necessary treatment for his success and well-being. Unfortunately, because his disability is severe mental illness, and because of doctors and lawmakers who think like Dr. Gordon, my son will likely die on the streets or in jail.
That is an outrage.
LEISL STOUFER Torrance, Calif., Jan. 30, 2013
I was hospitalized against my will and forcibly given electroshock and damaging medication. After three brutalizing years in the broken mental health system, the best help for me finally came from a kind and gentle doctor who listened to me, believed in my many strengths and encouraged me back into college and a full life.
Dr. Gordon is correct. Kindness is the best medicine of all.
DOROTHY W. DUNDAS Newton, Mass., Jan. 30, 2013
Dr. Gordon's preference for mandating psychiatric treatment only for those mentally ill individuals who have committed serious crimes is admirable -- unless you are one of the victims of that serious crime.
As a state prosecutor in Maine for more than 20 years, I have had a front-row seat as the mental health community has abdicated responsibility for untreated, and obviously unbalanced, individuals until they have committed a crime. As a result, thousands of mentally ill defendants are crowded into county jails awaiting trial. But there are worse fates for these individuals.
Sometimes they become engaged in lethal police encounters, when law enforcement officers are forced to use deadly force to protect themselves or others. In Maine, more than 40 percent of individuals shot by police officers in the last 12 years had mental health problems.
Sometimes they kill family members. The 2010 Report of the Maine Domestic Abuse Homicide Review Panel found, ''More than ever before the panel has reviewed cases involving intrafamilial homicide; a significant number of these cases involved perpetrators who have mental illness and are not medication compliant.''
As one newspaper commentator recently observed about Maine's mentally ill, ''We are killing them, and they are killing us.''
My colleagues and I regularly encounter family members of mentally ill defendants who plead with us to somehow get treatment for their loved one before they do something unthinkable.
I sometimes wonder if Adam Lanza's mother faced this same predicament.
JAMES ANDREWS Farmington, Me., Jan. 30, 2013
I am a mental health counselor and an advocate in the child welfare system, and I see the effects of enforced treatment on a daily basis. In my observation, receiving mental health treatment does not necessarily reduce violence, and can sometimes even make people more violent than they would otherwise be. While some people do just fine on medication, psychiatric drugs can sometimes induce or exacerbate violent behavior. Prozac was initially banned for sale in Germany in the late 1980s for this very reason.
Many of those responsible for mass shootings in the last 20 years actually were receiving or had received psychiatric drug treatment before they went on their sprees. Given the known side effects, it is likely that these drugs caused or contributed to a large number of these incidents. At the least, we can say that giving these people psychiatric treatment, even voluntarily, did nothing to prevent them from going on a shooting rampage.
Rather than blaming the victims, mental health professionals need to keep a close eye on those who are prescribed psychiatric drugs, and make sure that they are taken off such drugs if they show any signs of instability, violence or self-harm. Counting on enforced psychiatric treatment to reduce or prevent violent shooting sprees is at best ineffective and may, in fact, be making things worse.
STEPHEN T. McCREA Portland, Ore., Jan. 30, 2013
Thank you, Dr. Gordon, for arguing against mandated treatment. As a mental health counselor, I am often appalled at how we have seemingly lost our way in our treatment of people experiencing psychotic symptoms. Rather than looking for alternative, more humane solutions, we have convinced this population that there are few options apart from psychotropic sedation.
We would be better off looking to other countries that are finding success with models such as ''open dialogue,'' a family and social network approach originating in Finland and now starting to be used in the United States.
MELANIE DOWNS New York, Jan. 30, 2013
The Writer Responds
I do not deny that people suffering from mental illness commit acts of violence. I know that caring for a loved one who ragefully rejects help can be agonizing and that families often bear the burden of this violence. My heart goes out to Ms. Stoufer and her son.
Dr. Tsai powerfully captures the conundrum of an extreme case, in which his mother's judgment was so impaired that compulsory care was necessary. However, anosognosia is a slippery slope.
It's just too easy -- unless we doctors are scrupulously humble -- to mistake disagreement for disease, and inadvertently dismiss the legitimate preferences of people with mental illness. What applies to extreme situations must be very carefully generalized.
Mr. Jaffe highlights mandated outpatient treatment. For some, this intervention is helpful. But the research is unsettled. It's unclear whether it's the mandate or the availability of more treatment that helps people. It is clear that the more people experience their care as fair and noncoercive, the more helpful it is.
I believe we need more services that are inviting, build on strengths, offer peer and family partner supports, and include real choice about medications. In my view, we rely too much on medications -- and inducing or forcing people to take them -- rather than appreciating the complexity of the problems people face and providing services that people want.
Our fragmented, underfunded system has been disastrous for many. Jails crowded with people with mental illness testify to that.
Respecting the rights of our fellow citizens with mental illness requires reserving mandated treatment to conditions of adjudicated incompetence or imminent dangerousness, or as an alternative to incarceration.
Coercion is sometimes necessary, but we should be clear about its cost: trust and collaboration are largely incompatible with force. Genuine partnership can be a balm for many hurts, and open the way for some people to real and lasting growth.

The Spy Novelist Who Knows Too Much

BYLINE: By ROBERT F. WORTH

SECTION: Section MM; Column 0; Magazine Desk; Pg. 18

LENGTH: 3891 words

Last June, a pulp-fiction thriller was published in Paris under the title ''Le Chemin de Damas.'' Its lurid green-and-black cover featured a busty woman clutching a pistol, and its plot included the requisite car chases, explosions and sexual conquests. Unlike most paperbacks, though, this one attracted the attention of intelligence officers and diplomats on three continents. Set in the midst of Syria's civil war, the book offered vivid character sketches of that country's embattled ruler, Bashar al-Assad, and his brother Maher, along with several little-known lieutenants and allies. It detailed a botched coup attempt secretly supported by the American and Israeli intelligence agencies. And most striking of all, it described an attack on one of the Syrian regime's command centers, near the presidential palace in Damascus, a month before an attack in the same place killed several of the regime's top figures. ''It was prophetic,'' I was told by one veteran Middle East analyst who knows Syria well and preferred to remain nameless. ''It really gave you a sense of the atmosphere inside the regime, of the way these people operate, in a way I hadn't seen before.'' 
The book was the latest by Gיrard de Villiers, an 83-year-old Frenchman who has been turning out the S.A.S. espionage series at the rate of four or five books a year for nearly 50 years. The books are strange hybrids: top-selling pulp-fiction vehicles that also serve as intelligence drop boxes for spy agencies around the world. De Villiers has spent most of his life cultivating spies and diplomats, who seem to enjoy seeing themselves and their secrets transfigured into pop fiction (with their own names carefully disguised), and his books regularly contain information about terror plots, espionage and wars that has never appeared elsewhere. Other pop novelists, like John le Carrי and Tom Clancy, may flavor their work with a few real-world scenarios and some spy lingo, but de Villiers's books are ahead of the news and sometimes even ahead of events themselves. Nearly a year ago he published a novel about the threat of Islamist groups in post-revolutionary Libya that focused on jihadis in Benghazi and on the role of the C.I.A. in fighting them. The novel, ''Les Fous de Benghazi,'' came out six months before the death of the American ambassador, J. Christopher Stevens, and included descriptions of the C.I.A. command center in Benghazi (a closely held secret at that time), which was to become central in the controversy over Stevens's death. Other de Villiers books have included even more striking auguries. In 1980, he wrote a novel in which militant Islamists murder the Egyptian president, Anwar Sadat, a year before the actual assassination took place. When I asked him about it, de Villiers responded with a Gallic shrug. ''The Israelis knew it was going to happen,'' he said, ''and did nothing.''
Though he is almost unknown in the United States, de Villiers's publishers estimate that the S.A.S. series has sold about 100 million copies worldwide, which would make it one of the top-selling series in history, on a par with Ian Fleming's James Bond books. S.A.S. may be the longest-running fiction series ever written by a single author. The first book, ''S.A.S. in Istanbul,'' appeared in March 1965; de Villiers is now working on No. 197.
For all their geopolitical acumen, de Villiers's books tend to provoke smirks from the French literati. (''Sorry, monsieur, we do not carry that sort of thing here,'' I was told by the manager at one upscale Paris bookstore.) It's not hard to see why. Randomly flip open any S.A.S. and there's a good chance you'll find Malko (he is Son Altesse Sיrיnissime, or His Serene Highness), the aristocratic spy-hero with a penchant for sodomy, in very explicit flagrante. In one recent novel, he meets a Saudi princess (based on a real person who made Beirut her sexual playground) who is both a dominatrix and a nymphomaniac; their first sexual encounter begins with her watching gay porn until Malko distracts her with a medley of acrobatic sex positions. The sex lives of the villains receive almost equal time. Brutal rapes are described in excruciating physiological detail. In another recent novel, the girlfriend of a notorious Syrian general is submitting to his Viagra-fueled brutality when she recalls that this is the man who has terrorized the people of Lebanon for years. ''And it was that idea that set off her orgasm,'' de Villiers writes.
''The French elite pretend not to read him, but they all do,'' I was told by Hubert Vיdrine, the former foreign minister of France. Vיdrine is one of the unapologetic few who admit to having read nearly every one of Malko's adventures. He said he consulted them before visiting a foreign country, as they let him in on whatever French intelligence believed was happening there.
About 10 years ago, when Vיdrine was foreign minister, de Villiers got a call from the Quai d'Orsay, where the ministry is based, inviting him to lunch. ''I thought someone was playing a joke on me,'' de Villiers said. ''Especially because Vיdrine is a leftist, and I am not at all.'' When he went to the ministry at the scheduled time, Vיdrine was waiting for him in his private dining room overlooking the Seine.
''I am very happy to join you,'' de Villiers recalled telling the minister. ''But tell me, why did you want to see me?''
Vיdrine smiled and gestured for de Villiers to sit down. ''I wanted to talk,'' he said, ''because I've found out you and I have the same sources.''
De Villiers's books have made him very rich, and he lives in an impressively grand house on the Avenue Foch, a stone's throw from the Arc de Triomphe. I went there one day this winter, and after a short wait on the fourth-floor landing, a massive wooden door swung open, and I found myself facing a distinguished-looking man in brown tweeds with a long, bony face and pale brown eyes. De Villiers uses a walker -- a result of a torn aorta two years ago -- but still moves with surprising speed. He led me down a high-ceilinged hallway to his study, which also serves as a kind of shrine to old-school masculinity and kinky sex. I stood next to a squatting woman made of steel with a real MP-44 automatic rifle coming out of her crotch. ''That one is called 'War,' '' de Villiers said. In the middle of the floor was a naked female figure bending over to peek at the viewer from between her legs; other naked women, some of them in garters or chains, gazed out from paintings or book covers. On the shelves were smaller figurines in ivory, glass and wood, depicting various couplings and orgies. Classic firearms hung on the wall -- a Kalashnikov, a Tommy gun, a Winchester -- and books on intelligence and military affairs were stacked high on tables. Among the photos of him with various warlords and soldiers in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, I noticed a framed 2006 letter from Nicolas Sarkozy, praising the latest S.A.S. novel and saying it had taught him a great deal about Venezuela. ''He pretends to read me,'' de Villiers said, with a dismissive scowl. ''He didn't. Chirac used to read me. Giscard read me, too.''
After an hour or so, de Villiers led me downstairs to his black Jaguar, and we drove across town to Brasserie Lipp, a gathering spot for aging lions of the French elite. As we pushed through a thick crowd to our table, a handsome old man with a deeply tanned face called out to de Villiers from across the room. It was the great French nouvelle vague actor Jean-Paul Belmondo. He grinned and waved de Villiers over for a conspiratorial chat.
''That's Table No. 1,'' de Villiers said as we sat down. ''Mitterrand always used to sit there.'' After a waiter rushed up to help him into his seat, de Villiers ordered a suitably virile lunch of a dozen Breton oysters and a glass of Muscadet. He caught me looking at his walker and immediately began telling me about his torn aorta. He nearly died and had to spend three months in a hospital bed. ''If you fall off your horse, you have to get back on or you are dead,'' he said. He was able to maintain his usual publishing pace even while in the hospital. There was only one real consequence: he had used the real name of the C.I.A. station chief in Mauritania in his manuscript, and in the confusion after the accident, he forgot to change the final text. ''The C.I.A. was angry,'' he said. ''I had to explain. My friends at the D.G.S.E. [the French foreign-intelligence agency, General Directorate for External Security] apologized on my behalf, too.''
One of the many myths surrounding de Villiers is that he employs a team of assistants to help with his prodigious turnout. In fact, he does it all himself, sticking to a work routine that hasn't changed in half a century. For each book, he spends about two weeks traveling in the country in question, then another six weeks or so writing. The books are published on the same schedule every year: January, April, June, October. Six years ago, at age 77, de Villiers increased his turnout from four books a year to five, producing two linked novels every June. ''I'm not a sex machine, I'm a writing machine,'' he said.
De Villiers was born in Paris in 1929, the son of a wildly prolific and spendthrift playwright who went by the stage name Jacques Deval. He began writing in the 1950s for the French daily France Soir and other newspapers. Early on, during a reporting assignment in Tunisia, he agreed to do a favor for a French intelligence officer, delivering a message to some members of the right-wing pro-colonial group known as la main rouge. It turned out de Villiers was being used as a pawn in an assassination scheme, and he was lucky to escape with his life. He returned to Paris and confronted the officer, who was completely unrepentant. The incident taught him, he said, that ''intelligence people don't give a damn about civilian lives. They are cold fish.'' But rather than being turned off, de Villiers found that blend of risk and cold calculation seductive.
In 1964, he was working on a detective novel in his spare time when an editor told him that Ian Fleming, the creator of James Bond, had just died. ''You should take over,'' the editor said. That was all it took. The first S.A.S. came out a few months later. Although sales are down a bit since his peak in the 1980s, he still earns between 800,000 and a million euros a year (roughly $1 million to $1.3 million) and spends summers at his villa in St. Tropez, where he gads about on his boat by day and drives to parties in the evenings in his 1980s Austin Mini.
He has long been despised by many on the French left for his right-wing political views. ''We are all strangled by political correctness,'' he told me, and he used the word ''fags'' several times in our conversations. But his reputation as a racist and anti-Semite is largely myth; one of his closest friends is Claude Lanzmann, the Jewish leftist and director of ''Shoah,'' the landmark Holocaust documentary. And in recent years, de Villiers has gained a broader following among French intellectuals and journalists, even as his sales have slowed down. ''He has become a kind of institution,'' said Renaud Girard, the chief foreign correspondent of Le Figaro. ''You can even see articles praising him in Libיration,'' the left-leaning daily.
De Villiers created Malko, his hero, in 1964 by merging three real-life acquaintances: a high-ranking French intelligence official named Yvan de Ligniטres; an Austrian arms dealer; and a German baron named Dieter von Malsen-Ponickau. As is so often the case, though, his fiction proved prophetic. Five years after he began writing the series, de Villiers met Alexandre de Marenches, a man of immense charisma who led the French foreign-intelligence service for more than a decade and was a legend of cold-war spy craft. De Marenches was very rich and came from one of France's oldest families; he fought heroically in World War II, and he later built his own castle on the Riviera. He also helped create a shadowy international network of intelligence operatives known as the Safari Club, which waged clandestine battles against Soviet operatives in Africa and the Middle East. ''He was doing intelligence for fun,'' de Villiers told me. ''Sometimes he didn't even pick up the phone when Giscard called him.'' In short, de Marenches was very close to being the aristocratic master spy de Villiers had imagined, and as their friendship deepened in the 1970s, de Villiers's relationship with French intelligence also deepened and lasts to this day.
De Villiers has always had a penchant for the gruesome and the decadent. One of his models was Curzio Malaparte, an Italian journalist whose best-known book is ''Kaputt,'' an eerie firsthand account from behind the German front lines during World War II. Another was Georges Arnaud, the French author of several popular adventure books during the 1950s. ''He was a strange guy,'' de Villiers said. ''He once confessed to me that he started life by murdering his father, his aunt and the maid.'' (Arnaud was tried and acquitted for those murders, possibly by a rigged jury.) I couldn't help wondering whether Georges Simenon, the famously prolific and perverted Belgian crime writer, was also an influence. Simenon is said to have taken as little as 10 days to finish his novels, and he published about 200. He also claimed to have slept with 10,000 women, mostly prostitutes. De Villiers laughed at the comparison. ''I knew Simenon a little,'' he said, then proceeded to tell a raunchy story he heard from Simenon's long-suffering wife, involving roadside sex in the snow in Gstaad.
This seemed like a good moment to ask about de Villiers's own preoccupations. ''I've had a lot of sex in my life,'' he said. ''That's why I have so much trouble with wives. In America they would say I am a 'womanizer.' '' He has married four times and has two children, and now has a girlfriend nearly 30 years his junior, an attractive blond woman whom I met briefly at his home. When I suggested that the sex in S.A.S. was unusually hard-core, he replied with a chuckle: ''Maybe for an American. Not in France.''
One thing de Villiers does not have is serious literary ambitions. Although he is a great admirer of le Carrי, he has never tried to turn espionage into the setting for a complex human drama. He writes the way he speaks, in terse, informative bursts, with a morbid sense of humor. When I asked whether it bothered him that no one took his books seriously, he did not seem at all defensive. ''I don't consider myself a literary man,'' he said. ''I'm a storyteller. I write fairy tales for adults. And I try to put some substance into it.''
I had no idea what kind of ''substance'' until a friend urged me to look at ''La Liste Hariri,'' one of de Villiers's many books set in and around Lebanon. The book, published in early 2010, concerns the assassination of Rafiq Hariri, the former Lebanese prime minister. I spent years looking into and writing about Hariri's death, and I was curious to know what de Villiers made of it. I found the descriptions of Beirut and Damascus to be impressively accurate, as were the names of restaurants, the atmosphere of the neighborhoods and the descriptions of some of the security chiefs that I knew from my tenure as The Times' Beirut bureau chief. But the real surprise came later. ''La Liste Hariri'' provides detailed information about the elaborate plot, ordered by Syria and carried out by Hezbollah, to kill Hariri. This plot is one of the great mysteries of the Middle East, and I found specific information that no journalists, to my knowledge, knew at the time of the book's publication, including a complete list of the members of the assassination team and a description of the systematic elimination of potential witnesses by Hezbollah and its Syrian allies. I was even more impressed when I spoke to a former member of the U.N.-backed international tribunal, based in the Netherlands, that investigated Hariri's death. ''When 'La Liste Hariri' came out, everyone on the commission was amazed,'' the former staff member said. ''They were all literally wondering who on the team could have sold de Villiers this information -- because it was very clear that someone had showed him the commission's reports or the original Lebanese intelligence reports.''
When I put the question to de Villiers, a smile of discreet triumph flashed on his face. It turns out that he has been friends for years with one of Lebanon's top intelligence officers, an austere-looking man who probably knows more about Lebanon's unsolved murders than anyone else. It was he who handed de Villiers the list of Hariri's killers. ''He worked hard to get it, and he wanted people to know,'' de Villiers said. ''But he couldn't trust journalists.'' I was one of those he didn't trust. I have interviewed the same intelligence chief multiple times on the subject of the Hariri killing, but he never told me about the list. De Villiers had also spoken with high-ranking Hezbollah officials, in meetings that he said were brokered by French intelligence. One assumes these men had not read his fiction.
What do the spies themselves say about de Villiers? I conducted my own furtive tour of the French intelligence community and found that de Villiers's name was a very effective passe-partout, even among people who found the subject mildly embarrassing. Only one of those I spoke with, a former head of the D.G.S.E., said he never provided information to de Villiers. We met in a dim corridor outside his office, where we chatted for a while about other matters before the subject of de Villiers came up. ''Ah, yes, Gיrard de Villiers, I don't know him,'' he said, chuckling dismissively, as if to suggest that he had not even read the books. Then after a pause, he confessed: ''But one must admit that some of his information is very good. And in fact, one sees that it has gotten better and better in the past few novels.''
Another former spook admitted freely that he had been friends with de Villiers for years. We met at a cafe in Saint-Germain-des-Prיs on a cold, foggy afternoon, and as he sipped his coffee, he happily reeled off the favors he'd done -- not just talking over cases but introducing de Villiers to colleagues and experts on explosives and nuclear weapons and computer hacking. ''When de Villiers describes intelligence people in his book, everybody in the business knows exactly who he's talking about,'' he said. ''The truth is, he's become such a figure that lots of people in the business are desperate to meet him. There are even ministers from other countries who meet with him when they pass through Paris.''
A third former government official spoke of de Villiers as a kind of colleague. ''We meet and share information,'' he told me over coffee at a Paris hotel. ''I've introduced him to some sensitive sources. He has a gift -- a very strong intellectual comprehension of these security and terrorism issues.''
It is not just the French who say these things. De Villiers has had close friends in Russian intelligence over the years. Alla Shevelkina, a journalist who has worked as a fixer for de Villiers on a number of his Russian trips, said: ''He gets interviews that no one else gets -- not journalists, no one. The people that don't talk, talk to him.'' In the United States, I spoke to a former C.I.A. operative who has known de Villiers for decades. ''I recommend to our analysts to read his books, because there's a lot of real information in there,'' he told me. ''He's tuned into all the security services, and he knows all the players.''
Why do all these people divulge so much to a pulp novelist? I put the question to de Villiers the last time we met, in the cavernous living room of his Paris apartment on a cold winter evening. He was leaving on a reporting trip to Tunisia the next day, and on the coffee table in front of me, next to a cluster of expensive scotches and liqueurs, was a black military-made ammunition belt. ''They always have a motive,'' he said, absently stroking one of his two longhaired cats like a Bond villain at leisure. ''They want the information to go out. And they know a lot of people read my books, all the intelligence agencies.''
Renaud Girard, de Villiers's old friend and traveling companion, arrived at the apartment for a drink and offered a simpler explanation. ''Everybody likes to talk to someone who appreciates their work,'' he said. ''And it's fun. If the source is a military attachי, he can show off the book to his friends, with his character drawn in it.'' He also suggested that if the source happens to have a beautiful wife, she will appear in a sex scene with Malko, and some of them enjoy this, too. ''If you have read the books,'' he said, ''it's fun to enter the books.''
I asked de Villiers about his next novel, and his eyes lighted up. ''It goes back to an old story,'' he said. ''Lockerbie.'' The book is based on the premise that it was Iran -- not Libya -- that carried out the notorious 1988 airliner bombing. The Iranians went to great lengths to persuade Muammar el-Qaddafi to take the fall for the attack, which was carried out in revenge for the downing of an Iranian passenger plane by American missiles six months earlier, de Villiers said. This has long been an unverified conspiracy theory, but when I returned to the United States, I learned that de Villiers was onto something. I spoke to a former C.I.A. operative who told me that ''the best intelligence'' on the Lockerbie bombing points to an Iranian role. It is a subject of intense controversy at the C.I.A. and the F.B.I., he said, in part because the evidence against Iran is classified and cannot be used in court, but many at the agency believe Iran directed the bombing.
De Villiers excused himself to continue packing for Tunisia, after cheerfully delivering his cynical take on the Arab Spring. (''What this really means is the empowerment of the Muslim Brotherhood across the region.'') His views on other subjects are similarly curt and disillusioned. ''Russia? Russia is Putin. People fooled themselves with Medvedev that there would be change. I never believed it.'' And Syria? ''If Bashar falls, Syria falls. There is nothing else to hold that country together.''
Girard and I poured ourselves more Scotch, and he began reeling off stories of his and de Villiers's adventures together. Many of them involved one of de Villiers's former wives, who always seemed to show up in Gaza or Pakistan in wildly inappropriate dress. ''One time in the mid-'90s, we went to a Hamas stronghold together, and Gיrard had his wife with him, wearing a very provocative shirt with no bra,'' Girard said. ''There were young men there who literally started stoning us, and we had to flee.''
It was getting late, and Girard seemed to be running out of stories. ''He is 83 years old, and he is not slowing down,'' he said before we parted. ''He still goes to Mali and Libya, even after his heart troubles.'' He paused for a moment, looking into his Scotch. ''I remember one time during the rebellion in Albania, in 1997, we were sitting on a rooftop together, and we started talking about death. He told me: 'I will never stop. I will keep going with my foot on the accelerator until I die.' ''

Untouchable in Iraq, Ex-Sniper Dies in a Shooting Back Home

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ and MICHAEL SCHWIRTZ; Manny Fernandez reported from Houston, and Michael Schwirtz from New York. Julie Bosman contributed reporting from New York, and Thom Shanker from Washington.

HOUSTON -- From his perch in hide-outs above battle-scarred Iraq, Chris Kyle earned a reputation as one of America's deadliest military snipers. The Pentagon said his skills with a rifle so terrorized Iraqi insurgents during his four tours of duty that they nicknamed him the ''Devil of Ramadi'' and put a bounty on his head.
The insurgents never collected, and he returned home to become a best-selling author and a mentor to other veterans, sometimes taking them shooting at a gun range near his Texas home as a kind of therapy to salve battlefield scars, friends said. One such veteran was Eddie Ray Routh, a 25-year-old Marine who had served tours in Iraq and Haiti.
But on Saturday, far from a war zone, Mr. Routh turned on Mr. Kyle, 38, and a second man, Chad Littlefield, 35, shortly after they arrived at an exclusive shooting range near Glen Rose, Tex., about 50 miles southwest of Fort Worth, law enforcement authorities said Sunday. The officials said that for reasons that were still unclear, Mr. Routh shot and killed both men with a semiautomatic handgun before fleeing in a pickup truck belonging to Mr. Kyle. 
''Chad and Chris had taken a veteran out to shoot to try to help him,'' said Travis Cox, a friend of Mr. Kyle's. ''And they were killed.''
Mr. Routh was captured a few hours later near his home in Lancaster, a southern Dallas suburb, following a brief pursuit. He will be charged with two counts of capital murder, law enforcement officials said.
Friends of Mr. Kyle's said he had been well acquainted with the difficulties soldiers face returning to civilian life, and had devoted much of his time since retiring in 2009 to helping fellow soldiers overcome the traumas of war.
''He served this country with extreme honor, but came home and was a servant leader in helping his brothers and sisters dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder,'' said Mr. Cox, also a former military sniper. ''Everyone has their own inner struggles, but he was very proactive about the things he was dealing with.''
In 2011, Mr. Kyle created the Fitco Cares Foundation to provide veterans with exercise equipment and counseling. He believed that exercise and the camaraderie of fellow veterans could help former soldiers ease into civilian life.
Mr. Kyle, who lived outside of Dallas with his wife and their two children, had his own difficulties adjusting after retiring from the Navy SEALs. He was deployed in Iraq during the worst years of the insurgency, perched in or on top of bombed-out apartment buildings with his .300 Winchester Magnum. His job was to provide ''overwatch,'' preventing enemy fighters from ambushing Marine units.
He did not think the job would be difficult, he wrote in his book, ''American Sniper: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History.''
But two weeks into his time in Iraq, he found himself staring through his scope into the face of an unconventional enemy. A woman with a child standing close by had pulled a grenade from beneath her clothes as several Marines approached. He hesitated, he wrote, then shot.
''It was my duty to shoot, and I don't regret it,'' he wrote. ''My shots saved several Americans, whose lives were clearly worth more than that woman's twisted soul.''
Over time, his hesitation diminished and he became proficient at his job, credited with more than 150 kills. In his book, he describes shooting a fighter wielding a rocket launcher 2,100 yards away, a very long distance for a sniper and his farthest ever.
''Maybe the way I jerked the trigger to the right adjusted for the wind,'' he wrote. ''Maybe gravity shifted and put that bullet right where it had to be.''
''Whatever, I watched through my scope as the shot hit the Iraqi, who tumbled over the wall to the ground.''
Sheriff Tommy Bryant of Erath County said investigators were still sorting out how the three men had known one another and for how long, though he said Mr. Kyle and Mr. Littlefield had been friends. The authorities said the Saturday trip was the first time the three men had been out together at that shooting range. They said they did not know the motive for the killings.
''The suspect's mother was a schoolteacher for a long time,'' the sheriff said. ''She may have reached out to Mr. Kyle to try and help her son. We kind of have an idea that maybe that's why they were at the range, for some type of therapy that Mr. Kyle assists people with.''
In a news conference, the sheriff said: ''They all went out there together in the same vehicle. The suspect may have been suffering from some kind of mental illness from being in the military.''
Pentagon records show that Mr. Routh is currently a member of the Marine Reserves. He was an expert marksman and Marine corporal who had earned several medals, including a Marine good-conduct medal. He served in Iraq from September 2007 to March 2008, Pentagon officials said, and was currently listed as ''individual ready reserve,'' meaning he could be called back to active duty.
Sheriff's investigators said Mr. Routh was unemployed and since leaving active military duty had at least one arrest on a charge of driving while intoxicated.
Mr. Kyle's autobiography was published in January 2012 and became a nonfiction best seller. It turned Mr. Kyle into a celebrity, appearing on talk shows like ''Late Night With Conan O'Brien.''
The sudden success of the book surprised no one more than Mr. Kyle, the son of a church deacon who was initially rejected by the Navy when he tried to join in the mid-1990s, because of pins in his arm from a rodeo injury. His first book signing drew 1,200 people. About 850,000 print and e-book editions were sold.
In an interview with The New York Times in March, Mr. Kyle -- who received two Silver Stars and five Bronze medals for valor -- said he had hesitated to write about his experiences. But he was persuaded to move forward after hearing that other books about members of the SEALs were in the works.
''I wanted to tell my story as a SEAL,'' he said. ''This is about all the hardships that everybody has to go through to get the respect and the honor.''
But he also wanted his sense of humor to come out, he said, noting that he tried to ''write in a Texas drawl.''
At a book signing in Kerrville, Tex., last year, Bairbre Bible, a local resident, said Mr. Kyle took a break from signing autographs to share a hug and comforting words with her husband, Jerry, a Vietnam veteran still suffering from post-traumatic stress.
''Chris, just in that short meeting, was a very strong and compassionate person,'' Ms. Bible said. ''You felt a warmth and a special energy.''
Mr. Bible, 76, who has difficulty speaking, added, ''We shared personal pain.''
In gatherings with other veterans, friends said Mr. Kyle would deflect the praise of the inevitable well-wishers and play up the achievements of his comrades.
''He wasn't the American Sniper to all of his friends,'' Mr. Cox said. ''He was Chris Kyle and he was right alongside you. He was proud to be a veteran and he would do anything he could to serve veterans.''

Study Discovers Internal Trigger for Panic Attack in the Previously Fearless

BYLINE: By JAMES GORMAN

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 12

LENGTH: 751 words

In the past few years, scientists have learned a lot about fear from a woman who could not experience it. A rare illness had damaged a part of her brain known as the amygdala and left her eerily unafraid.
Both in experiments and in life, the woman, known as SM, showed no fear of scary movies, snakes, spiders or very real domestic assaults, death threats, and robberies at knife- and gunpoint.
Although she lived in an area ''replete with crime, drugs and danger,'' according to an earlier study, because she lacked a functioning amygdala, an evolutionarily ancient part of the brain long known to process fear, nothing scared her. 
But recently SM had a panic attack. And the simple fact that she was able to feel afraid without a working amygdala, experts say, illuminates some of the brain's most fundamental processes and may have practical value in the study of panic attacks.
SM's moments of fear occurred during an experiment that involved inhaling carbon dioxide through a mask in amounts that are not harmful but create a momentary feeling of suffocation. Not only SM, but two other women, identified as AM and BG, identical twins with amygdala damage similar to SM's, showed all the physical symptoms of panic, and reported that, to their surprise, they felt intense fear.
The researchers, who report on the experiment in the current issue of Nature Neuroscience, had hypothesized that SM would not panic. John A. Wemmie, a neuroscientist at the University of Iowa and the senior author of the paper, said, ''We saw the exact opposite.''
Antonio Damasio, of the University of Southern California, who had worked with SM and some of the researchers involved in this study on previous papers but did not participate in this research, said he was delighted with the results. It confirmed his own thinking, he said, that while the amygdala was central to fear generated by external threats, there was a different brain path that produced the feeling of fear generated by internal bodily experiences like a heart attack. This idea was put forth in a 2011 paper about SM on which he was a co-author.
''I think it's a very interesting and important result,'' he said.
Dr. Joseph E. LeDoux, of New York University, who has extensively studied the amygdala but was not involved in the research, said in an e-mail, ''This is a novel and important paper'' in an area where there is much left to learn. He said scientists still did not understand ''how the brain creates a conscious experience of fear,'' whether the amygdala or other systems are involved.
SM scores in the normal range on I.Q. and other tests, and she voluntarily participated in this and earlier studies, all of which showed her lacking in any sort of fear response until now. In one, for example, she walked through a Halloween haunted house and never gasped, recoiled or screamed, as others did, when a person in a costume leapt out of the dark. She also did not seem to learn fear from life experiences.
So what was so unusual about carbon dioxide?
The answer seems to lie in the way the brain monitors disturbances in the world outside the body -- snakes and robbers -- compared with the way it monitors trouble inside the body -- hunger, heart attacks, the feeling of not being able to breathe. External threats clearly are processed by the amygdala. But she had never been tested for internal signals of trouble.
In the experiment that SM and others participated in, they took one deep breath with plenty of oxygen but much more carbon dioxide than air usually contains. Humans are actually not sensitive to how much oxygen they are breathing, but they are sensitive to how much carbon dioxide is accumulating in the body, since it builds up quickly when a person cannot breathe. The sensation is familiar to people who have tried to hold their breath.
The researchers suggest that excess carbon dioxide produces signals that may be picked up in the brainstem and elsewhere, activating a fear-generating system in the brain that a venomous snake or a mugger with a gun would not set off.
One puzzling aspect of the results is that SM and the two other women all reacted so strongly. Among people with normal brains, only those with panic disorder are reliably terrified in carbon dioxide experiments. Most people are not so susceptible, said Colin Buzza, a co-author of the study and a medical student at the University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, suggesting that perhaps the amygdala is not functioning properly in people with panic disorder.

From State to State, Varied Responses to the Issue of Gun Violence

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 9

LENGTH: 1216 words

Although the debate over curbing gun violence after the massacre in Newtown, Conn., is breaking down mostly along partisan lines in the nation's statehouses -- with several Democratic governors calling for stricter gun laws and most Republicans urging tighter security or revamped mental health policies -- the handful of exceptions show the political and geographical complexities of the issue.
More than a dozen governors invoked the Newtown school shooting in their State of the State addresses in recent weeks, and most have weighed in on the shooting in other forums.
Several Democratic governors, mainly along the East Coast, are calling for banning some semiautomatic weapons or large-capacity magazines, while several Republican governors have pressed for other measures, noting their opposition to more restrictive gun laws. 
But the state-level debate has not always followed party lines.
Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a Republican who is mentioned as a possible presidential candidate, recently noted that he had long supported his state's laws, which he described as ''some of the toughest gun-control measures in place in the country.''
Gov. Mark Dayton of Minnesota, a Democrat, was quoted after the shooting as saying that his ''reading of the Constitution is that it provides a complete permission for any law-abiding citizen to possess firearms, whichever ones he or she chooses, and the ammunition to go with that.''
Another Democrat, Gov. Mike Beebe of Arkansas, is likely to sign a bill working its way through the Republican-controlled legislature that would allow people to take concealed handguns into churches that choose to allow them.
But a more traditional party-line approach is being taken elsewhere. Democratic governors in Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland and Massachusetts are among those calling for stricter gun laws, and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York has already won the passage of sweeping gun measures since the Newtown shooting.
''Who can watch the sad images of the last several weeks, who can see the pictures of those young faces, and honestly say that we are doing enough?'' Gov. Martin O'Malley of Maryland, a Democrat, asked in his State of the State address last week. Mr. O'Malley urged state lawmakers to ban the sale of ''military-style assault weapons,'' require licenses for buying handguns, bolster mental health treatment and information sharing, and spend more on school security.
Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, a Republican who took office this year, said in his speech that he would seek additional money in the state budget for ''a comprehensive school safety review,'' but he made it clear that he would oppose limiting access to guns.
''All of us were heartbroken after every parent's worst nightmare unfolded in Newtown, Conn.,'' said Mr. Pence, a former congressman. ''While others have rushed to the well-worn arguments over gun control, Hoosiers know this is not about access to firearms. It is about access to schools. Hoosiers have responsibilities to protect our kids, and Hoosiers have rights. We will protect our kids, and we will protect our rights.''
On the federal level, the Obama administration's push for stronger gun laws faces tough opposition in the Republican-controlled House and garnered a muted reaction even from the Senate's top Democrat.
Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, in an appearance Sunday on ABC's ''This Week,'' said, ''I want to get something done on guns.'' But on specific measures, his language was guarded.
He noted that he had opposed the 1994 ban on assault weapons but would consider one now. On restricting high-capacity magazines, he said, ''I think that's something we definitely have to take a look at.'' Regarding universal background checks, he said, ''Yeah, we need to increase that.''
But as a gun owner himself, Mr. Reid said he would not allow the influence of the National Rifle Association to prevent the Senate from acting.
As a polarized Washington debates President Obama's proposals, the state-level debate is also unfolding at an unusually partisan moment, with more states controlled by just one party than at any time in the past six decades. Republicans have the upper hand, holding the governor's office and legislative majorities in 24 states, while the Democrats control both the executive and legislative branches in just 13 states. The stark divide can be seen in many of the bills being weighed in states this year.
In Tennessee, which is controlled by Republicans, lawmakers have introduced bills that would allow school employees to carry guns, let people keep guns and ammunition locked in their cars in public and private parking lots, and bar state money from being used to enforce any new federal law or executive order that ''imposes restrictions on citizens who lawfully possess or carry firearms in this state.''
In heavily Democratic Massachusetts, Gov. Deval Patrick is calling for legislation to ban magazines containing more than seven rounds, require background checks for private gun sales and limit people to buying one gun a month. In his address to lawmakers, he said the proposals would ''help stop tragedies like Newtown or the recent shooting of a 13-year-old boy in Roxbury on his way to choir practice.''
Most Republicans said they had drawn other lessons from the Newtown shooting. Gov. Jan Brewer of Arizona, a Republican, said in her speech that ''the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary was unimaginable'' but rejected calls for stricter gun laws.
''Arizonans have reduced crime by punishing criminals, and not by infringing on the rights of law-abiding gun owners,'' she said.
Ms. Brewer focused instead on school safety, saying her budget would call for more money for school resource officers to provide security. ''Our job now is to take common-sense steps that lessen the likelihood of a similar tragedy striking Arizona -- while resisting the urge to turn a school into a fortress,'' she said.
Gov. C. L. Otter of Idaho alluded to the Newtown shooting in his address as he called for building a 579-bed mental health facility at a prison complex south of Boise.
''We all saw just a few weeks ago the terrible impact on a community and a nation when mental illness leads to tragedy,'' Mr. Otter said, echoing a commonly held belief, although the authorities have not described the mental state of Adam Lanza, the Newtown gunman, or said if he suffered from mental illness. Mr. Otter also ordered a review of school safety.
Some Democratic governors have said they are holding out hope for a federal law. Gov. Peter Shumlin of Vermont, the chairman of the Democratic Governors Association who was endorsed last year by the National Rifle Association Political Victory Fund, has opposed taking action on gun laws at the state level but has said he supports Mr. Obama's recommendations.
And Gov. Dannel P. Malloy of Connecticut, a Democrat who has said he would pursue measures on gun control, school safety and mental health in response to the shooting that killed 20 first graders and six educators in his state, said those issues must be addressed at the national level. ''As long as weapons continue to travel up and down I-95,'' he told lawmakers, ''what is available for sale in Florida or Virginia can have devastating consequences here in Connecticut.''

Service Is Held for School Bus Driver Who Tried to Prevent Kidnapping in Alabama

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 9

LENGTH: 675 words

OZARK, Ala. -- The service for the school bus driver had the feel of a state funeral.
Members of the local high school R.O.T.C., in their olive dress uniforms, stood in the parking lot of the Ozark Civic Center, directing the scores of cars into overflow parking lots. Sixty-two bikers with the Patriot Guard Riders rumbled into the streets around the civic center, and a half dozen of the riders flanked the entrance, holding American flags aloft.
''We come to funerals for veterans and first responders,'' said a spokesman for the Patriot Guard Riders, who gave his name as Mouse. 
Charles Albert Poland Jr., 66, was a veteran. Last week he was a first responder.
On Tuesday afternoon, Jimmy Lee Dykes, to whom Mr. Poland had given a gift of yard eggs and homemade jam days earlier, boarded Mr. Poland's bus and handed him a note demanding that he hand over two young children. Mr. Poland opened the emergency door in the rear of the bus and blocked Mr. Dykes's way as the children escaped. Mr. Dykes shot him four times and took a 5-year-old boy named Ethan, whom he has been holding in an underground bunker ever since.
Twenty children got away.
''You didn't deserve to die, though you died knowing that you kept everyone safe,'' wrote a student named Courtney H., whose letter the school superintendent read at Mr. Poland's service. ''Being on your bus has been the best times of my life.''
The hundreds of attendees came from all over the Wiregrass, as the southeastern corner of Alabama is known, a quiet, rural region where the main lines of work are growing peanuts or building helicopters. Neighbors of the Polands came, along with bus drivers from Florida; black-ribbon-draped school buses lined the route to the cemetery. Many came from the places in between, like Echo and Wicksburg and Skipperville.
''He was a county bus driver and I have a brother who's a coach in the county and an alternate bus driver, so he knew him,'' said Theresa Locke, 62, of Ozark. ''People in this area, everybody's connected in some way.''
Mr. Poland has been hailed as a national hero, as the speakers noted. But he was also a quiet and simple man whose wife, known as Mrs. Jan, had his coffee waiting for him every afternoon when he returned from his bus route. He would have been uncomfortable with all the attention and pomp, one speaker said. Within his coffin, which was draped with a flag, Mr. Poland was wearing no tie.
A dozen miles to the south, Mr. Dykes and Ethan remained in the underground bunker.
Law enforcement officials have kept all but silent on their efforts to rescue the boy. Uncertainty also surrounds Mr. Dykes's motives, other than what neighbors, as well as people familiar with Mr. Dykes's statements in the early hours of the kidnapping, said was a desire to air his grievances about the government, among other things.
Some neighbors have speculated that the timing was related to a coming court appearance; Mr. Dykes had been arrested on suspicion of firing a gun to scare a neighbor in December and was scheduled to be in court last Wednesday, the morning after his raid on the bus. But a seven-page letter that Mr. Dykes wrote by hand and circulated among witnesses and others involved in the case suggests little of what was to come.
In the letter, Mr. Dykes denied the charges, and he denied even having a handgun, saying it was the neighbor who should be facing legal action for driving recklessly on his property. He wrote at length about the effect of erosion on his land. But while Mr. Dykes was liberal with insults and charges of harassment, his anger was limited to the neighbors in the dispute.
At Mr. Poland's service, the Rev. Ray Layton asked what may have led to the violence of last week. Guns were not to blame, he said, but a nationwide movement away from God and prayer. He urged a change and believed it was possible, even in Mr. Dykes's case. When Mr. Dykes confronted Mr. Poland, Mr. Layton said, some may think that the Devil won.
''But,'' he added, ''I'm here to tell you the Devil picked on the wrong person this time.''

New Jersey's Useful One-Gun-a-Month Law

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; EDITORIAL; Pg. 18

LENGTH: 420 words

A New Jersey statute limits purchases of firearms in the state to one handgun a month, with some exceptions. The superintendent of state police, for instance, can exempt collectors or competitive shooters from the limit so they can buy a set of guns all at once. 
The National Rifle Association, through an affiliate, challenged the law on grounds that it was pre-empted by federal law and deprived gun buyers of due process. A federal district judge sensibly threw out the challenge, and last week, a unanimous three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit upheld that ruling.
In its pre-emption claim, the N.R.A. group said the New Jersey statute was trumped by a federal law that says states cannot prohibit the sale of BB and air guns. But the federal law does not prohibit states from regulating the sale of those guns, as the New Jersey statute does.
The group also said that gun collectors were deprived of due process because the statute required them to persuade a seller to take a gun off the market while a collector awaited approval, making the exemption ''illusory.'' But buyers are not guaranteed an exemption: it's up to the state to decide whether they should be given one; there is no due process breach in asking them to identify the guns they will buy if they do get an exemption.
New Jersey, whose gun-control laws are among the country's strongest, is one of three states with a one-gun-a-month law. According to the Harvard School of Public Health, about half of those who own guns have four or more. The real problem, however, is not hoarding by individuals but the fact that in states with little or no regulation, someone can accumulate enough guns to do a brisk trade with buyers in states with tougher laws.
The one-gun-a-month laws help by slowing the pace of weapon-gathering. In the four years before Virginia passed a one-gun law that took effect in 1993, 35 percent of guns recovered in criminal investigations in Northeastern states, from New Jersey through Massachusetts, came from Virginia. Two years later, the figure was 16 percent.
Virginia repealed the law last year, supposedly because it infringed on Second Amendment rights. It did not. As a group of scholars of constitutional law said in a statement last week about the right to have a firearm in the home, ''reasonable and limited measures to enhance public safety that do not unduly burden that right are consistent with the Second Amendment.'' This is plainly true of New Jersey's valuable one-gun law.

Lakers Are Again A Changed Team

BYLINE: By HOWARD BECK

SECTION: Section B; Column 0; Sports Desk; ON PRO BASKETBALL; Pg. 13

LENGTH: 848 words

The Los Angeles Lakers are returning to the New York stage, and it's anyone's guess what that portends: Dominance? Dysfunction? Brilliance? Petulance? All of the above? Some of the above?
The Lakers themselves probably couldn't tell you, so it's probably best not to spend much time predicting which version of the team will show up to play the Nets on Tuesday night at Barclays Center. They have already packed at least a half-dozen seasons into this one, which just passed its halfway point.
The Mike Brown Lakers (1-4) sputtered and gave way to the Bernie Bickerstaff Lakers (4-1), who looked moderately stable before giving way to the Mike D'Antoni Lakers (17-21), who have looked alternately miserable and capable. 
The Lakers had Steve Nash (0-2), lost him for seven weeks (12-12), then regained him (10-12).
Dwight Howard, the brooding star center, has drifted in and out of the offense. Pau Gasol, the enigmatic star forward, has drifted in and out of focus. Kobe Bryant has snarled, cajoled and fretted, summoning every ounce of talent and wisdom to keep the Lakers from plunging into the abyss.
Bryant and Howard have clashed. Gasol has gone from integral starter to depressed backup, while Earl Clark has gone from anonymous bench guy to starter. D'Antoni has struggled to pull it all together, failing to connect with Gasol and Howard.
Lately, Bryant and Nash have swapped scoring and playmaking roles, as if in some N.B.A. version of ''Freaky Friday.'' The realignment has paid dividends.
The Lakers who landed in New York on Monday had won five of their last six games, including a soul-cleansing 105-96 victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder on Jan. 27. Still, they were a startling four games under .500 (22-26) and three and a half games out of the playoff picture as they prepared to face the Nets (28-19).
''The Lakers are still the Lakers,'' Coach P. J. Carlesimo told reporters Monday. ''Whatever their record is right now, it's the Los Angeles Lakers.''
Easy for him to say.
The Lakers' four stars have played only 17 games together, for a not-so-grand total of 229 minutes. In addition to dealing with Nash's broken leg, the Lakers have had to overcome Gasol's sore knees, Howard's slow recovery from off-season back surgery and, more recently, Howard's injured right shoulder, which caused him to miss the last two games. The Lakers are listing Howard as day to day, leaving his status uncertain for Tuesday.
In an ESPN interview Monday, Howard said his back was only 75 percent recovered. He also acknowledged having problems with Bryant's shooting volume earlier in the season.
No one is complaining about Bryant's decision-making right now. For the last week and a half, he has been on a playmaking binge, dishing out 61 assists over six games while taking a relatively modest 84 shots. He began with back-to-back games of 14 assists and then put up 11, 9 and 8 over his next three outings, for the most assist-heavy five-game stretch of his long and glorious career.
Nash, meanwhile, has spent more time off the ball, spotting up for 3-pointers, which is not necessarily a bad thing, since he is a career .428 shooter from beyond the arc.
''The roles are all kind of upside down,'' Bryant told reporters last week.
Through Sunday, Bryant was still the N.B.A.'s third-leading scorer, at 27.7 points a game, having slipped from the top perch during this stretch. This season, he became the fifth player to cross the 30,000-point plateau. But he also has more assists (5,677) than anyone else in that club (Michael Jordan, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Karl Malone, Wilt Chamberlain).
''I was probably born a scorer, but I was made a winner, so I figure it out,'' Bryant told reporters last week. ''Whatever works, whatever wins championships, whatever wins games, that's what I do.''
So maybe the Lakers have found their winning formula, and they may yet return from the edge of oblivion, make the playoffs and reclaim some degree of respectability. They still need a healthy Howard, a confident Gasol and a lot of wins.
And Howard's pending free agency and unclear intentions loom as a continual threat to Lakers harmony. If there is any hint that Howard plans to walk away, the Lakers could be forced to trade him by the Feb. 21 deadline, rather than lose him for nothing.
Although General Manager Mitch Kupchak told Newsday on Monday that he would not trade Howard, that stance could change quickly if the season unravels again and Howard goes back to brooding.
A year ago, the Orlando Magic faced this predicament -- a toxic situation that finally ended when they traded Howard to Los Angeles in August. That deal ended the Nets' long pursuit of Howard which, as it turns out, might have been for the best. Brook Lopez has become an All-Star at center, without Howard's dominant defense but also without the drama.
The Nets say that they are happy with Lopez and that they are not pondering what might have been.
''I don't think about that,'' Deron Williams told reporters Monday. ''We're happy with Brook. We're happy with the team we have now. It's not a shoulda, woulda, coulda scenario.''

Standoff in Alabama Ends in Boy's Rescue and Kidnapper's Death

BYLINE: By ROBBIE BROWN and CAMPBELL ROBERTSON

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 11

LENGTH: 960 words

MIDLAND CITY, Ala. -- A six-day standoff between an angry and violent survivalist who held a 5-year-old boy hostage in an underground bunker and a legion of local, state and federal law enforcement officials ended on Monday with the death of the kidnapper and the freeing of the boy.
Stephen E. Richardson, the special agent in charge of the F.B.I.'s division in Mobile, told reporters that the boy, named Ethan, was rescued at 3:12 p.m. and that he ''appeared physically unharmed and is being treated at a local hospital.'' Mr. Richardson added, ''The subject is deceased.'' 
The subject was 65-year-old Jimmy Lee Dykes, who boarded a school bus last Tuesday afternoon, killed the driver and took the boy into a bunker he had installed in his backyard.
Neighbors speculated that Mr. Dykes had kidnapped the boy as part of a scheme to air his thoughts and grievances on a larger platform, and at a news conference earlier Tuesday, Sheriff Wally Olson of Dale County acknowledged that to be a major motive.
''Based on our discussions, he feels like he has a story that is important to him, although it's very complex,'' said the sheriff, who appeared wearier than in recent days.
Officials had been in constant communication with Mr. Dykes, speaking with him on a mobile phone and passing toys, food and coloring books into the bunker through a plastic pipe he had installed so he could hear any trespassers on his property. Officials had also been able to pass medication to Ethan, who was described as having Asperger's syndrome and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
In comments to reporters after the rescue, Mr. Richardson suggested that talks had recently broken down.
''Within the past 24 hours, negotiations deteriorated and Mr. Dykes was observed holding a gun,'' he said. ''At this point, F.B.I. agents, fearing the child was in imminent danger, entered the bunker and rescued the child.''
For some time, officials had been able to monitor movements within the bunker using high-tech surveillance equipment, said two people who had been briefed on the operation. They had also built a mock-up of the bunker nearby, where the authorities could test various options while devising a rescue plan.
On Monday afternoon, sensing that Mr. Dykes was becoming rattled and that the threat to the boy was growing, the authorities dropped two devices into the bunker that created loud explosions, heard by people across a highway. The explosions disoriented Mr. Dykes, and immediately afterward two or three members of the F.B.I. Hostage Rescue Team went into the bunker and retrieved the child. Mr. Dykes was killed.
Ethan and his mother were relieved to be reunited, Mr. Richardson said. ''He's laughing, joking, playing, eating -- the things that you would expect a normal 5- to 6-year-old young man to do. He's very brave. He's very lucky.''
Fears that the bunker might be booby-trapped appeared to be unfounded, but bomb experts were scouring the scene after the rescue.
The standoff began last Tuesday when Mr. Dykes approached a bus driven by Charles Albert Poland Jr., saying he wanted to give him some broccoli he had grown in his garden. The two knew each other; Mr. Poland had given Mr. Dykes a gift of eggs and homemade jam several days earlier. Once on the bus, Mr. Dykes handed Mr. Poland a note and demanded two children between the ages of 6 and 8.
Mr. Poland opened the emergency door in the back of the bus, and as the children escaped he blocked Mr. Dykes's way; Mr. Dykes shot him four times, killing him. Mr. Dykes then managed to take Ethan and set off the six-day siege.
''He was a very bad man, a terrible man,'' said Terrica Singletary, 14, who was among the 20 children who managed to flee the bus.
On Sunday, Mr. Poland was given a hero's funeral, with hundreds going to a civic center up the road to honor a small-town bus driver whom many of the attendees had never met.
The little community also began to learn about Mr. Dykes, who had moved onto a patch of property on the grassy hill about two years ago.
Neighbors of Mr. Dykes generally kept their distance, which he made easy. He frequently made violent threats to anyone who wandered onto his property, once even beating a neighbors' dog to death with a metal pipe. He would sometimes sit watching and holding a rifle when young children played in a nearby yard. Late into the night he would dig in the backyard of his travel trailer or patrol his property with a flashlight and a long gun.
When he did enter into conversations, they frequently involved conspiracies about the federal, state and local government, and the very forces he had brought down on himself when he kidnapped Ethan.
''What he's done the last seven days has been his own justification,'' said Jason Brogden, the lawyer for Midland City. ''By virtue of his own actions, his paranoia came to fruition.''
Throughout the standoff, there was talk of little else in southeastern Alabama, a mostly rural region called the Wiregrass. Over lunch at restaurants and even at a Super Bowl party in nearby Ozark, conversations would not roam far before returning to whether that little boy had gotten out yet and what that crazy man must be thinking.
Marquees in front of gas stations urged people to pray for Ethan and the family of Mr. Poland, the 66-year-old bus driver, and every night at a gazebo on the lawn of City Hall, people did just that, holding candles and concluding with a chorus of ''Amazing Grace.''
''This is exactly what we prayed for,'' said Pastor Michael Senn, a local minister, whose church owns a building where many of the schoolchildren fled after escaping from the bus. ''We're just a small community in the Bible Belt. What got us through this tragedy was the community pulling together and praying together.''

Debate Over Gun Control Is One-Sided in Idaho

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 12

LENGTH: 1037 words

BOISE, Idaho -- Somewhere in America, supposedly, there is a debate about regulating guns. But it is hard to find here.
In Idaho's graceful, striated-marble Capitol, home to one of the more ardent and adamant state legislatures in the nation in standing up for the Second Amendment, lawmakers from both parties say that a torrent of public passion, even panic, about new proposed federal gun rules is pushing in only one direction: toward more guns, not fewer.
If Idahoans, like Americans in many states, have rushed to buy guns out of fear for personal safety in the aftermath of recent mass shootings, or out of fear of tighter legal controls, then democracy has already spoken, many lawmakers said. People have voted with their pocketbooks. 
''Enable them to do what they believe is right,'' said State Senator Marv Hagedorn, a Republican who was designated to be his chamber's point man on proposed gun legislation in the session that began in January, describing what he sees as his mandate. ''There's a huge call to all of us to protect the Second Amendment rights.''
Every level of government in every state is, without question, looking more closely at issues of public safety since the slaughter in Newtown, Conn., of 20 children and 6 adults in an elementary school in December. But in deeply conservative states like Idaho, where President Obama got less than 33 percent of the vote in November -- one of his worst showings in the nation -- the discussion of school safety is occurring behind a kind of Chinese wall, separate from the question of whether certain types of guns or high-capacity magazines are to blame.
Some Democrats in the Republican-controlled Legislature are pushing for an expansion of mental health care spending this session -- Idaho has one of the highest suicide rates in the nation, mostly by gun -- but they are confronting, they said, the same torrent of fear and fury from constituents about a perceived threat from Washington to gun-owners' rights as their Republican colleagues.
The Idaho Department of Education has also been meeting to talk through the new terrain of school safety, even as some districts have said that they may move ahead on their own in allowing teachers and administrators to be openly armed, as Idaho law already permits.
''We've heard all sorts of things,'' said Matt McCarter, who, as the department's director of student engagement and postsecondary readiness, is leading the safety evaluation. Beyond talk of more guns, for example, he said he had heard from districts that were talking about attack dogs, and one that was pondering a kind of box mounted to the ceiling that could be dropped to trap an intruder.
''I said, 'Does it come with a moat?''' Mr. McCarter said.
Gov. C. L. Otter, who has asked for a report on school safety from the recently retired state police chief, said in an interview that allowing people the latitude to keep themselves and their local institutions safe -- a sentiment as old as the American frontier, now revived with new political impetus -- was the best way forward.
''For a long time, you couldn't carry a gun on an airplane -- now the pilots do,'' Mr. Otter said. ''The captain is in charge here. We've got to give him all the tools to make sure that he maintains control as he sees fit.''
Other authorities in other spheres of life, he added, have the same responsibilities as pilots. ''The captains of the home are the parents. The captains of the schools are the people that run the schools. So, you know, I see a lot of similarities there.''
Consider another measure of the moment: the 7 a.m. information session on gun laws for lawmakers held by the Idaho Sheriff's Association recently in a Capitol basement meeting room. The House majority leader, Mike Moyle, sitting near the back, made the point, for example, that federal authorities were establishing a pattern of enforcing some laws and not others. In Washington and Colorado, where voters have approved legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana, he said, federal authorities are indicating a willingness to look the other way, even though marijuana possession remains a federal crime.
Was it possible, Mr. Moyle asked, to keep new federal gun regulations from being enforced in Idaho? ''If they're picking and choosing what they're going to enforce, does the state have any control on the other side, picking and choosing on what we're going to let them enforce?''
Probably not, said the group's moderator, Mike Kane, a former prosecutor and now a lobbyist for the Sheriff's Association. ''As much as I do understand the sentiment, there is no way that I know legally that would hold up,'' Mr. Kane said.
The State House has also named Representative Judy Boyle, a Republican, to act as its leader on the gun issue this year. She and Mr. Hagedorn -- the gun issue's point man in the Senate -- have known each other for years, she said, through hunting clubs or their membership in the National Rifle Association. Before running for office, she volunteered for the N.R.A. to help pass the state's concealed weapons law in 1990. Republicans now have a 28-to-7 majority over Democrats in the Idaho Senate, and hold a 57-to-13 majority in the House.
Ms. Boyle said one idea that intrigued her was encouraging more advanced weapons training for teachers or other school workers. Mr. Otter also mentioned a gun club in Utah that recently began offering weapons training to teachers. ''Two hundred showed up,'' he said.
Under current Idaho law, no concealed weapons are allowed in schools, but local school boards, at their discretion, can allow people to carry them openly. Being elected to any office in Idaho, from the county highway district commissioner up to the governor, automatically comes with a right to carry a concealed weapon. Mr. Otter said in an interview that he has chosen not to.
The speaker of the House, Scott Bedke, a Republican, said that he would not guess what might come from the session, but that the will of the people was clear.
''Idaho will push back,'' he said, referring to federal gun control proposals. ''A question that is rolling around in most Idahoan's heads right now is, What part of 'shall not be infringed' don't they get?''

In Words and Unmistakable Song, Koch's Bond With City Is Celebrated

After the eulogies by a mayor and a former president, after the loving references to ''Uncle Eddie'' by a 17-year-old grandnephew, after the coffin had been lifted on the shoulders of the Police Department's ceremonial unit, the 10,000-pipe organ in Temple Emanu-El played a piece that is not usually heard at a funeral, but that seemed singularly appropriate for the funeral of Edward I. Koch: ''New York, New York.''
The song was written by John Kander and Fred Ebb in 1977, the year Mr. Koch was elected mayor, and as his coffin was carried down the center aisle and the organ swelled from pianissimo to full-fledged forte, the mourners broke into applause for the city's 105th mayor. Mr. Koch died at 88 on Friday.
''No mayor, I think, has ever embodied the spirit of New York City like he did,'' Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg told the mourners, ''and I don't think anyone ever will. Tough and loud, brash and irreverent, full of humor and chutzpah -- he was our city's quintessential mayor.'' 
In the pews was a Who's Who of the New York that Mr. Koch led for three terms -- and the New York he commented on in the 23 years after he left office. The congregation was part familiar names, part lesser knowns who had worked in government, and part onetime adversaries who had tangled with Mr. Koch but seemed to have patched things up.
Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said Mr. Koch had been so angry when he advised the mayor not to run for a fourth term in 1989 that Mr. Koch endorsed Mr. Schumer's opponent, Alfonse M. D'Amato, an incumbent and a Republican, in 1998. As things turned out, Mr. Koch lost the Democratic primary to David N. Dinkins, who went on to defeat Rudolph W. Giuliani in the November election, and Mr. Schumer beat Mr. D'Amato.
''I invited him to my swearing-in, and I said, 'Let's let bygones be bygones,' '' Mr. Schumer said, ''and we've been friends ever since.''
Mr. Dinkins attended the service, as did former Mayor Giuliani, who as the United States attorney in Manhattan in the 1980s had pursued corruption cases that shook the Koch administration. But Mr. Koch was never implicated, and James F. Gill, a lawyer at a firm Mr. Koch joined after he was mayor, said Mr. Koch's ''most cherished possession was his reputation for honesty and integrity.''
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and former President Bill Clinton chatted after the service. What they said is unknown, because reporters could not hear them. But as they parted, Mr. Cuomo, who was housing secretary in the Clinton administration, said, ''Nice to see you, Bill.''
He put out his hand, saying, ''Tell Hillary I said hello.'' Hillary Rodham Clinton, who stepped down as secretary of state last week, is widely seen as a possible Democratic presidential candidate in 2016. So is Mr. Cuomo.
Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, said that Mr. Koch had frequently offered her advice, but that ''at the end of every conversation he would say, 'Just do what you want, and if people don't like it, just bleep 'em.' ''
Former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who lost to Mr. Koch in the 1977 mayoral voting but defeated him five years later in the Democratic primary for governor, also attended the service, as did former Gov. George E. Pataki, the Republican who defeated the elder Mr. Cuomo in 1994.
Mr. Koch was remembered for his life before City Hall -- as a congressman from Manhattan -- and for his life after, as a movie reviewer, author and political gadfly. Some in the crowd seemed surprised that the service lasted little more than an hour.
''We were told not to speak long,'' Mr. Clinton said. He held up a bundle of papers as if it were the text of the eulogy he was about to give.
He assured the mourners it was not. ''These are the letters I got from Ed Koch when I was president,'' he said, recalling advice Mr. Koch had given him, solicited and unsolicited, on domestic issues like gun control and on foreign policy.
''He had a big brain,'' Mr. Clinton said, ''but he had a bigger heart.''
Mr. Bloomberg said Mr. Koch had rescued the spirit of the city after its brush with bankruptcy and the disastrous summer of 1977, with the Son of Sam shootings and a blackout that was followed by looting. Mr. Bloomberg said that by the time he got into politics years later, Mr. Koch was ready with advice, drawing laughter at one example.
''I remember the time we were talking about how to tackle obesity, and he said, 'Limit the size of sugary drinks, no one will notice.' '' (Mr. Bloomberg's restrictions on large sodas, set to take effect next month, have aroused outrage in some quarters and are being challenged in court by the soft-drink industry.)
Several of Mr. Koch's relatives -- the children and grandchildren of his sister, Pat Koch Thaler -- delivered tributes, offering a glimpse of the private side of a public figure.
Noah Thaler, Mr. Koch's grandnephew, recalled a devoted uncle who had attended youngsters' school events and soccer games, family holiday dinners, a Cirque du Soleil performance (where, he said, they ran into Mr. Clinton, and his proud Uncle Eddie bragged about him), even a manicure last year with Mr. Koch's grandniece Hannah.
Other relatives marveled at Mr. Koch's ability to walk into one of their apartments, lie down on a couch and fall asleep instantly -- and to wake up just as fast.
''While he knew he was often portrayed as a lonely bachelor, it didn't matter,'' Mr. Thaler said. ''He saw in his family only perfection.''
Mr. Koch was buried at Trinity Church Cemetery in northern Manhattan. He chose it so that he would not have to leave Manhattan. ''Just think about it: a Polish Jew in an Episcopal graveyard in a largely Dominican neighborhood,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''What could be more New York -- or even more Ed Koch?''
After the service, the coffin was lifted into a hearse on Fifth Avenue, which was closed, as were side streets near Temple Emanu-El.
''The ultimate New York tribute -- a traffic jam,'' said Randall Bourscheidt, who was the deputy commissioner of cultural affairs in the Koch administration.

Hand of U.S. Is Seen in Halting General's Rise

BYLINE: By GINGER THOMPSON, RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD and ERIC SCHMITT; Ginger Thompson reported from New York, Randal C. Archibold from Mexico City, and Eric Schmitt from Washington. Lisa Schwartz and Kitty Bennett contributed research.

As Mexico's military staged its annual Independence Day parade in September, spectators filled the main square of Mexico City to cheer on the armed forces. Nearly 2,000 miles away in Washington, American officials were also paying attention.
But it was not the helicopters hovering overhead or the antiaircraft weapons or the soldiers in camouflage that caught their attention. It was the man chosen to march at the head of the parade, Gen. Moisיs Garcםa Ochoa, who by tradition typically becomes the country's next minister of defense.
The Obama administration had many concerns about the general, including the Drug Enforcement Administration's suspicion that he had links to drug traffickers and the Pentagon's anxiety that he had misused military supplies and skimmed money from multimillion-dollar defense contracts.
In the days leading up to Mexico's presidential inauguration on Dec. 1, the United States ambassador to Mexico, Anthony Wayne, met with senior aides to President Enrique Peסa Nieto to express alarm at the general's possible promotion. 
That back-channel communication provides a rare glimpse into the United States government's deep involvement in Mexican security affairs -- especially as Washington sizes up Mr. Peסa Nieto, who is just two months into a six-year term. The American role in a Mexican cabinet pick also highlights the tensions and mistrust between the governments despite proclamations of cooperation and friendship.
''When it comes to Mexico, you have to accept that you're going to dance with the devil,'' said a former senior D.E.A. official, who requested anonymity because he works in the private sector in Mexico. ''You can't just fold your cards and go home because you can't find people you completely trust. You play with the cards you're dealt.''
A former senior Mexican intelligence official expressed similar misgivings about American officials. ''The running complaint on the Mexican side is that the relationship with the United States is unequal and unbalanced,'' said the former official, who, like others interviewed for this article, spoke anonymously to discuss diplomatic and security exchanges. ''Mexico is open with its secrets. The United States is not. So there's a lot of resentment. And there's always an incentive to try to stick it to the Americans.''
Wave of Violence
Washington's concerns about General Garcםa Ochoa -- which several officials cautioned were not confirmed -- come as both governments grasp for new ways to stem the illegal flows of drugs, guns and money across their borders.
Under Mr. Peסa Nieto's predecessor, Felipe Calderףn, cooperation between the two governments had expanded in ways once considered unthinkable, with American and Mexican agents conducting coordinated operations that resulted in the capture or killing of several dozen important cartel leaders. But while Washington highlighted the record numbers of arrests, the stepped-up campaign created a wave of violence in Mexico that left some 60,000 people dead.
The devastating death toll has Mr. Peסa Nieto, 46, a former governor, promising to move his country's fight against organized crime in a different direction, focusing more on reducing violence than on detaining drug kingpins. But he has so far offered only vague details of his security plans, focusing instead on social and economic programs.
While Mr. Peסa Nieto portrays himself as the leader of a new generation of reformers, he is also a scion of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which ruled Mexico for more than 70 years through a combination of corruption and coercion until it lost power in 2000. During its time in power, the party was known more for keeping the United States at arm's length while attempting to strike deals with drug traffickers, rather than combating them head on.
Mr. Peסa Nieto's election has brought the PRI back to power, and since so many of those serving in his cabinet have one foot in the past, foreign policy experts who specialize in Mexico say it is not clear where the new government is headed.
''It could go either way,'' said Eric L. Olson of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, speaking of future cooperation between Mexico and the United States. ''Part of me says, 'Let's not assume it's all going to go south.' And there are things that are happening that give me hope. But the longer it goes without some clarity, the more doubts creep in.''
Those doubts have also crept to Capitol Hill. Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a Democrat from Vermont who sits on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said he was withholding nearly $230 million in security assistance to Mexico through the so-called Merida Initiative amid concerns about whether the fight against organized crime is doing more harm than good.
''Congress has been asked for a significant new investment, but it's not clear what the Mexican government's plans are,'' Mr. Leahy said. ''It's premature to sign off on more of the same.''
General Garcםa Ochoa, 61, whose background is at once exemplary and enigmatic, personifies that quandary. On paper, he is a model officer. He earned two advanced degrees from Mexico's most prestigious military academies, and founded the elite National Center for Counter-Narcotics Intelligence. He has been a student and an instructor in American military training programs. He has written three books, including one on the military's role in the drug fight.
People who know the general said they were struck by his candid assessments of the fight against organized crime. He spoke openly about governmental corruption, a topic that has been considered taboo. And on at least two occasions over the past year and a half, the general's friends said, he traveled secretly to San Antonio to meet with American intelligence officials -- he didn't feel safe meeting with agents in Mexico, they said -- and gave names of military and civilian officials he suspected of providing protection to drug traffickers.
''He was genuinely worried that corruption was giving the military a bad name, and that if nothing was done about it, it could hurt relations with the United States,'' said a person knowledgeable about the meetings. ''The way he saw it, this next government has the chance to really change the way Mexico works with the United States. He didn't want that chance to be missed.''
By then, General Garcםa Ochoa was already on the short list to become defense minister. And people who know him said he hoped American support would give him an advantage over other candidates.
What he did not know was that the United States was quietly advocating against him. Current and former American officials said they had put together a troubling portfolio of allegations against the general. In his role as director of military administration and acquisitions, he had been accused of skimming money and supplies from large defense contracts.
Reports in the Mexican news media last summer accused the general of approving payments totaling more than $355 million for sophisticated surveillance equipment, without reporting those payments to civilian authorities or providing an explanation of how that equipment would be used.
'Mr. Ten Percent'
Behind the scenes, American officials had nicknamed the general ''Mr. Ten Percent,'' shorthand for their suspicions about the way he handled contracts. And two American officials recalled the general making a formal request for American assistance for the military's helicopter unit, and then backing out of the arrangement when the United States asked to look at the books -- including the unit's financial, flight and fuel records.
''The United States is sending a lot of money down there,'' said one senior American official, describing the concerns about the general. ''We need to be sure that money is being used in the right way or we could lose a huge opportunity.''
The D.E.A. suspected the general had long ties to drug traffickers. Agents declined to discuss the specific nature of those links. Nor would they say whether their investigation against the general was continuing. General Garcםa Ochoa declined requests to be interviewed.
''There was a lot of information on him, and it was coming from multiple sources,'' said a recently retired senior federal law-enforcement officer, referring to what he called the ''serious concerns'' about the general. ''We never found any smoking guns, not enough to make a case.''
The New York Times obtained classified D.E.A. intelligence reports from the early years of the general's career, when he founded the counternarcotics intelligence center. The reports, dated Dec. 15, 1997, allege that then-Colonel Garcםa Ochoa was one of several senior Mexican military officials involved with attempts to negotiate a deal with the country's most powerful drug trafficking organizations.
''It is highly likely,'' said one report, ''that military officials wanted to continue to profit from an ongoing relationship with the drug traffickers.''
The reports also allege that the colonel led a raid against the Juבrez Cartel in which he deliberately allowed the kingpin Amado Carrillo Fuentes to escape, saying that the colonel ''did not give orders to launch the operation until the car in which ACF was reportedly traveling had departed the area.''
Mexican officials declined requests to be interviewed for this article. American officials declined to comment publicly on their suspicions about the general. But they emphasized that whatever concerns they might have had about an individual general were hardly representative of the larger relationship between the two governments.
There have been significant strides in cooperation in recent years, including the first drones flying over Mexican airspace, the creation of the first joint intelligence center on a Mexican military base, operations staged by Mexican counternarcotics officers on the United States side of the border, and operations conducted by American federal law enforcement agents against money laundering in Mexico.
The United States has successfully shared delicate intelligence with the Mexican Navy, which led to the arrests of significant cartel leaders. And the number of exchanges between the Pentagon and the Mexican military has increased drastically, from 3 events in 2009 to nearly 100 last year, according to a report in Small Wars Journal, an independent online military publication.
''One of the most important bilateral relationships the United States has is with Mexico, and neither side is going to abandon it,'' said another former senior D.E.A. official. ''Yes, there are significant concerns, but when they come up you try to isolate them, limit their impact and move on.''
The American effort to prevent General Garcםa Ochoa's promotion was just such an exercise in containment, with the Americans quietly moving to weed out Mexican officials suspected of corruption because they feared Mexican institutions would not be willing or able to do so on their own.
Misgivings Aired
After September's Independence Day parade, senior American officials gathered in Mexico City for two days of meetings to assess their suspicions about the general, and to discuss whether or not to share those misgivings with their Mexican counterparts.
According to a Mexican official, the Americans eventually did share their concerns about the general, less than a week before Mr. Peסa Nieto announced his cabinet appointments. The official said the American ambassador met in Mexico City with two senior aides to the incoming leader, including Miguel ֱngel Osorio Chong, who later became interior minister, and Jorge Ramםrez Marin, a former national security adviser.
The official said Mr. Wayne, the ambassador, had discussed Washington's concerns about the general, emphasizing that the allegations had not been corroborated.
''The timing was important,'' the Mexican official said, ''because Mexican presidents almost never replace the person they appoint as defense minister, so whoever was chosen would be involved with setting the terms of cooperation for the next six years.''
In the end, General Garcםa Ochoa did not get the job. Instead, it went to Gen. Salvador Cienfuegos Zepeda, who Mexican officials said had become close with Mr. Peסa Nieto when he served as governor of the state of Mexico and General Cienfuegos commanded the area's military base.
As for General Garcםa Ochoa, he was dispatched to a military base in the northern border state of Coahuila, a hotbed of cartel-related prison breaks, police corruption and political assassinations.
Whether Washington played a central role in how things turned out for the general remains unclear. Meanwhile, a column in the Mexican newspaper El Universal debated whether his dangerous new assignment was a demonstration of the government's confidence in him, or a demotion aimed at forcing him to consider an early retirement.
Whichever the case, the general made a hasty departure from the military's headquarters in Mexico City. One person who knows him said he had emptied his office with the help of a handful of aides and dispensed with the usual farewell festivities.
On a day in December when defense ministers from across the hemisphere gathered for a summit meeting in Mexico City, the general was seen wearing civilian clothes, climbing into his personal car and driving away.

Obama Presses for Gun Measures, Offering Up Minneapolis as a Model

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 11

LENGTH: 1052 words

MINNEAPOLIS -- President Obama traveled to the nation's heartland on Monday to press his case for tougher national gun laws, even as he appeared to acknowledge that expanded background checks on gun sales were far more likely to pass Congress than a ban on military-style assault weapons.
In a city once called ''Murderapolis'' for its homicide rate in the 1990s, the president cited successful gun-violence prevention efforts here as evidence that new national laws are needed to reduce the number of shootings across the country. 
''The only way we can reduce gun violence in this country is if the American people decide it's important,'' Mr. Obama said, standing in front of a sea of police officers and sheriff's deputies at the Minneapolis Police Department Special Operations Center.
Mr. Obama renewed his call for Congress to pass a series of measures, including a ban on the manufacture and sale of new assault weapons, limits on high-capacity magazines and an expansion of the criminal background check system that currently covers only about 60 percent of gun sales.
But he openly demonstrated different expectations for the measures as Washington wages a bitterly divisive debate over the role of guns in society.
The president declared ''universal background checks'' to be supported by a ''vast majority of Americans'' and called for their quick passage in Congress. ''There's no reason why we can't get that done,'' he told the gathering of law enforcement officials.
But of the potential for a new assault weapons ban, the president said only that it ''deserves a vote in Congress because weapons of war have no place on our streets.''
On Monday, White House aides again said the president was still pushing for the three measures, along with changes to the nation's mental health system. But the president, top lawmakers in Congress and gun-control advocacy organizations appear nervous about the political chances of the assault weapons ban and eager to push for a better background check system.
''There definitely seems to be a significant convergence around the idea of universal background checks,'' said Dan Gross, the president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, though he added, ''I think there is still a significant outcry on the part of the American public to talk about assault weapons.''
On Sunday, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, said he might not even personally support an assault weapons ban, though he promised that senators would get a chance to vote on it. During the Super Bowl on Sunday, an important gun-control group broadcast a television advertisement in Washington focused exclusively on pushing for better background checks.
The ad, from Mayors Against Illegal Guns, notes that the National Rifle Association once supported such checks. The ad concludes with a child saying: ''America can do this. For us. Please.''
The focus on background checks reflects a broad political calculation in Washington that there is more public support for requiring the checks than for limits on guns and ammunition. A recent New York Times/CBS News survey found that 92 percent of those polled backed broader background checks.
The same survey found that 53 percent supported a ban on some semiautomatic weapons and that 63 percent would support limits on magazines.
John Feinblatt, a top adviser to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, said it was ''widely acknowledged'' that an effective assault weapons ban would be a tougher fight. He compared the background check system to an airport that has two lines -- one with security and one without.
''That's pretty much the system that we have,'' Mr. Feinblatt said.
But some advocates of tougher gun laws say that Mr. Obama and his allies in Congress should not give up pushing for the three measures, regardless of the opposition that the measures are likely to face from the N.R.A. and other gun rights groups.
R. T. Rybak Jr., the mayor of Minneapolis, mocked politicians in Washington who are unwilling to support an assault weapons ban.
''Oh, it's not going to pass,'' Mr. Rybak said. ''Well, guess what? People are dying out here, and I'm not satisfied with the lame kind of response that we've gotten from some of the people in Washington who look at this like some kind of game.''
Mr. Rybak, a Democrat, said he would not be satisfied by a compromise on gun control measures that did not address assault weapons and focused only on background checks.
''I don't think any of us should accept anything other than complete effort and knocking off the political wimpsmanship that I think too often takes place around these issues,'' he said. ''Get a spine. Get a backbone because people are losing their lives.''
In the 1990s, Minneapolis experienced an explosion of drug- and gang-related violence, which led to a series of local measures aimed at reducing gun violence that has brought down the city's murder rate.
The city has developed programs directed at rehabilitating young people who have committed violent crimes, and its leaders are pushing for faster and more comprehensive state background checks for people buying guns.
Janeי Harteau, the Minneapolis police chief, noted that violent crime persists, mentioning two children who were recently killed by stray bullets in the city. Mr. Obama cited the city's overall success in reducing crime as proof that new laws could make a difference even if they could not eliminate the threat of all shootings.
''When it comes to protecting our children from gun violence, you've shown that progress is possible,'' Mr. Obama said. ''We don't have to agree on everything to agree that it's time to do something. That's my main message here today.''
Aides said that Mr. Obama had met privately with law enforcement officials, as well as state and local political officials and community leaders responsible for those efforts Monday before his remarks.
Among the officials Mr. Obama met were Gov. Mark Dayton, Mr. Rybak, Ms. Harteau and Richard Stanek, the sheriff of Hennepin County. Eric H. Holder Jr., the attorney general, also attended the meeting.
Before the meeting started, Mr. Rybak praised the president.
''We just have tremendous admiration for you carrying a tough political load,'' the mayor said, adding, ''we still need common-sense law changes in Washington.''

Man, in Third Trial, Is Convicted of 2002 Rampage at a Bar

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

LENGTH: 272 words

In his third trial, a Brooklyn man was convicted on Monday of shooting three people and dousing others with kerosene in 2002 at an East Village bar. 
A jury in State Supreme Court found the man, Steven Johnson, 45, guilty of charges including attempted murder, assault and kidnapping as a hate crime, the Manhattan district attorney's office said. Mr. Johnson is scheduled to be sentenced on March 8.
''This was a hateful and meticulously planned attack on innocent victims,'' the district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., said. ''The defendant terrorized a roomful of people, who showed tremendous courage during an extraordinarily harrowing ordeal.''
Mr. Johnson invaded the Manhattan bar, Bar Veloce, which had more than a dozen patrons inside, on June 16, 2002. He was carrying three pistols, a samurai sword and a container of kerosene.
He later told the police he had left his Brooklyn housing project and taken the subway to the East Village, where he looked for ''happy'' white people to avenge the mistreatment of black people.
Mr. Johnson, who is black, shot and wounded three people and sprayed kerosene on several customers while shouting racial epithets and threatening to set them on fire. Two women caught Mr. Johnson off guard and tackled him, and a policeman shot him.
It was Mr. Johnson's third trial. The first trial deadlocked in 2004. The second trial in 2007 resulted in a conviction and a 240-year prison sentence, but was overturned on a technicality on appeal. During the second trial, Mr. Johnson's lawyer asked the judge to consider his client's mental disorders and the fact that he had been sexually abused as a child.

LANCASTER, Tex. -- On Saturday, when Chris Kyle, a retired Navy SEAL sniper, parked his truck outside Eddie Ray Routh's house in this Dallas suburb, the two men were virtual strangers. Their plan was to spend the afternoon at a remote shooting range, one of Mr. Kyle's techniques for helping struggling veterans adjust to civilian life.
But by the evening, the police had arrested Mr. Routh, charging him with the shooting deaths of Mr. Kyle and another man, Chad Littlefield. 
Mr. Kyle's friends said he did not know Mr. Routh well -- Mr. Kyle became lost trying to find the house, and had to ask a neighbor for directions -- but he knew Mr. Routh's mother, Jodi Routh, who had recently asked for help for her son, a former Marine who spent 15 days in a nearby jail last year after a drunken-driving arrest, and who the authorities said had a history of mental illness.
It was not unusual for Mr. Kyle, 38, to spend time counseling troubled veterans. But another reason Mr. Kyle may have agreed to help Mr. Routh was that they shared connections beyond the battlefield. Mr. Kyle and Mr. Routh, 25, attended the same high school 14 years apart in Midlothian, a woodsy suburb of 18,000 about 25 miles southwest of Dallas. Mr. Kyle lived there with his wife and two children, and Mr. Routh's mother is an educational aide for the local public school district.
Mr. Kyle and Mr. Routh arrived at the Erath County shooting range on Saturday with Mr. Kyle's friend Mr. Littlefield, 35.
The authorities on Monday were trying to piece together what happened next, but said that it seemed that Mr. Routh turned on the two men, shooting both multiple times with a semiautomatic handgun and fleeing in Mr. Kyle's truck before his arrest near his home here. But court documents suggest that Mr. Routh may have wanted to steal Mr. Kyle's truck, a black Ford F-350 pickup with large tires and rims. Shortly before his arrest, Mr. Routh told his sister and brother-in-law that he had killed the two men and ''traded his soul for a new truck,'' according to an arrest affidavit.
The shootings unfolded five months after the Lancaster police responded to the Routh residence in September. At that time, Mr. Routh threatened to kill himself and his family, according to a police report of the episode. Officers found him near his home, shirtless and shoeless, and he told them he was a Marine veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder, the report said.
His mother told officers that he had been drinking and had become upset when his father told him he was going to sell his gun. Mr. Routh was taken into protective custody and transported to a Dallas psychiatric hospital.
Mr. Kyle, whose skill as a sharpshooter made him known as one of the military's deadliest snipers and whose autobiography became a best seller, devoted much of his time to helping disturbed and disabled veterans. He created a foundation to help them overcome post-traumatic stress disorder by providing exercise equipment and counseling.
His book, ''American Sniper: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History,'' is dedicated to Marc Lee and Ryan Job, two friends and fellow SEAL members who died in combat. Mr. Kyle has donated the book's proceeds to their families.
The shootings have stunned many of Mr. Kyle's friends in North Texas law enforcement. ''You kind of want to just break down and cry,'' said one friend, Clint Burgess, a Tarrant County constable. ''All the stuff that Chris went through in his life -- for this to happen to him, it's just really hard to fathom.''
Mr. Kyle and Mr. Littlefield lived less than a mile apart in Midlothian with their families. Mr. Littlefield's wife, Leanne, is an assistant principal at a middle school there.
The shooting range, at a resort called Rough Creek Lodge nearly two hours from Lancaster, was a familiar place to Mr. Kyle. After he retired from the military in 2009, he founded Craft International, a Dallas company that often used the range and provided training to people in the military and law enforcement and to civilians.
The authorities said that on Saturday at 3:15 p.m., the three men arrived at the lodge in Mr. Kyle's truck and went to the range. About 5 p.m., a hunting guide at the lodge found the bodies of Mr. Kyle and Mr. Littlefield and called 911. Mr. Routh took Mr. Kyle's truck and drove to the house of his sister, Laura Blevins, in Midlothian, according to the authorities and court documents.
The arrest affidavit, signed by an Erath County sheriff's investigator, stated that after Mr. Routh told Mrs. Blevins and her husband what he had done, they told him to turn himself in. Instead, Mr. Routh left in the truck, telling them he wanted to go to Oklahoma to avoid the Texas authorities. The couple called the police.
About 8 p.m., Mr. Kyle's truck was found at Mr. Routh's house in Lancaster. Mr. Routh left the house, got into the truck and tried to drive away, but was soon apprehended. A gun that investigators believe was used in the shooting was found at Mr. Routh's residence. He did not have a state-issued license to carry a concealed handgun.

In 2 Trailers, The Neighbors Nobody Wants

SOUTHAMPTON, N.Y. -- Two trailers in this wealthy beach town stand as testament to an increasingly intractable problem for localities across the country: where to let sex offenders live after prison.
The cramped trailers house convicted rapists, sexual predators and child abusers, about 40 sex offenders in all. They are stuck here in large part because Suffolk County, like many jurisdictions, has in recent years passed laws that bar convicted sex offenders from living near schools, day care centers and other places with children.
The restrictions are so sweeping that it can be difficult for the offenders to find housing, leaving many homeless, officials said.
Suffolk County, on Long Island, installed the trailers, after the authorities discovered that sex offenders had crowded into cheap motel rooms, sometimes down the hall from families with children. Around the country, similar clusters of offenders have been found in campgrounds, under highway overpasses and other isolated spots. 
The solution here was supposed to be temporary.
That was nearly six years ago.
Today, the number of men living in the trailers in Southampton has doubled. And no one -- from local officials to victims' rights advocates to sexual abuse experts -- seems satisfied with the situation. Even staunch supporters of the rules are now questioning them.
''When you propose a law restricting sex offenders to 1,000 feet from any bus stop, that's just not going to work,'' said Laura A. Ahearn, executive director of Parents for Megan's Law and the Crime Victims Center, who lives on Long Island. ''You have to be reasonable.''
Others said they were concerned that sex offenders would not be able to rehabilitate themselves if they lived together in close quarters with large numbers of other offenders.
By law, convicted sex offenders in Suffolk County must have a permanent registered address there while on parole or probation. If they do not, they can be arrested again.
After they finish parole or probation, they can move away -- though they would be subject to the sex offender registration rules wherever they reside.
The men are not forced to live in the trailers, but typically end up in them because they have nowhere else to stay and fear being arrested if they are homeless.
Suffolk officials have tried to keep the trailers away from population centers. But one is in Southampton within walking distance of a retirement community, and residents there said they were worried about harm to property values and threats to visiting grandchildren.
The other trailer is in the parking lot of a prison. A bus service financed by the county transports the men between the trailers and pickup points, including train stations, in Suffolk.
County Executive Steve Bellone, a Democrat, had vowed to remove the trailers by Jan. 1, but missed the deadline.
Mr. Bellone has said he would work with the Suffolk police, which unveiled a plan last week for dealing with the county's more than 1,000 convicted sex offenders that officials called ''the toughest monitoring, verification and enforcement program in the nation.''
Under the plan, which must be approved by the County Legislature, the trailers would be removed and the sex offenders placed in homeless shelters around the county.
But similar proposals in recent years have foundered, and residents said they were wary of more promises.
''We've had these trailers for a long time, and it's time for the trailers to go,'' said Stephanie Canali, a resident of the retirement community who was one of about 65 people to attend a town-hall-style meeting last month on the issue.
In New York State, laws prohibit sex offenders on parole or whose victims were younger than 18 from residing within 1,000 feet of schools or other child care facilities. In 2006, Suffolk passed a law extending the distance for all sex offenders to a quarter mile. Southampton later stretched that to up to a mile. New York City has no residency restrictions beyond those required by the state.
New York State's law, like those of many states, was prompted by the 1994 killing of Megan Kanka, 7, in New Jersey by a neighbor who was a convicted sex offender.
The so-called Megan's Laws that were passed require sex offenders to register with local authorities and made way for residency restrictions.
Opponents of the restrictions say they offer only a semblance of protection. Not all sex offenders abuse children, for one, and those who do most often know their victims well before the abuse occurs, according to numerous studies.
The rules do not restrict the movements of sex offenders. The men in the Southampton trailers, whose convictions include child rape and disseminating pornography among minors, are required to sleep there at night. In the morning they must leave and check in with parole officers and social workers, but are otherwise free to go where they please.
An exception is Halloween, when, according to county law, registered sex offenders on parole or probation must remain indoors all day.
It is often difficult for convicted sex offenders to find a home that is legal. Landlords can be hesitant to rent to them. And neighbors can be hostile.
Without stable housing after prison, sex offenders can be hard to monitor and are more likely to lapse again into predation, said Bill O'Leary, a forensic therapist who works with victims and perpetrators of sexual and violent crimes in the New York area.
''This forces them to be more transient, which gives them more exposure to society,'' Mr. O'Leary said, referring to the residency restrictions. ''Even those that are the more predatory are forced to be out in society.''
For all the worries, no resident of the trailers has ever been arrested again on a sexual offense, officials said. But that does not bring much comfort to neighbors.
''There's outrage; these communities feel dumped upon,'' said Jay Schneiderman, a county legislator who represents Southampton.
He said he favored strong restrictions for sex offenders, but wanted other parts of the county to share some of the burden of housing them, perhaps by splitting the offenders in smaller groups in homes.
But he said he wondered whether anyone would willingly accept them.
''You have guys who have a real history of violence living in these trailers,'' he said.
In interviews, the men in the trailers complained that they lived in a kind of purgatory -- not behind bars, but not entirely free. They have already served prison terms for their crimes, and most are on parole or on probation.
The two trailers have a refrigerator, a microwave and rows of bunk beds. There were no showers until 2010, when a judge ruled this impermissible. Now one trailer has a shower that all 40 men share -- the offenders in the other trailer take the bus there to bathe a couple of times a week. Guards from a private firm are assigned to oversee the men.
''It's riddled with bedbugs, it's freezing, your clothes are wet,'' said Duane Moore, 53, a convicted rapist who spent a month in the trailers. ''Guys were playing with knives, and I've got to worry about guys slitting my throat for sitting on their bunk.''
Mr. Moore, who served 20 years in prison, was evicted from his first home, which he owns, after Suffolk passed its housing law.
He bought another and received approval from his parole officer and the local police before moving in with his wife and child. But the authorities overlooked a private day care center that was operating next door and a playground up the road. Mr. Moore, who graduated college in prison and now works as an information technology specialist, was evicted again.
''No one wants to live next to a sex offender,'' he said.
Courts in New York are now hearing several challenges to local housing laws, including those in Suffolk and neighboring Nassau County. Troy C. Wallace, a convicted rapist who lives in one of the trailers, recently filed another challenge in federal court.
Mr. Wallace, 42, was convicted of the sexual abuse of a 15-year-old in 1992. He served six months in prison after a plea deal, and spent the next decade and a half in and out of prison for parole violations and a burglary conviction.
Now he is free on parole and studying to become a paralegal. But because there is a day care near his home in Central Islip, he cannot live with his wife and daughter.
''A murderer can live wherever he wants. A shooter, a robber can live wherever he wants,'' Mr. Wallace said. ''I have to live in a trailer.''

Police Stops Are Down; So Is Murder

Last June, speaking at a church in Brooklyn, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said that the police had been cutting back on the number of people stopped, questioned and frisked.
This marked the official beginning of the end of the world in New York.
Crime was climbing, ''and it's almost certainly going to get worse,'' The New York Post declared in an editorial on June 21. Criminals were reading newspapers and they knew that the police were getting pressured about the stops: ''There's no denying the connection between rising crime and politically driven attempts to handcuff the N.Y.P.D. instead of the criminals.'' 
Over several days around the Fourth of July, there were bursts of violence in the city. ''How bad have things gotten?'' another Post editorial asked, going on to answer: In a seven-day period, there were 68 shootings, up more than 50 percent over the same week a year earlier. It blamed ''soft-on-thug'' measures like the easing of the Rockefeller drug laws, fewer police on the streets, and fewer stops and frisks.
''It's time to reform the reforms,'' the editorial concluded. ''More stop-and-frisk. Tougher drug laws.
''The alternative is more blood in the streets.''
Yikes.
As it turned out, though, there was an alternative they hadn't thought of. Between the end of March, when new police training was started, and the end of October, the number of stops did drastically decline -- a 28 percent decrease, to an average of 120,000 every three months in 2012 from about 166,000 for those same months in 2011. (The figures for the final quarter of 2012 are expected to be made public soon, officials say.)
And the streets ran with blood?
Actually, no.
New York in 2012 had the fewest recorded homicides in 50 years, 417, even with fewer police officers on the street and many fewer people being stopped and frisked.
It has been a matter of dogma that the stops helped drive down murder in New York, but the record in 2012 calls that presumption into serious question. Cutting the number of stops has not, so far, led to more killings.
That's not surprising: most of the weight of the stops falls on innocent people. Nearly 90 percent of those stopped had done nothing wrong. Most were African-American or Latino.
Facing criticism from a federal judge for the practices last March, the Police Department began retraining officers.
''We would hope that the additional training resulted in better stops, reinforcing that they be conducted appropriately and recognizing that, at a minimum, a stop is an inconvenience to the person being stopped,'' said Paul J. Browne, the spokesman for the Police Department.
The courts have made it clear that a police officer can stop a person, and if the officer has worries about safety, can conduct a superficial pat-down to check for weapons. For a more intrusive frisk, the courts require ''probable cause'' to believe that the person is carrying a weapon, not simply a hunch. The city's own records showed that the legal standards were not being met, the federal judge found.
Next month, more legal challenges on the stops will be heard in federal court in Manhattan. Among the plaintiffs are a teaching assistant who was searched on Walton Avenue in the Bronx while carrying a sandwich to school from a Subway shop, and a freelance video editor frisked as he walked to his home on Beach Avenue, also in the Bronx; finding no weapons or drugs, the editor said, an officer accused him of illegally using a driver's license from another state. The editor said he did not drive in New York.
The police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly, has challenged critics of the stop-and-frisk practice to suggest other approaches to getting illegal handguns out of the hands of criminals. Those, he said, are the kinds of weapons -- not assault-type weapons -- that cause the most havoc in New York.
One approach might be taken from football coaches, who review films of games to see what could be done better. With tiny lightweight video cameras that can be mounted on a hat, officers could record an encounter at little cost. These could be studied to improve tactics and compliance with the Constitution.
''How soon, I wonder, would we be criticized and then sued for having videos of persons stopped?'' Mr. Browne asked. A fair question. Still, it would be just one more lawsuit. And it's one worth fighting.

Top Judge Says Bail in New York Isn't Safe or Fair

BYLINE: By RUSS BUETTNER

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 1017 words

Castigating the bail process in New York as unfair to the poor and susceptible to allowing dangerous suspects to be set free, the state's top judge called on Tuesday for an overhaul of the bail system that would bring the state closer in line with the rest of the country.
In his annual State of the Judiciary speech in Albany, the chief judge, Jonathan Lippman, said New York was one of only four states that did not allow judges to consider public safety when making a bail determination. The main criteria used by judges is the risk of the defendant's not returning to court for trial. 
''As a result, defendants may be put back on the street with insufficient regard to public safety, with possibly catastrophic consequences,'' he said. ''Few, if any, would seriously argue that judges should not consider the safety and well-being of people on our streets or in our homes when making bail decisions.
''This makes no sense and certainly does not serve the best interests of our communities and our citizens.''
Conversely, Judge Lippman said the bail system was stacked against those accused of minor crimes, keeping them in jail at great personal hardship and weakening their resolve in plea negotiations. The judge called that outcome ''unfair'' and said it ''strips our justice system of its credibility.''
It will take some time to see how Albany lawmakers will react to those proposals. The judge's past ideas have gained political traction: last year, a law was passed that drew on the recommendations of a task force he created to expand the state's DNA databank and to ensure defendants' access to DNA tests.
Most jurisdictions in the country use rigid schedules that set bail or bond amounts based on the crimes charged, said Timothy J. Murray, executive director of the Pretrial Justice Institute in Washington.
Judge Lippman's proposal is in line with trends across the country to overhaul bail so that it is based more on an analysis of the risk that defendants pose to public safety, rather than their financial well-being. The United States Conference of Chief Justices, of which Judge Lippman is a member, last week adopted a resolution with similar goals.
''There's clearly a national movement, which has examined our traditional bail practices and has, across the board called, for rational, safe and effective reform,'' Mr. Murray said.
There is no way to quantify the precise number of cases where an inappropriately low bail was set for a violent suspect in New York. But those situations -- especially if the freed suspect commits another crime while free on bail -- are often seized upon by politicians and the news media seeking examples of so-called junk justice.
In 2011, for example, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg criticized a Brooklyn Criminal Court judge for releasing a suspect in a drug case without bail, even though there was a warrant for his arrest for a shooting in North Carolina. A month later, the suspect, Lamont Pride, was arrested and charged with the fatal shooting of a police officer.
''It's not a lot of work to do to protect the public,'' Mr. Bloomberg said at the time. ''It was not done, plain and simple.''
In the city, only 44 percent of defendants offered bail are released before their case concludes, said Jerome E. McElroy, the executive director of the New York City Criminal Justice Agency.
There have been studies on bail conditions for those arrested over low-level crimes.
A report by Human Rights Watch found that there were 19,137 nonfelony defendants arrested in the city who had bail set at $1,000 or less. The report found that 87 percent of the defendants in those cases did not post bail and went to jail to await trial. They remained for an average of 15.7 days.
Carol Brown, 54, was arrested in East New York, Brooklyn, on Jan. 24, when a local police officer said he saw her drop a crack pipe. She said she was innocent, but when a judge set her bail at $1,000, she knew she had no chance to make it.
Ms. Brown was held for 12 days, including eight days on Rikers Island after her bail was reduced to $250, before the case was dropped because a lab test showed there was no drug residue on the pipe, her lawyer, Cory Mescon, said.
''I'm a human being, and I should be treated as so,'' Ms. Brown said in a phone interview on Tuesday. ''It doesn't matter if I didn't have a job. It's the point that eight days of my life is unaccounted for, and for nothing.''
One of the underlying principles of the system in New York is that bail should not reflexively reflect a presumption of guilt in a serious crime. But critics of the state's bail mechanism have long said that for poor defendants, it frequently serves as a de facto sentence before trial.
''The bail system in New York is frankly an embarrassment,'' said Steven Banks, chief lawyer for the Legal Aid Society. ''It's essentially sentence first, disposition second.''
Judge Lippman was harshly critical of the outsize role he said bail-bond businesses had taken in the process. The judge said bondsmen, who essentially ensure defendants will return to court for a fee and access to collateral, had typically ignored defendants held on low bail amounts because their fees were based on a percentage.
In recent years, the use of bail bonds and pretrial release rates have fallen, he said.
Judge Lippman suggested taking ''the profit motive'' out of bail bonding by encouraging more involvement of nonprofit organizations, something that was enabled by state legislation that passed last year and that the judge said had been a success in the Bronx.
He also called for the expansion of supervised release programs that monitor defendants awaiting trial and provide them access to social services, like programs to help overcome drug and alcohol abuse. He noted that pretrial detention cost an average of $19,000 per defendant nationally, whereas monitoring a defendant in the community cost less than $4,600.
''You do the math,'' the judge said. ''There is enormous potential savings if we can figure out how to safely and responsibly keep nonviolent defendants in the community while their cases are pending.''

Friends, Romans, Countrymen, All Brought to Life by Inmates

BYLINE: By MANOHLA DARGIS

LENGTH: 953 words

It's easy to imagine that the performers in ''Caesar Must Die,'' a riff on Shakespeare's ''Julius Caesar,'' are cut from coarser, more authentic material than that found in most productions. The movie, after all, is set in an Italian prison and cast almost entirely with real inmates. The prisoners' rough faces and darting eyes, the crooked arc of one man's nose and the unnervingly sly line of another's smile, suggest so much (murder most foul, to borrow a line), as do the occasional shivery biographical asides, particularly about the mafia, that jostle alongside the play's poetry. These men, surely, know about betrayal, vengeance and power, a knife in the gut and hands washed in blood. 
In truth, ''Caesar Must Die'' could easily be set in a Wall Street brokerage firm, a Hollywood talent agency or a Mexican drug cartel. As it is, the veteran directors and brothers Paolo and Vittorio Taviani shot the story in Rebibbia Prison, outside of Rome, and used male inmates and several former convicts to play all the roles. Working from their sharply abridged, Italian-language adaptation (Fabio Cavalli has a ''screenplay collaboration'' credit), the Tavianis open the movie in the play's final act with Brutus (an excellent Salvatore Striano) raising a sword in self-sacrifice. Brutus -- one of the play's villains and its supremely tragic figure -- will soon ask an aide to hold the sword so that he can run into it (assisted suicide being one prerogative of his station), an act that closes the circle opened by Caesar's murder.
The Tavianis, best known for films like ''Padre Padrone'' and ''The Night of the Shooting Stars,'' have their free way with Shakespeare, treating ''Julius Caesar'' more like a conceptual jumping-off point than like a sacrosanct text. Caesar's wife, Calpurnia, who memorably cries out in the night (''They murder Caesar!'') is missing, as is Brutus' wife, Portia, and assorted friends, senators and tribunes. The Senate is gone, and so too the Forum and the battlefield. What remains are men: scheming, agonizing, murdering men. There's an elemental, almost primitive quality to the Tavianis' condensing that, at its most effective, dovetails with the prison's severely circumscribed material reality, as if the high walls, barred windows and suffocating rooms were manifestations of the characters' states of mind.
Shortly after the movie opens, the story folds back in time to when the production began to take shape six months earlier. The most vivid preliminaries are the auditions, which take place in a room as unadorned as an undressed set. Two men, their backs to the camera, sit at the edges of the frame and address the inmates, who stand in the middle facing the camera (and us). Each inmate briefly introduces himself and his life and then acts, either with comic overstatement or startling intensity, the same nondescript scene. It's somewhat interesting to see these raw, presumably untutored actors throw themselves into their performances, though there's nothing surprising about the disclosure that some denizens of the criminal world have a talent for dissembling.
Much of ''Caesar Must Die'' is in black and white, a striking visual choice for a drama that, at least in its unabridged form, turns on characters who, from scene to scene, word to deed, are so complexly shaded. (It was shot in high-definition video that has such fine detail that you can play connect the dots with the actors' pores.) The Tavianis' movie is necessarily less involved (it runs 76 minutes) than Shakespeare's play, with most of their story given over to men rehearsing. Every so often, real life -- or rather the approximation being played on camera -- intrudes. Two prisoners bicker while rehearsing a scene, their private argument mirroring the dynamics in the drama. This insertion of nominal real life gives the movie a modest shiver, but such self-reflexivity feels more ritualistic than revelatory.
The inclusion of some backstage verisimilitude has its dividends, as in a brief, palpably lonely scene of an inmate making coffee in his cell. Again and again, though, the Tavianis seem to want you to infer something about the inmates from the lines they recite, as when Cassius (Cosimo Rega), while washing his hands in Caesar's blood, states that the assassins' scene will be repeated, a nod at past and future murders as well as at other less bloody performances. You can only guess what the lines mean to the inmates, who register as atmospheric blanks at best and brutal exotics at worst, even if the tale that they enact with such earnest vigor works because the original tragedy does. The play's the thing, to borrow another line, far more than the jailhouse setting is, which is this movie's great, unsurprising revelation.

Lines Form for Colorado Debate On New Laws to Regulate Guns

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

DENVER -- Democratic lawmakers in Colorado, a state haunted by two of the worst mass shootings in American history, unveiled a broad package of gun-control measures on Tuesday, but they stopped short of proposing a ban on assault rifles or any other types of firearms. 
Standing with a tearful tableau of family members whose relatives were killed at Columbine High School and an Aurora movie theater, both in Colorado, and Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., the lawmakers offered a preview of legislation that is likely to face fierce opposition from Republicans and skepticism from some rural Democrats in a state where hunting and sport shooting are pursuits that cross generations and partisan lines.
Colorado has emerged as a crucial stage for the battle over gun-control legislation. A national gun-control group has hired a lobbying firm here, and the president of the National Rifle Association is due to meet with Colorado's governor this week to make his case.
Under the Democrats' proposals, all private gun sales would be subject to background checks. Colorado now requires background checks at gun shows and retail stores, but not for private sales between individuals. The lawmakers also would limit ammunition clips to 10 rounds, banning the 30-round and 100-round magazines that a gunman used last summer in the shooting inside the Century 16 movie theater in Aurora.
And Democrats would make dealers and manufacturers of assault rifles liable for deaths or injuries caused by those guns, potentially stripping away some legal protections that have made gun makers immune from civil lawsuits brought by cities and family members of victims. That proposal could be trumped by a 2005 federal law that protects gun dealers and makers from civil actions.
Even with Democrats now in control of the governorship and both houses of the Legislature, supporters of the gun measures said a bruising political battle lay ahead. ''It will be a fight,'' said State Representative Rhonda Fields, a Democrat from Aurora whose son Javad was shot to death in 2005.
Rumblings of that fight showed themselves quickly at the news conference where the measures were announced. As lawmakers answered questions about whether farmers and ranchers who want to sell one another guns across a fence would have to submit to a background check (they would), Dudley Brown, a staunch gun-rights advocate, muttered, ''It'll make them felons.''
State Senator Greg Brophy, a Republican, listened from the back of the ornate Capitol chamber with quiet incredulity. He said universal background checks would be nearly impossible to enforce without requiring every gun in the state to be registered. And he said holding Glock or Bushmaster responsible for the actions of killers was akin to blaming Coors for drunken-driving accidents.
''They offer up a series of extreme measures that don't make people safer,'' he said, before acknowledging that Republicans probably did not have the votes to stop them. ''They're going to railroad the bills through. The question is, where's Governor Hickenlooper?''
Gov. John W. Hickenlooper, a first-term Democrat, has advocated background checks on all gun sales. But he has not endorsed more contentious measures like limiting ammunition magazines or imposing strict liability standards on gun makers.

Impregnated by Prisoner, Guard Now Faces Charges

BYLINE: By MOSI SECRET

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 19

LENGTH: 798 words

He was one of the most notorious criminals in New York's recent history, whose execution-style murder of two undercover police officers led a jury to issue the first federal death sentence in the city in more than a half century.
She was a lonely correction officer, assigned to guard the cell block at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where he was being held. 
Inside the federal jail, Ronell Wilson, the convicted killer, and Nancy Gonzalez, his nighttime guard, would talk for hours, according to other inmates. They would disappear together for minutes at a time, behind closed doors. Several times, they were seen kissing, confirming suspicions of an illicit romance.
Ms. Gonzalez later admitted that the two had sex repeatedly, with the goal of having a child together. She was aware, she said, of the many possible complications, from the prospect of facing jail herself to the difficulty of telling her child the truth about his father. She explained her motivations to another inmate: ''Why not give him a child, as far as giving him some kind of hope?''
On Tuesday, Ms. Gonzalez, 29, displaying the full contours of a pregnancy now in its eighth month, was arraigned in federal court on charges of sexual abuse of a person in custody, because an inmate cannot legally consent to sex. The charge carries a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison. She stood before the judge in a black overcoat and sweat pants, softly answering procedural questions while dabbing her eyes with a tissue.
The press surged around Ms. Gonzalez the instant she stepped out of the courthouse, and she put her head on the shoulder of her lawyer, Anthony L. Ricco. ''She's had a very tragic life and as this case proceeds, you'll learn more about it and how these affected her judgment,'' Mr. Ricco said. He added, ''People find love in the strangest places.''
The allegations added a scandalous new element to an already shocking case. In March 2003, Mr. Wilson climbed into the back seat of a car on Staten Island. In front were two undercover detectives, James V. Nemorin and Rodney J. Andrews, who were running a gun operation. He shot both men in the back of the head.
During the subsequent trial Mr. Wilson, who does not have any other children, wrote a letter to another inmate suggesting that his potential death sentence had provoked concerns in him about his legacy: ''I just need a baby before thiz pigz try to take my life. I need to have something behinde.''
After the death sentence was read, Mr. Wilson, who had seemed mentally disturbed at times, stuck out his tongue at the families of the victims.
Years later, a court of appeals overturned the death sentence, but not the conviction, ruling that a prosecutor had gone too far in vilifying Mr. Wilson before the jurors. He is awaiting a ruling from the judge overseeing the case to determine whether the government can continue to seek the death penalty, or whether he will face life in prison. Lawyers for Mr. Wilson contend that his I.Q. is so low that he is not subject to capital punishment.
The affair between Ms. Gonzalez and Mr. Wilson began last March and continued until August, when he was moved to solitary confinement without explanation, according to court documents.
A special agent with the Justice Department's Office of the Inspector General, Omar Daza, began the investigation after inmates at the Metropolitan Detention Center said they had observed Ms. Gonzalez and another inmate ''hugging and kissing,'' according to court papers. Another inmate reported that he saw Ms. Gonzalez in Mr. Wilson's cell, standing in front of him while his pants were pulled down and his genitals were exposed. Some of the claims were supported by recordings from jail security cameras.
The case is being prosecuted by the office of the United States attorney for the Eastern District, Loretta E. Lynch.
The affair, which was described by Ms. Gonzalez in several recorded telephone calls, began because Ms. Gonzalez was ''kind of sucked into his world.''
''I took a chance because I was so vulnerable and wanted to be loved and now I am carrying his child,'' Ms. Gonzalez said in one of the calls. She was speaking to another inmate she had met inside the jail, and with whom she had continued a romantic relationship after he was transferred to another prison. (The second inmate, who was not identified, offered to raise the baby as his own when he was released.) Months later, when Ms. Gonzalez learned she was being investigated, she lamented ever having become involved with Mr. Wilson.
''I know what is going to be said about me. I know that for me as a parent, how am I going to explain this to this little boy? 'Mommy was in the military, Mommy was a C.O.,' '' she said, ''And then the opposite end is with a person who took lives.''

Court Orders Names Redacted in Gun Database

BYLINE: By RUSS BUETTNER

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 20

LENGTH: 319 words

A New York State appellate court ruled Tuesday that the home addresses of gun-permit holders and hate-crime victims must be redacted from databases released under the state's Freedom of Information Law. 
The case stemmed from several requests for data that The New York Times filed in 2010 with the New York Police Department. The city denied the requests, but in November 2011, a lower court directed the department to provide the data with the addresses.
The decision by the First Department of the Appellate Division, a midlevel appeals court, reversed the lower court's decision and held that privacy concerns were legitimate grounds to deny the request.
Michael A. Cardozo, head of the city's Law Department, said the appellate panel of four judges reached ''the correct conclusion.''
''The ruling protects important privacy interests and allows an appropriate balance between privacy and safety concerns versus the public's right to know,'' Mr. Cardozo said.
A lawyer for The Times said the paper was reviewing the decision and considering its next steps.
In December, The Journal News of Westchester County published the names and addresses of thousands of gun-permit holders, a decision that drew a large number of complaints and some threats. The newspaper eventually removed the information from its Web site.
Such data can be used for other research, including eliminating cases of mistaken identity and matching the information with other publicly available material.
The state gun law passed last month also restricts access to previously public information about gun permits. The law requires that for its first 120 days, no information about gun-permit holders in a new statewide gun-registration database be made available publicly.
In the same decision, the appellate court ordered the lower court to reconsider its decision denying The Times access to a database related to the police's stop-and-frisk program.

Dutch Serve Up a Straight-Shooting Version of 'Guillaume Tell'

BYLINE: By GEORGE LOOMIS

SECTION: Section ; Column 0; The Arts/Cultural Desk; OPERA REVIEW; Pg. 

LENGTH: 1154 words

AMSTERDAM -- Cultural institutions in the Netherlands are reeling from cuts in funding by the national government, yet the Netherlands Opera perseveres apparently undaunted in presenting imaginative repertoire absorbingly staged. It opened the season with Franz Schreker's Expressionistic thriller, ''Der Schatzgrהber,'' and shortly thereafter presented George Benjamin's gripping new opera, ''Written on Skin.'' Last week it turned to a masterpiece of the 19th century with an uplifting new production of Rossini's final opera, ''Guillaume Tell'' (William Tell).
Following Covent Garden's recent staging in London of Meyerbeer's ''Robert le Diable,'' the new ''Guillaume Tell'' may reflect an upturn in the fortunes of French grand operas, those sumptuous, lengthy spectacles that so captivated Parisian audiences. Unlike Meyerbeer's operas, whose critical estimation sank after attacks by Wagner, the high reputation of ''Guillaume Tell,'' which was first performed at the Paris Opera in 1829, has been sustained by commentators perpetuating the glowing assessments by Berlioz and others. Yet that has not translated into regular opportunities to see this demanding work. 
Covent Garden's flippant production of ''Robert le Diable'' missed an opportunity to reveal why this murky tale of chivalric lore and supernatural happenings initially won such overwhelming popularity. ''Guillaume Tell,'' based on Schiller's drama, poses no such problem, for in straightforwardly relating the 13th-century struggle by the Swiss against their Austrian oppressors, its virtues are palpable. A panoply of tableaux rich in local color and vivid confrontations brims with music that is unmistakably Rossinian yet notably different in character from that of his comedies. The difference between the effervescent overture of ''The Barber of Seville'' and the expansive programmatic one here is symptomatic of the operas as a whole.
Still, the temptation to mock the lofty grandeur of ''Guillaume Tell'' will be perversely felt by some, as was demonstrated two seasons ago by a self-conscious production at, of all places, the Zurich Opera House. Fortunately, the production here by Pierre Audi, the Netherlands Opera's artistic director, shows unflinching trust in the opera, right down to the moment in Act 3 when an arrow from Tell's crossbow strikes the apple perched on his son's head.
George Tsypin's sets, lighted by Jean Kalman as if to suggest that fog from Lake Lucerne has cast a gloom over the action, neatly depict the craggy shore but also have strikingly surreal aspects, especially in Act 2 when boulders, tree branches and even an upside-down cow float in the air. Less handsome are three mobile turrets of plywood, though their height lends an imposing dimension to the Act 3 clash between the Swiss and Austrians, a scene that here reveals similarities to Verdi's auto-da-fי in ''Don Carlos,'' not least when (in Kim Brandstrup's choreography) ominous figures with whips compel the Swiss to participate in ''merrymaking.'' Yellow bands of sunlight break through overcast skies as the Swiss proclaim their newfound liberty in the opera's moving finale.
The splendid bass Nicola Alaimo, sounding like a young Gabriel Bacquier with added reserves of power, gives a heroic portrayal of Tell. John Osborn brings a ringing tenor to Arnold, the young Swiss whose patriotism is initially compromised by his love for the Hapsburg princess Mathilde. After nailing half a dozen high C's in his Act 4 aria, however, couldn't he have trusted Rossini and withheld an additional, unwritten one at the end? I've heard the entrance aria, ''Sombre forךt,'' sung more hauntingly, but otherwise Marina Rebeka's ravishing, resonant soprano is heard to arresting, often impassioned effect as Mathilde. The conductor Paolo Carignani does honor to the long score, which is sensibly cut so as to avoid damaging internal cuts in vocal numbers. ''Guillaume Tell'' is a co-production with the Metropolitan Opera, where it will be seen in a forthcoming season.
Meanwhile in Vienna, another Rossini opera -- this time a comedy and a work more frequently encountered -- enjoys a scintillating new staging at the Staatsoper. But the director Sven-Eric Bechtolf doesn't do ''La Cenerentola'' (the composer's Cinderella opera) a favor by emphasizing the arguably docile nature of Angelina, who bears the cruelty of her stepfather, Don Magnifico, and her stepsisters without complaint. Our first glance at Angelina, looking frumpy in a bland dress, makes for an amusing moment, especially after seeing her stunning-looking stepsisters. But she retains a certain plainness even after outfitted for the palace ball in a suitable gown (costumes by Marianne Glittenberg) and at the end persists in wearing glasses. True, the opera's alternate title is ''Goodness Triumphant,'' not ''Glamour Triumphant,'' but still.
Otherwise the production has many bright touches, including its 1950s setting in San Sogno, a fictional duchy somewhere near Italy whose national flag bears the Italian colors but also a lobster-and-sickle insignia. Scenes in the palace take place in the garage, where specimens from Prince Don Ramiro's sports car collection are proudly displayed (sets by Rolf Glittenberg). Mr. Bechtolf's direction is fluent and fast-paced, and it was clever the way he had singers freeze in apt positions during ensembles. The chorus consists of a motley collection of people from various walks of life, as if it included the entire population of San Sogno.
Vienna's Angelinas in recent decades have included Christa Ludwig and Agnes Baltsa, and the attractive young Irish mezzo Tara Erraught takes her place among them with a performance notable for poise, technical flair and lovely, well rounded tone, crowned by a glittering ''Non piש mesta.'' The tenor Dmitry Korchak supplies bright, flexible singing but a somewhat edgy sound as the dashing Don Ramiro, who spends much of the time disguised in the chauffeur's uniform of his valet, Dandini.
The experienced baritone Alessandro Corbelli offers his familiar animated portrayal of Don Magnifico, whose callousness toward Angelina reaches a low point when, pressed to explain the whereabouts of his third daughter, as listed in court records, he says she is dead. The bass Vito Priante, in nimble voice, is an amiable presence as Dandini, and the suave, resonant singing of Ildebrando D'Arcangelo, another bass, in the philosopher Alidoro's aria ''Lא del ciel nell'arcano profondo,'' as he preps Angelina for the ball, is a high point. The excellent stepsisters, Valentina Nafornita and Margarita Gritskova, contribute singing as fine as their looks. The veteran conductor Jesתs Lףpez-Cobos supplies zesty, authoritative leadership in an opera even richer in ensembles than ''The Barber of Seville.''
Guillaume Tell. Netherlands Opera, Amsterdam. Through Feb. 18.
La Cenerentola. Staatsoper, Vienna. Through Feb. 14.

A Partnership Seeks to Transform Kent State and Kent

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

SECTION: Section B; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; SQUARE FEET; Pg. 9

LENGTH: 1134 words

KENT, Ohio -- Though it is home to the second largest campus in Ohio's state university system by enrollment, this small Cuyahoga River city spent much of the last four decades neglecting, if not deliberately retreating from, its history as a college town and its place in the annals of the Vietnam War era.
But a $110 million mixed-use development that is under construction at the city's center is remedying that.
The project -- a melding of more than 500,000 square feet of office, retail, residential and public spaces -- is unfolding across a four-block, four-acre section of downtown. City and university leaders said the development, the largest downtown construction project in Kent's 208-year history, will outfit the city with new destinations that suit contemporary lifestyles and spending patterns. 
The project will also shift the entertainment and business center a few blocks south from the city's aging core and closer to Kent State University.
The development is specifically intended to open a new economic era in Kent by helping to recruit and retain young professionals, as well as Kent State students, faculty and staff members.
But city and university leaders said in interviews that the tight collaboration among the city, the university and private developers is also helping heal the psychic wounds from a previous era that has hindered Kent's development.
On May 4, 1970, four students were shot and killed by Ohio National Guardsmen during a demonstration against the Vietnam War. Nine other students were wounded. The cultural and geographic gulf that opened that day widened in 1975 with the completion of Haymaker Parkway, a five-lane downtown bypass that literally cut off the campus from Kent's center.
Two men, Dave Ruller, Kent's city manager, and Lester A. Lefton, president of Kent State University -- outsiders when they arrived here within a year of each other in 2005 and 2006 -- are credited with galvanizing the community to redevelop downtown and draw the city and the university closer.
''When I came here seven years ago I was aware of the undercurrent around that event and the strained relationship between the city and the university,'' said Dr. Lefton, an experimental psychologist who was raised in Brookline, Mass. He has spent much of his career teaching in the South, and has played a central role in fostering and managing the downtown development.
When he took the reins of the university, Dr. Lefton said, he became just as interested in the economy and the condition of the city.
''Why isn't there a hotel here? Where is the conference center? We need to develop a much stronger economy,'' he said. ''We have 28,000 students and 3,000 faculty members here that spend money. We need to generate some new business in this community.''
Mr. Ruller, who was raised in Rochester and spent much of his career helping to manage small cities in Virginia and Tennessee, said it was not that Kent had forgotten about its downtown.
''At least as far back as the 1980s and about every five years afterward, the city prepared a development plan that proposed much of what we're doing now,'' he said. ''Preserve the good old buildings. Demolish the bad ones and rebuild. Lester and I realized that it was time to work together and act like the future mattered.''
''It took two guys from someplace else who didn't know any better,'' he said.
Not since the early 1980s had Kent, a slow-growing city of nearly 29,000 south of Cleveland, invited new construction downtown. The city had been content to have a slowly evolving mix of sedate shops and family restaurants that attracted a trickle of students and faculty from the university.
The new office, retail, entertainment and residential spaces under construction are seen here as essential ingredients in a civic formula for attracting students and educated professionals, defining spending habits and rebranding Kent as a flourishing 21st-century college town.
The project's red brick buildings use traditional designs to meet modern retail, office and entertainment demands. They will define the boundaries of a new neighborhood that includes public spaces joined to alleys lined with inviting shops and restaurants.
The new construction will include facilities for the university, mixed-use structures that combine retail and office space, and infrastructure, including a $26 million transit center and parking structure. The transit center, financed in part with a $20 million federal grant, will house a bus station and a 300-space garage.
A $16 million, 80,000-square-foot, 94-room Kent State University Hotel and Conference Center is scheduled to open in June and will be owned and managed by the university's foundation. In addition, the university is set to start construction in spring 2014 on a 122,000-square-foot, $40 million building to house its College of Architecture and Environmental Design.
As for commercial space, two three-story office buildings opened last year on Water Street. Costing $20 million to build, they house two of the city's most prominent private employers -- the Davey Resource Group and Ametek -- and an assortment of restaurants and boutiques on the ground floors.
Two other, similar buildings, Acorn Alley I, which opened in 2009, and Acorn Alley II, which opened two years later, cost $18 million. They surround a public square and are linked by an alley of shops and restaurants.
Acorn Corner, a $4 million restoration of the former Kent Hotel, will house a ground-floor restaurant and offices on the upper three floors when it opens in the spring. Also scheduled to open in the spring is a $3.6 million esplanade that unfolds from an arch that faces Haymaker Parkway and the entrance to the hotel and conference center across the street.
Fairmount Properties, the Cleveland-based developer that opened the two office buildings on Water Street, will start construction this spring on a $6.5 million, five-story, 42,000-square-foot mixed-use retail and residential project across Depeyster Street from the new university hotel.
The project includes a restaurant on the ground floor, and 32 one- and two-bedroom market rate rental apartments on the upper floors. Rents will be $975 to $1,400 a month, said Adam Branscomb, a project manager at Fairmount Properties.
''In the competitive world of higher education, colleges and universities can no longer count on their own amenities to attract students or faculty,'' said Randy Ruttenberg, founder and principal of Fairmount Properties, which has made a specialty of developing projects with universities. ''Their long-term success depends on the role the surrounding environment plays in serving the college experience. Students want retail and housing choices adjacent to campus. Downtowns are such important assets for retention and recruitment.''

Judge Says No Delay in Trayvon Martin Case

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 15

LENGTH: 547 words

MIAMI -- A judge on Tuesday rebuffed George Zimmerman's request for a five-month delay of his trial in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, saying it would begin as scheduled on June 10.
''We are four months away from a trial date,'' Judge Debra S. Nelson of Circuit Court told defense lawyers during a contentious hearing. ''I don't see any of your issues to be insurmountable.''
The decision came on what would have been Mr. Martin's 18th birthday, which was commemorated outside the courthouse in Sanford, Fla., with community leaders and students singing ''Happy Birthday.'' The brief ceremony was just one in a series of events planned to honor Mr. Martin this week, including a community peace walk and a fund-raising event with the Martin family and the Rev. Al Sharpton. 
Acknowledging Mr. Martin's birthday at the start of the hearing, Mark O'Mara, Mr. Zimmerman's lawyer, said that ''the family has a special burden to bear today'' and that ''no matter what, a tragedy occurred.''
Mr. O'Mara said he requested a postponement of the trial because he needed more time to prepare, and he accused prosecutors of moving slowly in making evidence and witnesses available.
''We are working hard,'' Mr. O'Mara said. ''We are running into an enormous amount of resistance.''
Bernie de la Rionda, the lead prosecutor in the case, disputed that characterization in court on Tuesday, saying the delays were due in part to Mr. O'Mara often canceling depositions at the last moment.
''That's frustrating,'' he said.
Mr. Martin died nearly a year ago, on Feb. 26, while walking in a modest gated community in Sanford where Mr. Zimmerman served as a volunteer neighborhood watchman. Mr. Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, viewed Mr. Martin, who was black, as suspicious because of a string of recent break-ins. Mr. Zimmerman told the police that he fired his gun at Mr. Martin only after Mr. Martin attacked him. Mr. Martin, a Miami teenager, was unarmed.
The case cast a light on Florida's ambiguous self-defense law, Stand Your Ground, which allows people fearing great harm to retaliate with deadly force and is the core of Mr. Zimmerman's defense. The case provoked protests around the country over racial profiling and over the initial delay in arresting and charging Mr. Zimmerman.
In court, the two sides sparred over the yet-to-be scheduled deposition of so-called Witness 8, a teenage girl who was on the phone with Mr. Martin moments before his confrontation with Mr. Zimmerman. The girl spoke with Benjamin L. Crump, the lawyer for the Martin family, last March about her conversation with Mr. Martin, saying he told her that he was being followed and that he was scared. A scuffle appeared to have broken out, she said, and the line went dead.
Few details are known about the girl, but she is expected to be an important witness in the case.
In an affidavit submitted on Tuesday, Mr. Crump said that he found Witness 8 through Mr. Martin's cellphone records and that he interviewed her over a speakerphone because her family did not want her interviewed in person. At that time, Mr. Crump said he did not know her last name or her address in Miami. Mr. Martin's family and a reporter for ABC News were in the room with Mr. Crump during the conversation. Mr. Crump said he recorded the interview.

Bipartisan House Plan Focuses on Gun Trafficking

WASHINGTON -- Members of both parties in the House outlined a plan on Tuesday to stiffen penalties on the illegal purchase and transportation of guns, a rare show of agreement on an issue where bipartisanship has been scarce.
Two Democrats and two Republicans in the House of Representatives have introduced legislation that would create a dedicated federal anti-gun-trafficking law while further cracking down on people who buy firearms for someone else and lie about it on federal background check forms.
As the law is written now, ''the penalties are so weak it's like a slap on the hand,'' said one of the bill's sponsors, Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of New York. 
Their proposal closely mirrors one already introduced in the Senate. That bill has bipartisan support as well, a fact that has heartened gun-control supporters on Capitol Hill.
But even with new signs of greater bipartisan open-mindedness on gun control -- the House majority leader, Representative Eric Cantor, Republican of Virginia, signaled support on Tuesday for a stronger background check system -- lawmakers acknowledged the hurdles they face in getting any bill through both houses of Congress.
''For those who have deep concerns about the overreach of the federal government, I'm in that group,'' Representative Scott Rigell of Virginia, a Republican sponsor of the measure, said as he tried to assuage concerns of those in Congress and across the country who are worried about a federal push to limit the right to bear arms.
''To the extent that people slow down and take a look at it, read it -- unless you're a gun trafficker, unless you're a person who's a straw purchaser, there's really no problem with this,'' Mr. Rigell said.
The debate over gun-control legislation has never broken down cleanly along partisan lines. And this pattern is especially evident now as a number of Senate Democrats from states like Alaska, Colorado, Montana and West Virginia face tough questions from constituents back home.
But the unveiling of the House legislation on Tuesday showed the flip side of that dynamic. There are many House Republicans who represent affluent suburban areas where voters view gun control in less absolute terms and are generally more open to stricter laws. This includes Mr. Rigell, who represents an area around Virginia Beach, and Representative Patrick Meehan of Pennsylvania, another sponsor of the bill, whose district includes the north and west suburbs of Philadelphia.
Mr. Meehan, who was on hand for the announcement on Tuesday, said he planned to begin reaching out to other Republicans soon. ''We will begin the process of lining up the support of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle,'' he said.
Representative Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, lost his 20-year-old nephew to gun violence in 2011 and is another sponsor of the anti-trafficking bill. When he spoke on Tuesday in support of it, he said Americans grieving everywhere were calling on Congress to act. ''They are begging us to address this problem,'' he said.
The companion bill in the Senate is being sponsored by Senators Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, and Mark Steven Kirk, Republican of Illinois. Though it differs in some central ways from the House bill, it also would create a federal gun trafficking statute and strengthen penalties for lying on federal background check forms.
That bill is competing with a number of other gun control measures in the Senate, including another one focused on curbing trafficking. Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a Vermont Democrat and the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has a bill that would create a federal gun trafficking statute. But unlike the others, Mr. Leahy's focuses more on the buyer of the guns rather than the seller. He does not yet have a Republican co-sponsor.
Then there is the effort by Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, to ban the sale and manufacture of 157 types of semiautomatic weapons, as well as magazines holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition. And a group including Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, is preparing legislation that would allow for a more stringent system of background checks for firearms buyers.
Much of the agreement between Democrats and Republicans on gun control has been around strengthening background checks, and that has appeared to be the most likely prospect for approval early this year.
But anti-trafficking laws enjoy broad support from law enforcement agencies because they would help tackle a huge problem for police forces in major cities. Because of the country's patchwork gun laws, trafficking has enabled the spread of guns from places where firearm restrictions are relatively few, like in the South, to places where they are stricter, like New York City and California.
President Obama, speaking before an array of law enforcement officials in Minneapolis on Monday, stressed the importance of such laws.

Hip-Hop Speaks To the Guns

BYLINE: By TA-NEHISI COATES.

The work of the rapper Kendrick Lamar should enjoy heavy rotation in the White House these days. In this time of Tucson, Aurora, Colo., and Newtown, Conn., Lamar's major-label debut album, ''good kid, m.A.A.d city,'' gives us a broad reckoning with the meaning of everyday gun violence unfolding far from the tragic spectacle. ''Good Kid'' has earned its share of praise from critics and hip-hop fans, but it perhaps has the most to offer to those shocked into action by the senseless massacres we've endured over the past few years.
This particular moment has shined a light on a gun lobby that argues for maximum firepower and minimum responsibility. If history is any judge the moment will pass, and most of us will find ourselves again lost in our daily and particular business. When that time comes, there will be others of us who live in places where senseless shootings remain a corrosive constant. 
Lamar's album begins in such a place and tells the story of a teenage boy pursuing a girl with a mix of affection and lust. The character's ordinary ambition differs little from that of teenagers who once piled into their parents' car and turned the drive-in into a bacchanal. But Lamar's lover's lane runs through gang-infested Compton, Calif., and the make-out point is a deathtrap.
Hip-hop originates in communities where such hazards are taken as given. Rappers generally depict themselves as masters, not victims, of the attending violence. Their music is not so much interested in exalting to our preferred values as constructing a fantasy wherein the author has total control and is utterly invulnerable.
When your life is besieged, the music is therapy, vicarious mastery in a world where you control virtually nothing, least of all the fate of your body. I had a friend in middle school who would play Rakim every morning because he knew there was a good chance that he would be jumped en route to or from school by the various crews that roamed the area. But, in his mind, the mask of rap machismo made him too many for them.
''Good Kid'' is narrative told from behind the mask. Fantasies of rage and lust are present, but fear pervades Lamar's world. He pitches himself not as ''Compton's Most Wanted'' but as ''Compton's Human Sacrifice.'' He loves the city, even as he acknowledges that the city is trying to kill him. ''If Pirus and Crips all got along,'' he says, ''They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song.''
On one of the most affecting songs, ''The Art of Peer Pressure,'' he engages in a series of criminal escapades. It's reminiscent of N.W.A.'s ''Gangsta, Gangsta,'' except that Lamar is not a supercriminal but a boy out to impress his friends. The character's drug use is not so much a choice of pleasure as it is a puerile bid for attention: ''Look at me,'' he raps. ''I got the blunt in my mouth.''
I must confess my bias. I grew up in Baltimore during a time when the city was in the thrall of crack and Saturday night specials. I've spent most of my life in neighborhoods suffering their disproportionate share of gun violence. In each of these places it was not simply the deaths that have stood out to me, but the way that death corrupted the most ordinary of rituals. On an average day in middle school, fully a third of my brain was obsessed with personal safety. I feared the block 10 times more than any pop quiz. My favorite show in those days was ''The Wonder Years.'' When Kevin Arnold went to visit his lost-found love Winnie Cooper, he simply hopped on his bike. In Baltimore, calling upon our Winnie Coopers meant gathering an entire crew. There was safety in numbers. Alone, we were targets.
The world I lived in, and the preserve of Lamar's album, was created not by mindless nature but by public policy. It is understandable that in the wake of great tragedy we'd want to take a second look at those policies. But in some corners of America great tragedy has bloomed into a world that does not simply raise the ranks of the dead but shrinks the world of the survivors. ''Good Kid'' shows us how gun violence extends out beyond the actual guns.
Here is an album that people grappling with policy desperately need to hear. It does what art does best in that it bids the monotony of numbers to sing.

A headline in some copies on Wednesday about a court ruling on the release of information under New York State's Freedom of Information Law misidentified the type of data that had to be redacted. As the article correctly noted, the ruling said that the home addresses of gun-permit holders and hate-crime victims must be redacted, not the people's names.

Haunted by War, Syrian Artists Put Raw Emotions on View

BYLINE: By NINA SIEGAL

Last Friday, a digital image of Gustav Klimt's iconic painting ''The Kiss'' superimposed on a bomb-ravaged wall in Syria went viral.
The Saatchi Gallery, in London, shared the picture on its Facebook page and within five hours it had received more than 21,000 Facebook ''Likes'' and was subsequently transmitted across the globe.
The striking image, ''Freedom Graffiti,'' by Tammam Hazzam, a Syrian artist, is part of his recent series, ''Syrian Museum,'' which merges iconic Western masterpieces by such painters as Leonardo da Vinci, Henri Matisse, Goya and Picasso, with recent photos of Syria's devastated cityscapes.
Mr. Hazzam said his intention was to draw a parallel between ''the greatest achievements of humanity with the destruction it is also capable of inflicting.'' 
''Each is particularly relevant to what has befallen Syria,'' he said. ''Klimt's 'The Kiss' shows the love and relationship between people, and I have juxtaposed this with the capacity of hate the regime holds for its people.''
Mr. Hazzam, who was born in Damascus, has been living in Dubai since he and his family fled Syria with the help of his gallery in September 2011, seven months after the start of the uprising there.
''When I lost my studio in Damascus and needed new ways to express myself and my sadness with the events that were unfolding in Syria, I began working with digital art,'' he said in an e-mail interview. ''It became my form of protest.''
Mr. Hazzam is one of about two dozen artists who have escaped Syria with the help of the Ayyam Gallery, a contemporary-art gallery devoted to emerging Middle Eastern talent.
Founded in Damascus in 2006 by two cousins, Khaled Samawi and Hisham Samawi, the gallery became a haven for Syrian artists and has now become a conduit for Syrian artists to express their responses to the devastation of their country.
Opening showrooms in Dubai and Beirut, Ayyam quickly expanded beyond Syria. This year, it opened its first Western location, in London, on Jan. 24, and it plans to inaugurate a fifth space in Jidda -- the first contemporary-art gallery in Saudi Arabia -- on Feb. 27.
The London location, on New Bond Street, was designed by Nadim Karam, a Lebanese architect and sculptor who is perhaps best known for his monumental public art works. He is also the subject of the first London exhibition, ''Shooting the Cloud,'' on show until March 9.
Mr. Karam, who grew up in Beirut, has his own opinions about how artists can respond to violence and war.
''We have to live the best we can, even during wars,'' Mr. Karam said in a telephone interview from Beirut. ''War is a factor that is there and will sometimes stop you, but as soon as it slows you have to move forward again, and that's when the creativity arises again. It's important to show the creative part of this region, an image that is different from what people think of, the terror and death.''
Mr. Karam says Ayyam represents not only his work but also his philosophy.
''When I feel that I have done a lot to push the limits, I feel that Ayyam has done the same,'' he said. ''That's why this London project is important. It's a different expression of what the Middle East can be. It's a platform for me to be able to show the playful, whimsical aspect of what's being created.''
Ayyam did not start out with ambitions to become a politically engaged art gallery, however.
Hisham Samawi, who was born in Syria and has an M.B.A. from Columbia University, said he was originally just looking for entrepreneurial opportunities in the booming Middle Eastern art market in 2006. Christie's had just opened its first salesroom in Dubai, attracting international buyers, and the gallery scene in the United Arab Emirates was becoming a hub for Middle Eastern contemporary art.
Mr. Samawi contacted his older cousin, Khaled, an avid art collector who had worked as a banker in Geneva and had ''retired'' to Syria, and asked if there might be anything to leverage in the contemporary art scene there.
Seeing no major contemporary galleries in Damascus, but many graduates of the Faculty of Fine Arts at Damascus University, they decided to try and cultivate a scene. They put out a call for entries to an art competition and received 150 submissions; from those, they selected 15 young artists to represent.
''Our first year was tremendous because Damascus was really starting to open up,'' Hisham Samawi recalled. ''It was almost having this rebirth and a lot of people were visiting -- there were a lot of boutique hotels popping up everywhere. They would hear about the gallery and come see us; they were coming to see the oldest city in the world and were just blown away by the contemporary art there. A lot of people were flying in and collecting our young artists. That was 2006.''
In 2008, they put out another call for talent in Dubai and opened a second gallery there; the next year, they opened their third gallery in Beirut. They were quickly developing a reputation as a go-to source of homegrown Middle Eastern talent. Their formula was a success, with works priced at $10,000 to $30,000 selling at a clip.
When the revolution in Syria began in 2011, however, they had to make changes.
''We had seen what happened in Tunisia and in Egypt,'' Mr. Samawi said. ''My partner was in Syria; the gallery's inventory and artworks were there, and the artists were there. We thought the chances were high that we'd have to move things out of Damascus. We started with our artists and employees.''
That meant helping about 8 employees and their families, plus about 25 artists and their families arrange visas, raise relocation funds and find new homes and studios in different countries so they could continue to work. They shipped 3,000 paintings from Damascus to Dubai and turned the Damascus gallery into a safe haven for the artists who, for one reason or another, could not leave Syria.
''We converted the gallery into a refuge for the artists to come be together and to continue working -- that was about two years ago,'' Mr. Samawi said. ''At that time, to keep them more connected to the rest of the world, we had Web cams doing live feeds of them working during the days.''
About five are still in Damascus, while the rest are in Dubai, Cairo or Beirut.
''Mentally they're still there even if they're living somewhere else,'' Mr. Samawi said. ''Now that they're out and their safety isn't in jeopardy, they feel a bigger need to express their thoughts and to respond to what's happening in Syria. If there's one thing that has come out of this terrible situation is the art that's coming out is extraordinary and the reaction that people all over the world are having to it.''
For his part, Mr. Hazzam, the Syrian artist, has vowed to realize his ''Freedom Graffiti'' as a real wall painting when he is finally able to go home.
''I have decided to bring this piece to life when I am able return to Syria,'' he said. ''There are over 10,000 walls now in Damascus with this bullet-ridden quality after the bombings of the regime.''
Mr. Hazzam said he was quite sure that he would be able to find one he could use.

1913 Bulgarian Forces Sweep Turks
CONSTANTINOPLE -- Heavy fighting has been in progress for the past two days in the Gallipoli peninsula, where the Bulgarians have won all along the line. The Turks, on their own admission, have lost 5,000 men. The Gallipoli combat began on February 4. The Bulgarians advanced from Kadikeui toward Kavak, which the Turks occupied. The fight lasted till evening. After nightfall, the Turks retired toward Bulair. Another Bulgarian detachment advanced on Myriophito, on the Marmara coast, and occupied it. The corvette Zouave shelled the enemy advancing in the direction of Charkeui. 
1938 Plane Lands in Hudson River
WEST POINT -- Hundreds of cadets and their girl friends were interrupted in the middle of the weekly Saturday [Feb. 7] night ''hop'' by the roar of a low-flying plane and then a resounding crash as it dived into the ice-caked Hudson River about a half-mile north of the United States Military Academy grounds. The dance was halted as cadets rushed for overcoats and flashlights. Later a powerboat manned by State Police found the remains of the plane, after first finding traces of oil in the water and smelling gasoline. The plane and the occupant were not identified.
1963 Emir Abd-el-Krim Dies at 81
CAIRO -- Emir Abd-el-Krim, 81, the famed Moroccan Riff chieftain who, according to legend, once escaped French imprisonment by hiding in his mother's coffin, died of a heart attack here today [Feb. 6]. Death came to the old mountain warrior a few months before he planned to return to Morocco after 37 years in exile. A Moroccan Embassy source said the body would be buried with in the Moroccan Riff, where he so successfully campaigned against Spanish troops in the 1920s. But the Spanish persuaded the French to fight and the combined force, led by Marshal Philippe Pיtain, moved against his rifle-armed soldiers with planes, artillery and machine guns. He was captured and exiled to Reunion Island, where he lived for 20 years with his two favorite wives, his three sons, a clutch of relatives and his servants.

Nets Win but Don't Look Very Sharp in Doing It

BYLINE: By ZACH HELFAND

LENGTH: 708 words

AUBURN HILLS, Mich. -- By the fourth quarter, Nets Coach P. J. Carlesimo's joke seemed prophetic. Speaking before the game Wednesday against the Detroit Pistons, Carlesimo mentioned his team's inability to put away lesser opponents.
In their previous meeting against the Pistons, Carlesimo said, the Nets had ''killed them at home by 1 or 2 in double overtime.'' 
On Wednesday, the Nets barely prevailed again. They had to shake off a quick turnaround after a loss to the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday night, sloppy play early and spotty shooting, but the Nets claimed a 93-90 victory behind strong bench play.
Greg Monroe led all scorers with 23 points, but he could not hit the tail end of two free throws with 33.6 seconds left and a chance to tie the score. On the next possession, Brook Lopez posted up Monroe and converted a layup to extend the Nets' lead to 3, which effectively sealed the victory. Will Bynum's desperation 3-point attempt at the buzzer fell short, and the Nets held on.
''There were things we did do well,'' Carlesimo said after the game. ''The fact that we hung in, the fact that we didn't turn the ball over and the fact that we executed down the stretch. I mean to find a way to win on the road is a good thing. You know, we're not there yet, but good teams find a way to win.''
Entering Wednesday, the Nets had lost four of their last six games, in what has become the roughest stretch of Carlesimo's short but productive tenure. But the game against the Pistons, as well as Friday's matchup against the struggling Washington Wizards, offered the opportunity to break through the malaise against teams the Nets usually feast upon. The Nets now own an 18-1 record playing against sub-.500 teams. But they do not always make it easy.
The Nets were content to play catch-up for much of the game Wednesday. At the start of the first two quarters, they gave the Pistons some slack, and in a late-period scoring fury, they reeled them back into striking range.
The Pistons used easy transition baskets off early turnovers to open a double-digit lead in the first quarter, before a late Nets run cut the lead to 1 point at the buzzer. Deron Williams had three turnovers early in the game, which led to Detroit scores. Williams finished with 12 points on 4-of-10 shooting and reached 5,000 career assists, though he mostly dismissed the milestone. ''I know I'm not catching John Stockton,'' he said with a smile.
Again, in the second quarter, Detroit led by as many as 13 points before allowing 7 unanswered points in the final 2 minutes 38 seconds of the half. The Pistons' lead held until the fourth quarter, when the Nets clawed back thanks to strong bench play from MarShon Brooks, Keith Bogans and Andray Blatche, who combined for 24 points.
Carlesimo said the bench salvaged the game ''twice, when the frontline guys weren't doing good and it looked like the game was going to get out of hand.''
Despite the win, the Nets' underlying problems remained. The shooting was spotty. Before the game, Carlesimo said that against the Lakers, it ''looked like there was a lid on the basket.'' The Nets missed the rim altogether on six shots Wednesday, including three air balls in a row by Mirza Teletovic. Teletovic laughed off the misses, but they almost crippled the Nets' fourth-quarter comeback.
The effort, too, was inconsistent. At times, they played sloppily, at other times, uninterested. During a timeout with 5 minutes 19 seconds remaining and the Nets leading just by just a point, several players on the bench grew distracted by a dancing usher on the scoreboard.
But when it counted, Lopez and his teammates responded with just enough. Lopez finished with 17 points and 9 rebounds on 8-of-14 shooting, including the layup in the waning seconds of the game. Joe Johnson said the play was disguised as a similar play designed for him, and it fooled the Nets bench.
''You never know who's going to take the last shot on this team,'' he said. ''I think that's the great thing about the setup that we have.''
The victory was enough to ease memories from the tough loss to the Lakers and a grueling travel day.
''It was kind of polar opposite tonight'' from the Lakers game, Lopez said. ''Tonight, we were great in the last three minutes.''

With Care, Newtown Tries to Move On Amid Tokens of Grief

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME

NEWTOWN, Conn. -- In the 1,500 or so cards and letters in Box 58 at the Newtown Municipal Center, a mother named Ursula recalled the 6-month-old she lost in an auto accident; a 9-year-old, Hayden Toland-Yeh, pondered mortality; and Robert M. Sutton, a lawyer from Myrtle Beach, S.C., wrote movingly about the gun violence that ravaged his family when he was 6.
''Where to begin? What to say?'' began the letter from the employees at American Builders and Nu World Graphics in Las Vegas.
''We live in a great country,'' Gail Porter of Bend, Ore., wrote, ''but this has brought all of us to our knees.'' 
''I have been praying for you nonstop for the past week,'' Makenna Hewitt wrote. ''I know we have never met, but I hope you understand what I mean when I say I think of you as friends.''
''I guess when you see one of your friends, you never know if it's the last time,'' Hayden concluded. ''So I have written you this letter because I want you to know I care.''
Almost two months after 26 children and educators were massacred at Sandy Hook Elementary School, local residents and officials are trying to figure out what to do with hundreds of thousands of letters, cards, posters, banners, photographs, paintings and quilts -- a time capsule of grief and a reminder that even here catastrophe cannot last forever.
They are trying to balance respect and practicality, the need to remember and the need to move on, the options presented by the digital world and the power of the tangible artifacts in pen and paper, crayon and paint, glitter and cotton balls, fabric and thread.
The current plan is to have volunteers photograph as many items as possible to create a digital archive. Families of those who died and others including Sandy Hook teachers and staff, then the rest of the Sandy Hook school community and then people in town, are allowed to take whatever they want as mementos. Virtually all of the remaining materials are scheduled to be removed beginning Feb. 19. Most are likely to be destroyed and perhaps ground into cement or building materials as part of a permanent memorial. Officials say they do not have the ability to permanently and properly store the letters.
''We don't have any experience with this,'' said Pat Llodra, the first selectman. ''I don't know that anyone does. So we're guided by our hearts in what feels right and by our brains in what we feel is possible.''
To enter Newtown's three-year-old Municipal Center on the campus of what was once a state mental institution is to enter a museum of grief, all the walls full of posters and banners, paintings and quilts, sent from Virginia Tech and Columbine and hundreds of communities around the world. Set up on tables are more than 300 boxes (with more elsewhere in town) containing hundreds of thousands, perhaps close to a half-million, cards and letters that visitors can pick through in meditative silence.
In a room at the rear of the hall, Steve Marlin, a retired pharmaceutical executive, was painstakingly going through Box 58, carefully laying out all the cards and letters and photographing them with a mounted Canon 60D. There was a four-leaf clover, a lucky quarter, a favorite cross. A $10 bill tumbled out of the card signed by MacKenzie Kowalczik, 8, and Ethan Kowalczik, 10. Children scrawled messages above crayoned angels; grandparents shared their own sorrows in a shaky hand; a writer remembered his childhood being bullied and ostracized.
Across the building, many came from children at places like the Lavelle School for the Blind in the Bronx or Oregon Episcopal School.
Surrounded by Christmas trees, angels ascending to heaven and hearts broken or shedding tears, they said: ''They'll always be with you.'' ''Everybody cares.'' ''I wish I could come down and give you a hug.'' ''I didn't know your child, but I still cried for him/her.'' ''No words.''
An inmate at the High Desert State Prison in California wrote that he heard about the killings on television, thought about his own 3 1/2-year-old daughter, and cried for those who died. He quoted Ezekiel 18:4 and concluded: ''So from one father, from parent to another, please accept my deepest love, respect and condolences to you all.''
Staff Sgt. Laurence Bennett, who said he was returning home after nine months in Iraq, sent the Connecticut flag that had hung in their dining hall in Iraq when it was attacked by insurgents in 2012, now signed by more than 400 military and civilian personnel from 10 countries.
A writer who identified herself as ''a grandma in Massachusetts'' said she had lost an infant, lost an adult child to mental illness and lost another loved one to a ''traumatic, horrific death,'' then gave her tips on recovery.
''It's a club that nobody wants to belong to. It changed how we see things, and we didn't get there overnight, but we're ok.''
One student extolled the virtues of catfish for making people happy. Nick Bay, 30, from Illinois, sent condolences and a picture of himself with his dog, Flash, who is outfitted in what looks like a frog costume. A high school wrestler named Luke wished Newtown well, noting, ''The entire nation, including the wrestling world, was taken back when we were informed.''
Inah Cecilio and her sixth-grade class at Lindbergh Elementary School in Palisades Park, N.J., said of the dead children: ''You will feel them around you. Close your eyes, and that wind blowing, that scent in the air, that is them letting you know not to be sad because they will forever be with you.''
More than anything there were invocations of religion and faith, Bible passages, references to God's grace. Sometimes there was even sympathy for the gunman who created so much grief. ''It's not a crime to be different or mentally challenged,'' wrote the man who spoke of being bullied and ostracized as a child. ''It should be a crime to ignore, reject, neglect and fail them.''
What happens next is not totally clear. Yolie Moreno, a local resident, is leading the team of volunteers hoping to photograph every item for a digital archive. Ross MacDonald, an illustrator in town, who has been photographing items for weeks, has created a Web site for some of them and is speaking with local library officials and casting a wider net to see if the originals can be preserved. He is working with Mother Jones magazine, which is helping with a Tumblr site.
It is all being improvised, but that has been Newtown's experience since Dec. 14. As one message in watercolor says: ''You don't know how strong you are until being strong is the only option you have.''

A Hospital Offers A Grisly Lesson On Gun Violence

BYLINE: By JON HURDLE

PHILADELPHIA -- In a darkened classroom, 15 eighth graders gasped as a photograph appeared on the screen in front of them. It showed a dead man whose jaw had been destroyed by a shotgun blast, leaving the lower half of his face a shapeless, bloody mess.
Next came a picture of the bullet-perforated legs of someone who had been shot with an AK-47 assault rifle, and then one of the bloated abdomen of a gunshot victim with internal injuries so grievous that the patient had to be fitted with a colostomy bag to replace intestines that can no longer function normally. 
These are among about 500 gunshot victims who are treated each year at Temple University Hospital, an institution in the heart of impoverished, crime-ridden North Philadelphia. While President Obama and Congressional leaders debate legislation intended to prevent mass killings like the elementary school shooting in Newtown, Conn., the hospital is trying to slow the rate of street killings by helping teenagers understand the realities of gun violence.
The unusual program, called Cradle to Grave, brings in youths from across Philadelphia in the hope that an unflinching look at the effects that guns have in their community will deter young people from reaching for a gun to settle personal scores, and will help them recognize that gun violence is not the glamorous business sometimes depicted in television shows and rap music.
The program is open to all schools in the city, but about two-thirds of the participants were referred by officials from the juvenile justice system. Children younger than 13 are not normally admitted. So far, about 7,000 teenagers have participated since it began in 2006, and despite the graphic content, no parent has ever complained, said Scott P. Charles, the hospital's trauma outreach coordinator.
''In seven and a half years, I have never had a parent say, 'I can't believe what you just showed my child,' '' Mr. Charles said.
On a recent day the eighth graders, students from nearby Kenderton School, gathered around Mr. Charles at the start of a two-hour visit. Most said they knew someone who had been shot.
''Our goal here isn't to scare you straight,'' Mr. Charles told them. ''We're just trying to give you an education.''
According to police statistics, 331 people were killed in the city in 2012, equaling the highest total since 2008, and the fourth consecutive year of increase. Eighty-six percent of them were killed by firearms, the police say.
Still, the number of killings in the city of about 1.5 million residents has dropped from a high of 406 in 2006, when national news media started calling the city Killadelphia.
In a 2010 paper published in the medical journal Injury, Dr. Amy J. Goldberg, the hospital's chief of trauma and surgical critical care, and others cited data showing that students' inclination toward violence decreased after participating in the Cradle to Grave program, especially among those classified as having an ''aggressive response to shame.''
''These results suggest that hospitals offer a unique opportunity to address the public health crisis posed by inner-city firearm violence,'' the study said.
The program starts with a visit to the hospital's trauma bay, the first stop for gunshot victims -- half of them under 25 -- who are brought to the hospital from North Philadelphia's streets at an average rate of more than one a day.
As the 13- and 14-year-olds gathered around a gurney on a recent visit, Mr. Charles told the story of Lamont Adams, 16, who died at the hospital after being shot 14 times by another boy who believed Lamont had snitched about a street dice game that was broken up by police officers.
Lamont arrived in the trauma bay with 24 gunshot wounds, 10 more than the 14 rounds that had been emptied into him, because some of the shots had also exited his body, in some cases leaving indentations in the sidewalk, Mr. Charles told the students.
In case his verbal description was not sufficiently vivid, Mr. Charles asked Justin Robinson, 13, to play the part of Lamont. The boy lay down on an empty body bag. Mr. Charles attached 24 circular red stickers to Justin's clothing to represent the wounds in Lamont's body.
Mr. Charles told the students that the wounds he finds most moving were those in the boy's hands. ''He holds up his hands and begs the boy to stop shooting,'' Mr. Charles said. ''He had not prepared himself for how terrible this would be.''
The narrative was then taken up by Dr. Goldberg, who told the children that by the time Lamont arrived in the trauma bay, he was not breathing, so surgeons -- without the use of anesthetics -- quickly inserted a breathing tube into his windpipe.
Neither did he have a pulse but that did not stop the doctors from inserting a tube into his groin to replace the blood he was losing, and then to open his chest in the hope of restarting his heart -- which turned out to have three or four holes in it, Dr. Goldberg said. She held up a stainless steel rib-spreader.
As the details of Lamont's story unfolded, one girl struggled to keep her composure. Another hid her face in her friend's shoulder. Lamont died about 15 minutes after arriving at the hospital, underscoring that prevention of gun violence is a lot better than trying to cure its effects, Dr. Goldberg concluded.
''Who do you think has the best chance of saving your life?'' she asked the students. ''You do.''
Despite the grisly images, most of the students said afterward that people should still be allowed to own guns for self-defense, although not assault weapons. Mahogany Johnson, 14, said she is in favor of a street ban on semiautomatic weapons like AK-47 assault rifles, which she said should be used ''only in the woods.'' Jabriel Steward, 14, said, ''Everybody should be allowed to have one gun for protection, for self-defense.''
But Feliciana Asada, 14, said more students should be given the opportunity to participate in Cradle to Grave. ''Programs like this need to be installed in schools,'' she said.

Clashes Erupt in Damascus as Prospects for Syrian Talks Dim

BYLINE: By HANIA MOURTADA and RICK GLADSTONE; Hania Mourtada reported from Beirut, and Rick Gladstone from New York. Hwaida Saad contributed reporting from Beirut; Hala Droubi from Dubai, United Arab Emirates; and Karam Shoumali from Antakya, Turkey.

BEIRUT, Lebanon -- Syrian insurgents attacked military checkpoints and other targets in parts of central Damascus on Wednesday, antigovernment activist groups reported, shattering a lull in the fighting as prospects for any talks between the antagonists appeared to dim.
The outbreak came a week after the opposition coalition's top political leader first proposed the surprise idea of a dialogue with President Bashar al-Assad's government aimed at ending the civil war. Frustrated by the government's failure to respond definitively, the opposition leader, Sheik Ahmad Moaz al-Khatib, gave it a Sunday deadline. 
Some antigovernment activists described the resumption of fighting, which had lapsed for the past few weeks, as part of a renewed effort by rebels to seize control of central Damascus, the Syrian capital, although that depiction seemed highly exaggerated. Witness accounts said many people were going about their business, while others noted that previous rebel claims of territorial gains in Damascus had almost always turned out to be embellished or unfounded.
Representatives of the Military Council of Damascus, an insurgent group, said that at least 33 members of President Assad's security forces in Damascus had surrendered, while others had fled central Al Abasiyeen Square, and that other government forces had erected roadblocks on all access streets to the area to thwart the movement of rebel fighters.
Salam Mohammed, an activist in Damascus, described Al Abasiyeen Square as ''on fire,'' and a video clip uploaded on YouTube showed a thick column of black smoke spiraling over the area while the sound of shelling could be heard. A voice said the shelling had started a fire. The Local Coordination Committees, an anti-Assad activist network in Syria, reported gunfire in nearby streets.
Firas al-Horani, a military council spokesman, said fighters of the Free Syrian Army, the main armed opposition group, were in control of the square. He also said, ''The capital, Damascus, is in a state of paralysis at the moment, and clashes are in full force in the streets.''
It was impossible to confirm Mr. Horani's assertions or the extent of the fighting because of Syrian government restrictions on foreign news organizations. But Syria's state-run news media said insurgent claims of combat success in Damascus were false. ''Those are miserable attempts to raise the morale of terrorists who are fleeing our valiant armed forces,'' said SANA, the official news agency.
Deadly violence was also reported in Palmyra, a town in Homs Province that is the site of a notorious prison where Mr. Assad's father, Hafez al-Assad, ordered the summary execution of about 1,000 prisoners during an uprising against his family's grip on power in the 1980s.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based group with a network of contacts inside Syria, said two booby-trapped cars exploded near the military intelligence and state security branches, killing at least 12 members of the security forces and wounding more than 20. The observatory said government forces were deployed throughout Palmyra afterward, engaging in gun battles with insurgents that left at least eight civilians wounded in the cross-fire.
SANA also reported an attack but said it was caused by two suicide bombers in a residential part of the town, killing an unspecified number of civilians.
The new mayhem came as discord appeared to grow within the National Coalition of Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, the umbrella anti-Assad group, over a proposal made on Jan. 30 by Sheik Khatib, its leader, to engage in talks with Mr. Assad's government aimed at ending the nearly two-year-old conflict, which has left more than 60,000 people dead.
Although Sheik Khatib's proposal included a number of conditions, including the release of prisoners, it broke a longstanding principle that Mr. Assad must relinquish power before any talks can begin.
Many of Sheik Khatib's colleagues grudgingly agreed to go along with the proposal after it had been made, but critical voices have been rising, especially among the coalition's more militant elements, who have never trusted Mr. Assad and have concluded that any negotiation is a waste of time.
In what appeared to be an acknowledgment of the discord, Sheik Khatib said in an interview with the BBC's Arabic service from his headquarters in Cairo on Wednesday that his own patience with the Syrian government was running out. Sheik Khatib gave the government until Sunday to release prisoners, especially women, or ''the initiative will be broken.''
In a new video uploaded on YouTube, a cleric from the Nusra Front, an anti-Assad Islamist militant group that the Obama administration has classified as a terrorist organization, said that brute force against Mr. Assad and his disciples was the only solution.
''We will cut their heads, we swear to kill them all, and they will see our worst war,'' said the cleric, who spoke in Libyan-accented Arabic at a mosque in the contested northern city of Aleppo, holding a sword in his right hand. ''No for the negotiations, no for the talks, no retreat in a jihad for God's sake.''

Tunisia Moves to Contain Fallout After Opposition Figure Is Assassinated

BYLINE: By MONICA MARKS and KAREEM FAHIM; Monica Marks reported from Tunis, and Kareem Fahim from Cairo. Reporting was contributed by Gerry Mullany from Hong Kong, Mayy El Sheikh from Cairo, David D. Kirkpatrick from Antakya, Turkey, and Brian Knowlton from Washington.

TUNIS -- Tunisian officials moved quickly Wednesday to contain the fallout after a leading opposition figure was assassinated outside his home. They announced that they would restructure the Islamist-led government and form a national unity cabinet as thousands took to the streets in protests that security forces beat back with tear gas.
The killing of the politician, Chokri Belaid, one of Tunisia's best-known human rights defenders and a fierce critic of the ruling Islamist party, placed dangerous new strains on a society struggling to reconcile its identity as a long-vaunted bastion of Arab secularism with its new role as a proving ground for one of the region's ascendant Islamist parties. 
The explosion of popular anger, which led to the death of a police officer in the capital, posed a severe challenge to the governing party, Ennahda, which came to power promising a model government that blended Islamist principles with tolerant pluralism.
Mr. Belaid was shot and killed outside his home in an upscale Tunis neighborhood as he was getting into his car on Wednesday morning. The interior minister, citing witnesses, said that two unidentified gunmen had fired on Mr. Belaid, striking him with four bullets.
The killing, which analysts said was the first confirmed political assassination here since the overthrow of the autocratic leader, Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, was a dark turn for the country that was the birthplace of the Arab uprisings of two years ago. It resonated in countries like Egypt and Libya that are struggling to contain political violence while looking to Tunisia's turbulent but hopeful transition as a reassuring example.
''Confronting violence, radicalism and the forces of darkness is the main priority for societies if they want freedom and democracy,'' Amr Hamzawy, a member of Egypt's main secular opposition coalition, wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. ''Assassinating Chokri Belaid is warning bell in Tunisia, and in Egypt too.''
The response by Tunisian officials was being closely watched. President Moncef Marzouki cut short an overseas trip to deal with the crisis. The prime minister, Hamadi Jebali, called the killing a ''heinous crime against the Tunisian people, against the principles of the revolution and the values of tolerance and acceptance of the other.''
Bowing to the outrage, he said cabinet ministers would be replaced with technocrats not tied to any party until elections can be held.
The announcement, which had been expected for months, held out the promise that Tunisia might continue to avoid the political chaos that has plagued its neighbors. Since the uprising, the country has held successful elections, leading to a coalition government merging Ennahda and two center-left parties. An assembly writing the country's constitution has circumscribed the role of Islamic law, allowing Tunisia to avoid the arguments over basic legal matters that have led to protracted unrest in Egypt.
The struggle over identity here has taken a different form, as hard-line Islamists have pressured Ennhada to take a more conservative path. Secular groups have faulted Ennahda for failing to confront the hard-liners, or for secretly supporting them. The restructuring does not completely loosen Ennahda's hold on political power.
The killing remained a mystery on Wednesday. The authorities did not announce any arrests, saying only that witnesses said the gunmen had appeared to be no more than 30 years old. Among Mr. Belaid's colleagues and relatives, suspicions immediately fell on the hard-line Islamists known as Salafists, some of whom have marred the transition with acts of violence, including attacks on liquor stores and Sufi mausoleums.
Mr. Belaid, a leading member of Tunisia's leftist opposition alliance, criticized the governing party for turning a blind eye to criminal acts by the Salafists, and had received a string of death threats for his political stands, his family said.
In a chilling prelude to his death, in a television interview on Tuesday, Mr. Belaid accused Ennahda of giving ''an official green light'' to political violence. Separately, he accused ''Ennahda mercenaries and Salafists'' of attacking a meeting of his supporters on Saturday.
His wife, Besma Khalfaoui, blamed Ennahda and told Tunisia's state news agency that the authorities had ignored her husband's pleas for protection during four months of death threats.
In a stunned Tunisia, as news of the killing spread, thousands poured into the streets in the capital and other cities. A crowd gathered in front of the interior ministry, a massive building that is still a hated symbol of Mr. Ben Ali and his security services, to express anger at the new government. ''Resignation, resignation, the cabinet of treason,'' people shouted.
Riot police officers fired tear gas into the crowds and plainclothes security officers beat protesters, witnesses said, in scenes that recalled the uprising two years ago. In other cities, protesters attacked Ennahda's offices.
The party vigorously denied any role in the killing, but the damage to its reputation seemed difficult to repair.
Salman Shaikh, director of the Brookings Doha Center, said the assassination was a blow to the aspirations of Islamist parties taking the reins in democratic transitions in the region, most notably in Egypt and Tunisia. In Egypt, he said, the Islamists have failed to build consensus and trust, relying instead on a narrow majoritarianism. In Tunisia, he said, they built a coalition with liberals but failed to take a stand against more hard-line Islamists competing for support on their right.
''Facing down extremists -- Islamists find that very difficult,'' Mr. Shaikh said.
In Tunisia, he said, the extremists included not only Salafis but more militant actors closer to Al Qaeda. ''They have not been very quiet in terms of their intentions, and yet Ennahda has not taken them on,'' he said.
In Tunisia, some hoped that the killing would serve as a warning not just about the dangers of political violence, but also about the authorities' refusal to confront it. Amna Guellali, a Human Rights Watch researcher based in Tunis, said the group had documented numerous attacks on activists, journalists and political figures by various groups, including the Salafis.
''The victims filed complaints to local tribunals, but never heard anything back,'' she said. ''There is a trend of impunity. This impunity can lead to emboldening'' attackers.
''Yesterday, Chokri called for a national dialogue to confront political violence,'' she said. ''This just adds to the tragedy.''

Looted Libyan Arms in Mali May Have Shifted Conflict's Path

BYLINE: By C. J. CHIVERS

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 4

LENGTH: 1109 words

Since the war that toppled Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi began in 2011, arms-tracking analysts have warned that weapons looted from the colonel's stockpiles could find their way to militants in sub-Saharan Africa.
Although public evidence for transfers has been scarce or not fully verifiable, persistent accounts of smuggled arms reaching Mali have circulated for more than a year, just as reports have repeatedly suggested that weapons formerly in Libya were turning up in Egypt, Gaza, Chad, Lebanon, Syria and elsewhere.
In the case of Mali, the reports appeared alongside signs of the growing strength of jihadists in the country's north. The timing, researchers said, suggested that weapons from Libya had changed the course of Mali's war -- so much so that the French military eventually intervened. 
Recent photographs from Mali provide perhaps the clearest publicly available indication yet that these transfers have in fact occurred.
The first photograph, filed on Jan. 26 by Reuters, shows a slightly damaged finned projectile resting on the dirt in Konna, the city in central Mali from which a French-led military attack expelled militants last month. A New York Times photographer later documented more examples of the same weapons.
The projectiles in question were NR-160s, antitank munitions manufactured by a now-defunct company in Belgium that in the 1970s and 1980s extensively sold arms to Colonel Qaddafi's military. Fired through American-designed recoilless rifles that have a history in Libya since early in the cold war, the projectiles were identical to ordnance documented in Libya in 2011.
They had been left behind in Konna by Islamists who had been pounded by an aerial attack, and suffered many losses.
Many other types of weapons that could have come from Libya have been present in the fighting in Mali, including Soviet-era assault rifles, machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades. Unlike these items, the NR-160 was not a widely distributed or globally produced export product that could have come from myriad sources. It was a peculiar item with a limited circulation and a well-established tie to Libya.
When combined with images of other weapons strongly associated with Libya that have also turned up in Mali, the presence of NR-160s suggests that evidence is hardening that weapons cast loose in Libya are contributing to instability elsewhere, perhaps most vividly in Mali.
It also offers insight into arms deals that have gone awry, and foreign policy choices that had costly, unintended effects.
''What was incredible in Libya was how much was there, and the things that turned up that haven't been seen anywhere else,'' said Neil Corney of the Omega Research Foundation, which examines the manufacture and circulation of military and police equipment.
Of the likely effects of Libyan weapons on Mali, he said, ''There was a sudden push by better armed, better equipped and better organized forces in Mali that pushed Mali's army out.''
''The timing,'' he said, ''was right.''
According to the conventional wisdom of governments and arms manufacturers, well-coordinated arms exports can help strengthen vulnerable states, professionalize military forces and promote stability.
In Libya, the opposite occurred, and the related dangers radiated outward.
This presumed influx of weapons to Mali from Libya has in turn underscored the unwanted effects of a war supported by the West, and raised questions anew about why NATO and the allied militaries that helped defeat the Qaddafi military did little to contain weapons that foreign military intervention helped set loose.
In the case of the NR-160s, several strands of evidence point to Libya as the source.
A projectile with an armor-penetrating shaped charge, the NR-160 was one of several rounds in the 106-millimeter class produced by Poudreries Rיunies de Belgique, a Belgian company that sold ordnance to Libya in the early Qaddafi era.
These rounds were manufactured for M40 recoilless rifles, which were designed in the United States in the 1950s.
As part of efforts to prop up King Idris of Libya and retain access to an air base near Tripoli, the State Department and the Pentagon helped create and equip Libya's army in the 1950s and 1960s. The engagement included providing the nascent army with recoilless rifles.
By 1969, Washington's ambition had backfired. Rather than protect the monarchy, the army nurtured by the United States had produced Colonel Qaddafi, who overthrew the throne and forced the United States to abandon the base.
After the coup, as Colonel Qaddafi sought new sources for weapons, the Belgian company helped satisfy Libya's procurement desires. It sold Libya many classes of ordnance, including land mines and antitank projectiles.
Research in Belgium's state archives by Damien Spleeters, an independent arms researcher, found that from 1973 to 1980, the company received multiple licenses to ship 106-millimeter recoilless rifle rounds to the ''Directorate Military -- Tripoli, Libya.''
Mr. Spleeters's searches of public records found no evidence of other transfers of 106-millimeter rounds to any other country in the region, with the exception of a 1971 license approving a tiny shipment -- 200 rounds -- to Morocco. One license alone for shipments of 106-millimeter rounds to Libya, by contrast, authorized the transfer of 30,000 rounds.
For decades these arms were locked up within Colonel Qaddafi's secretive state, their quantities unknown. The Belgian company's 106-millimeter rounds resurfaced spectacularly in 2011, used by both Qaddafi loyalists and rebels who seized them from captured government stockpiles.
The M40 ultimately proved to be one of the most effective weapons that the rebels acquired, and it was repeatedly used to breach buildings where pro-Qaddafi soldiers had hidden.
As the war ran its course, Belgian 106-millimeter rounds and their associated wooden crates were photographed several times by The Times, by rebel logisticians and later by bomb disposal technicians.
The projectiles found in Mali, whose army, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, does not possess M40 recoilless rifles, match these records. One arms-trafficking researcher who has examined the stocks of many African states said the photographs of the projectiles in Konna documented a weapon that had no likely regional source other than Libya.
''From what I have seen in the sort of fossil record in situ in armories of Western African states, you don't find this particular weapon,'' said James Bevan, director of Conflict Armament Research, a private arms-tracking company in Britain. ''We would have seen them. And we haven't.''

An autopsy report indicates a teenage Mexican boy who was apparently fatally shot by a United States Border Patrol agent in October was struck by at least eight bullets, all but one hitting him in the back. The report from medical examiners in Mexico describes several other wounds, but it is unclear if they account for additional bullets. Luis Parra, a lawyer for the family of the boy, Josי Antonio Elena Rodrםguez, says he believes that the agent used excessive force. Border Patrol officials declined to comment on the autopsy report Thursday. The Border Patrol says agents responded on Oct. 10 to reports of drug smugglers at the fence along the border with Mexico in Nogales, Ariz. The agency says one agent opened fire through the fence as United States authorities were pelted with rocks.

Nineteen people accused of being members of a Congolese rebel group, including one American citizen, planned to overthrow President Joseph Kabila of the Democratic Republic of Congo and offered mining rights in Congo in exchange for weapons and training, a South African prosecutor said Thursday. The suspects asked South African undercover officers posing as mercenaries for machine guns, radios and surface-to-air missiles and for help to set up a training camp, said the prosecutor, Shaun Abrahams. They were arrested Tuesday as they were on their way to what they believed would be their camp, Mr. Abrahams said. One of the suspects was identified as James Kazongo, an American citizen, said an American Embassy spokesman.

Aretha Aoki and Benjamin Kimitch (Thursday through Feb. 16) In a shared program Aretha Aoki presents ''Las Gravitas,'' a solo ''about making a solo,'' according to the Danspace Web site, which tells us that it vacillates ''between insularity and expansiveness.'' (Those glazing over as you read this, take heart: it's the dance that matters, not the description, which the poor choreographers often have to come up with before they've created a step.) The other part of the program offers a duo by Benjamin Kimitich, whose training includes Chinese folk dance, and whose piece, set to a live, original score by Matthew Flory Meade, ''meditates on loss and impermanence.'' At 8 p.m., Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, danspaceproject.org; $18. (Roslyn Sulcas) 
Karole Armitage/Armitage Gone! Dance (Friday and Saturday) Karole Armitage has borne the heavy mantle of innovation since her 1981 ''Drastic-Classicism,'' a vision of punk ballerinas in feet-behind-head extensions set to earsplitting guitar. The premiere of that work was at the then-named Dance Theater Workshop, now New York Live Arts, where Ms. Armitage's company will present her new work, ''Mechanics of the Dance Machine,'' set to music by Gabriel Prokofiev (grandson of the more famous Serge). In this piece the choreographer invites the audience onstage to participate in the performance by following light cues, allowing them to see the dancers up close. In a nontheater environment, you'd just call it an installation. But therein lies the challenge for Ms. Armitage: constructing a coherent theatrical experience from this particular way of presenting a work. An added draw: The former New York City Ballet principal dancer Charles Askegard has joined the cast. At 7:30 p.m., New York Live Arts, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077, newyorklivearts.org; $40, $32 for students and 65+. (Sulcas)
&#x2605; Ronald K. Brown/Evidence (Tuesday through Thursday; through Feb. 17) Ronald K. Brown is that rare creature: a choreographer whose works are densely packed with meaning but also so sheerly enjoyable at a kinetic, physical level that you have no need to worry about ''understanding'' anything. His company, Evidence, brings two programs to the Joyce: in Program A, Mr. Brown offers a new piece, ''Torch,'' alongside ''Order My Steps'' and excerpts from ''Incidents,'' a 1998 piece for five women inspired by (if that's the phrase) images of female slavery and using music by the Staple Singers, Aretha Franklin and Wunmi Olaiya. On the same program is an excerpt from ''Ife/My Heart,'' danced by Matthew Rushing from the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, for which Mr. Brown created this buoyant yet introspective piece in 2005. On Program B is the full-length ''Walking Out the Dark,'' to the music of Francisco Mora and Sweet Honey in the Rock, and ''Upside Down'' set to music by Fela Kuti. (Yes, ''Fela!'') Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $10 to $49. (Sulcas)
Buglisi Dance Theater (Friday through Sunday) Martha Graham's dramatic influence runs heavily through the work of Jacqulyn Buglisi, who established this company with other alumni of the Martha Graham Dance Company. Some of those founding members return to perform in the troupe's 20th anniversary season, which features four world premieres (one by the emerging choreographer Katarzyna Skarpetowska), six repertory works, and excerpts from ''Arenal'' by Spain's esteemed Nacho Duato. Luminaries from the ballet world -- Martine van Hamel and Charles Askegard -- make guest appearances. Friday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $10 to $39. (Siobhan Burke)
Nai-Ni Chen Dance (Saturday and Sunday) To celebrate the Chinese new year, the Nai-Ni Chen Dance company offers ''The Year of the Serpent,'' which will include a Dragon Dance and a Lion Dance (obligatory to welcome the new year). There will also be a Chinese opera excerpt from ''Legend of the White Serpent''; traditional dances from the Yunan province; the Pipa master musician, Hong Tao Sun; and ''Whirlwind,'' a new piece by Ms. Chen set to music by Glen Velez. Crafts, origami and paper cutting exhibits will be displayed in the lobby, and a 12-course banquet at a nearby restaurant is being offered as a part of Sunday's show. At 2 p.m., New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722, njpac.org; $25. (Sulcas)
CoolNY Dance Festival (Friday through Sunday) One of several eclectic dance festivals organized annually by the choreographer Young Soon Kim, CoolNY returns for its 10th year with 60 companies presented over two weeks. Ms. Kim clearly wants to provide opportunities for emerging choreographers, but it's unclear what connects the artists on each of 10 programs. This is a decidedly mixed-bag affair. Friday at 7 and 9 p.m., Saturday at 2 and 7 p.m., Sunday at 4 and 6 p.m., John Ryan Theater, 25 Jay Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, whitewavedance.com. (Burke)
&#x2605; DanceNow (Thursday through Feb. 16) In 2003 the organization DanceNow began to commission new works for the extremely unlikely, coffee-table-size stage at Joe's Pub. The in-the-face-of-all-reason strategy paid off as choreographers outdid themselves finding ingenious ways to use the limited space, and in making the most of the intimate, cabaret-style seating and ambience. To celebrate their 10th anniversary at Joe's Pub, the DanceNow directors, Robin Staff, Sydney Skybetter and Tamara Greenfield, are presenting ''Dorothy, Annie, Maria,'' a program of excerpts from three of the most successful of these productions, each inspired by a famous musical. ''Dorothy'' comes from Nicholas Leichter's 2010 ''The Whiz: Emerald City'' (''a 'Wizard of Oz' for the Obama generation,'' according to the publicity materials); ''Annie,'' from David Parker and the Bang Group's 2009 ''ShowDown,'' a witty take on ''Annie Get Your Gun''; and ''Maria'' from the best of them all, Doug Elkins's 2006 ''Frהulein Maria,'' an irreverent, witty, loving homage to ''The Sound of Music.'' If you saw these pieces at the time, you'll want to go again. If you missed them then, don't miss them now. At 7 p.m., doors open at 6, Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $15 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sulcas)
&#x2605; Douglas Dunn (Friday and Saturday) Mr. Dunn's ''Cassations,'' glowingly received at its December premiere at the 92nd Street Y, is already returning. Danspace Project remounts the beguiling suite of dances, set to operatic arias and structured around the coming together and pulling apart of groups of men and women. It may sound simple, but Mr. Dunn has a way of mining layers of complexity from the most basic foundation. At 8 p.m., Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, danspaceproject.org; $18. (Burke)
&#x2605; Harrison Atelier with Silas Riener (Friday and Saturday) The design collective Harrison Atelier, directed by a Yale architecture professor (Ariane Harrison) and a designer and biotechnologist (Seth Harrison), presents its second collaboration with the choreographer Silas Riener. If ''Veal'' is anything like their 2011 ''Pharmacophore: Architectural Placebo,'' it will plunge its audience into a futuristic landscape where human bodies and synthetic materials form an eerie symbiosis. Five installations (including a performance choreographed by Mr. Riener) spring up around modern theories and ancient myths about the slaughtering of animals and the displacement of nature by technology. At 7:30 p.m., Invisible Dog Art Center, 51 Bergen Street, Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, (347) 560-3641, theinvisibledog.org, reservation requests can be e-mailed to simon@theinvisibledog.org; $10 suggested donation. (Burke)
&#x2605; Jennifer Monson (Thursday; through Feb. 23) Jennifer Monson is a veteran improviser and an intrepid explorer of the natural world who spent many years studying and producing works based on her investigations of animal navigations and migrations. ''Live Dancing Archive'' is her first indoor piece in eight years, and it's a solo that explores the dancing body as, according to The Kitchen's Web site, ''physical archive of experience and place.'' As indeed it always is. There is also a video installation by Robin Vachal that uses documentation from a major 2002 project, ''Bird Brain Osprey Migration,'' and lighting by Joe Levasseur. At 8 p.m., The Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793, Ext. 11, thekitchen.org; $15. (Sulcas)
&#x2605; New York City Ballet (Friday through Sunday, Wednesday and Thursday; through Feb. 24) This weekend is this season's last chance to get in a bit of City Ballet repertory before the two-week run of ''Sleeping Beauty'' that closes the season. If you didn't catch Justin ''talk of the town'' Peck's new ''Paz de la Jolla'' at its recent premiere, you can see its last outing this season on Friday's excellent program that includes Alexei Ratmansky's ''Concerto DSCH'' and Balanchine's ''Symphony in C.'' Saturday and Sunday afternoons boast a no-less excellent ''Symphonic Balanchine'' lineup, with ''Western Symphony,'' ''Symphony in 3 Movements'' and ''Symphony in C.'' Saturday night has an early work by Peter Martins, ''The Waltz Project,'' alongside Jerome Robbins's ''N.Y. Export: Opus Jazz'' and ''Symphony in 3 Movements.'' On Wednesday night ''Sleeping Beauty'' sweeps in: Megan Fairchild, Joaquin de Luz and Sara Mearns are the principals on the opening night; Ashley Bouder, Andrew Veyette and Janie Taylor follow on Thursday. Friday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Wednesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., David H. Koch Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 496-0600, nycballet.com; $29 to $155. (Sulcas)
&#x2605; Pacific Northwest Ballet (Wednesday though Feb. 16) Ballet lovers will be flocking to see what Pacific Northwest Ballet looks like under the direction of Peter Boal, a beloved former New York City Ballet principal who managed to get his troupe to the Joyce in 2010 for a selection of chamber works, but hasn't, until now, been able to show off the full company in a larger New York theater. The company arrives with two programs -- a gold-standard Balanchine mixed bill (''Concerto Barocco,'' ''Agon'' and ''Apollo''), and Jean-Christophe Maillot's full-length ''Romיo et Juliette.'' Purists take note that this ''Agon,'' staged by Francia Russell (a co-director of Pacific Northwest Ballet with her husband, Kent Stowell, before Mr. Boal took over in 2005), is an earlier version than the one that City Ballet dances. (This will add grist to the mill; there is nothing New York ballet audiences like better than to contrast and compare other companies to the Balanchine home ground of City Ballet.) And Mr. Maillot's highly theatrical ''Romיo'' should give the dancers a chance to show their dramatic colors. Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., next Friday at 8 p.m., City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org; $25 to $120. (Sulcas)
SPLICE: Neal Beasley and Bradley Teal Ellis (Friday and Saturday) The choreographers in this series generally split the bill neatly in two. But Mr. Beasley, a dancer with Trisha Brown, and Mr. Ellis, a seasoned practitioner of contact improvisation, are taking a fresh approach to the shared-evening format, interweaving vignettes of their work and allowing viewers to wander throughout the space. Mr. Beasley's ''every adam belonging to me'' and Mr. Ellis's ''(American)Guilt'' seem like a natural pairing (at least on paper), both questioning traditional representations of gender and American identity. Friday at 7:30 p.m., Saturday at 3 and 7:30 p.m., Dance New Amsterdam, 280 Broadway, at Chambers Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 625-8369, dnadance.org; $12 in advance, $17 day of performance, $14 for students and 65+. (Burke)
Meryl Tankard (Friday and Saturday) In honor of the centennial of ''The Rite of Spring,'' Ms. Tankard, one of Australia's best-known contemporary dance makers, offers the New York premiere of her take on that 1913 ballet, ''The Oracle.'' The explosive solo spotlights the virtuosic Australian dancer Paul White, who will soon follow in Ms. Tankard's footsteps when he joins Tanztheater Wuppertal (the company founded by Pina Bausch), where Ms. Tankard danced for 10 years. At 8 p.m., N.Y.U. Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, 566 La Guardia Place, at Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, (212) 352-3101, nyuskirball.org; $30 to $49. (Burke)

A Woman Who Unleashes Her Inner Medusa on an Everyman

BYLINE: By MANOHLA DARGIS

SECTION: Section C; Column 0; Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk; MOVIE REVIEW; Pg. 10

LENGTH: 777 words

''Identity Thief,'' a lazy comedy about a naughty woman and the uptight man she has her way with, has no business being funny. The story turns on a thief who sometimes goes by Diana (Melissa McCarthy), who wreaks havoc on a milquetoast, Sandy Patterson (Jason Bateman), by stealing his credit cards and more. The two become one of those belligerent odd couples who are forced on the road together chockablock with stereotypes, gun violence, visual clichיs and cruel comedy. Diana, a kewpie doll with a crazy smile and five-alarm blaze of hair, is the target of most of the jokes, but until the filmmakers put out her fire with a bucket of tears and sentimental slop, she's also the movie's bliss. 
Ms. McCarthy shares top billing with Mr. Bateman, but she is the supernova who burns up this show, which was written by Craig Mazin and directed by Seth Gordon. Diana enters shortly before Sandy is hired for a job that bumps his income to six figures from five. An Everyman, Sandy comes with the usual pretty wife (Amanda Peet) and cute kids, with another on the way. More unusually, the family is almost broke and lives in an apartment instead of one of those movie dream houses that pass as middle-class homes. Sandy's new position represents a step up for the family, which means that Diana doesn't just rip him off, she also threatens his upward mobility.
Class hovers in the background throughout ''Identity Thief,'' adding some unexpected piquancy to the generic proceedings. Early in the movie there's an aggressively ugly-funny scene between Sandy and a belligerent 1 percenter, Harold Cornish (Jon Favreau), who namedrops ''The Fountainhead.'' For a few seconds it feels as if someone here were paying attention. Once Sandy finds Diana, who's nesting in a Florida house that looks as if it had been dipped in a vat of Pepto-Bismol, the movie enters more predicable territory. From her gut-churning pink home to the blue shadow plastered on her eyes, Sandy is a cornucopia of conventional bad taste. She's a liar and a thief, but she's also tacky, low-rent, vulgar, with a mouth and manners as loud as the floral prints she wears.
She is, in other words, the unruly woman, the woman of glorious excess who, with her sharp, funny tongue and expansive physicality dominates the screen and her male co-stars, often by playing off an idea of femininity. Diana isn't the brilliant, gender-bending presence that Ms. McCarthy inhabited so brilliantly in ''Bridesmaids,'' a movie that rejoiced in messy female behavior. Even so, from the moment Diana comes on screen in ''Identity Thief,'' sugar-talking Sandy out of his information while she's slurping a soda, Ms. McCarthy owns the movie. The character may be drawn in broad strokes, but Ms. McCarthy slips between the saucy and the demonic with exquisite effortlessness, fluttering her lashes and flashing her dimples one minute, unleashing her inner Medusa the next.
This frenzy doesn't endure, though that is to be expected. Real anarchy has no place in an entertainment like ''Identity Thief'': order must be restored, the family reunited, the wild woman tamed. Diana will teach Sandy something, and he will teach her something in turn, and then everything will fit tidily, phonily together, or something like that. That said, as is the case with other unsatisfactory diversions, it is entirely possible to ignore the worst parts of this movie, to drift along during the lulls, slide over the half-baked jokes and just wait for Ms. McCarthy and Mr. Bateman to do their things. (The character actor Eric Stonestreet does his part too.) They deserve better vehicles, and we deserve better movies, but at least we can look forward to new episodes of ''Arrested Development'' in May.
''Identity Thief'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Gun violence, physical assaults, crude language and a sustained sexual scene involving a great deal of implied inventive choreography.

Pastor Is Sorry For His Role In a Service

BYLINE: By SHARON OTTERMAN

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 19

LENGTH: 675 words

A Lutheran pastor who participated in an interfaith prayer service in Newtown, Conn., in the days after the Sandy Hook massacre has apologized after being criticized by the leader of his denomination for violating its prohibition against joint worship with other religions.
The Rev. Rob Morris, a new pastor who lost one of the members of his congregation in the shooting, defended himself in an open letter published by the church, saying that before the tragedy, he had spent hours with his congregation educating them about the differences between Lutheran teaching ''and the teachings of false religions such as Islam or Baha'i,'' both of which had representatives at the interfaith service. He also noted that, in his own prayer at the service, he had spoken about Jesus and quoted from the Bible. 
''I believed my participation to be, not an act of joint worship, but an act of community chaplaincy,'' he wrote.
But he also apologized.
''To those who believe that I have endorsed false teaching, I assure you that was not my intent, and I give you my unreserved apologies,'' he wrote.
Mr. Morris, serving his first year of ministry as pastor of Christ the King Lutheran Church in Newtown, attracted attention within his denomination when he gave the benediction at the high-profile memorial service on Dec. 16 that was attended by President Obama, the families of the dead, and clergy members from many religions, including the Muslim and Baha'i faiths.
In the days after the interfaith service, criticism of Mr. Morris mounted within his denomination, the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod, a 2.3-million-member church that is more conservative theologically than the larger Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. The Missouri Synod bars joint worship with other religions, because, it says, participation could be seen as an endorsement of faiths that do not regard Jesus alone as savior or as a suggestion that differences between religions are not important.
The Rev. Matthew C. Harrison, president of the Missouri Synod, called on Mr. Morris to apologize, which he did.
''There is sometimes a real tension between wanting to bear witness to Christ and at the same time avoiding situations which may give the impression that our differences with respect to who God is, who Jesus is, how he deals with us and how we get to Heaven, really don't matter in the end,'' Mr. Harrison wrote in an open letter on the Web.
Because it was not Mr. Morris's intention to give the impression that the other faiths were equally valid, Mr. Harrison called on Lutherans upset by what had happened to accept Mr. Morris's apology and support him and his congregation ''especially in providing funding for Christ the King as it continues to care for victims,'' he wrote in his letter.
A spokeswoman for the denomination, Vicki Biggs, added words of support on Thursday.''We are proud of the work Pastor Morris has done in Newtown and how he has served the community in so many ways,'' she said.
The Newtown reprimand was not the first time a pastor from the Missouri Synod has been chastised for taking part in an interfaith service after a national tragedy. In the weeks after the Sept. 11 attacks, the Rev. David H. Benke, the pastor of St. Peter's Lutheran Church in Brooklyn and the equivalent of a bishop in the church hierarchy, was suspended from ministry for taking part in a huge interfaith prayer service held at Yankee Stadium.
Mr. Benke had broken the First Commandment -- ''I am the Lord thy God'' -- by worshiping with ''pagans,'' including Muslim, Sikh and Hindu clergy members, the Rev. Wallace Schulz, a senior official of the church, said then. Mr. Benke refused to apologize, and was cleared by a church panel in 2003 and permitted to return to ministry.
Asked for comment on the Newtown situation on Thursday, Mr. Benke said he did not agree with the denomination's decision to ask Mr. Morris to apologize. ''I am on the side of giving Christian witness in the public square and not vacating it,'' he said. ''If we don't show up, who can receive our witness?''

Some States Push Measures To Repel New U.S. Gun Laws

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 16

LENGTH: 857 words

DENVER -- A tide of anger at Washington's gun-control efforts is sweeping through statehouses from South Carolina to North Dakota, taking the form of laws that would let states ignore -- or at least resist -- any new national gun restrictions.
Lawmakers in at least 15 states have introduced bills that would nullify any new efforts to further restrict access to guns or high-capacity magazines within their borders. Some have provocative language calling for states to arrest and prosecute federal agents who dare to enforce new firearms regulations. 
Some of the measures have died quietly or been voted down amid concerns they are unconstitutional. Others are moving along with support from rural pro-gun Republicans, who say their constituents are threatened by Washington's push -- however halting and uncertain -- for stricter gun laws.
Quixotic as they may be, the nullification moves reach back to John C. Calhoun and the antebellum South, and tap a deep frustration with what conservative lawmakers call Washington's intrusion on the rights of states and gun owners. The spirit, while more muted, echoes the state-level backlash to President Obama's health care law in 2010.
''It's about citizens having the ability to be armed to protect themselves in their homes,'' said Casey Guernsey, a Missouri state representative and hunter who holds an annual coyote shoot in his district as a charity fund-raiser. His bill to block any new gun laws has 60 co-sponsors in the state's Republican-controlled House and is likely to come up for a hearing next week, he said.
''We aren't here to do the bidding of the federal government,'' he said. ''Whenever they go out of bounds, it's our responsibility to step up.''
They are supported by states' rights groups like the Tenth Amendment Center (named for the Constitutional provision that grants power to the states and people), and have allies among the scores of rural sheriffs who are objecting to new gun laws.
In Wyoming, home to some of the country's least restrictive gun regulations, a bill to exempt the state from any new gun-control laws sailed through the Republican-controlled House by a vote of 46 to 13 and is now headed to the State Senate.
The measure, called the Firearm Protection Act, declares that any new gun-control laws or executive orders that ban semiautomatic weapons or limit ammunition clip sizes are ''unenforceable'' in Wyoming. Any federal agent who tries to enforce gun-control measures would be guilty of a felony punishable by five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. It also allows the state's attorney general to defend Wyoming residents prosecuted for violating federal gun laws.
''I don't want to see federal agents arrested. That's not the goal,'' said Representative Mark Baker, a Republican from southwest Wyoming. ''It gives us a way to challenge them.''
Republicans sponsoring the legislation say they have been flooded with e-mails from their constituents praising the effort. The clamor for new gun laws after the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut has gratified many Democrats and politicians in heavily Democratic cities, but it is a creeping shadow in rural areas, where hunting and shooting are badges of identity as much as weekend diversions.
''Our citizens are very nervous,'' said Andrew G. Maragos, a North Dakota representative supporting a measure that would prevent any state employees -- like police officers -- from enforcing new national gun laws. ''Our culture is tied to guns. We're hunters. We have the best hunting in the world. The mere idea of any kind of restriction just makes them nervous.''
Even in Wyoming, the nullification law faces a hazy future. Gov. Matt Mead, a Republican, has raised concerns about putting the state's police officers and sheriffs at loggerheads with federal agents charged with enforcing federal gun laws. Legal experts and even lawyers for solidly Republican legislatures have warned that the Constitution's supremacy clause would allow federal gun laws to override any state measures.
Montana is an instructive example of the challenges these states face.
Three years ago, the state passed the Firearms Freedom Act, declaring that any guns manufactured and owned entirely inside the state were off-limits to the reach of federal laws. Gary S. Marbut, president of the Montana Shooting Sports Association, spent years pushing for the law. Once it passed, he asked the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives whether, without a federal license, he could now go into business making a bolt-action rifle for young shooters -- the Montana Buckaroo.
No way, the agency told him.
Mr. Marbut sued, saying their denials flew in the face of Montana's law. His case is to be heard in March before the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.
In Wyoming, Representative Kendell Kroeker, a Republican from Casper who introduced the state's nullification bill, said he welcomed a court fight.
''I would much rather have that challenge now, rather than when they show up to take citizens' guns away,'' Mr. Kroeker said. ''Let it be decided in the courts before it comes to bloodshed.''

45 Years Ago, a Stand That Turned Deadly

BYLINE: By SAMUEL G. FREEDMAN. 
Samuel G. Freedman, the On Religion columnist for The New York Times, is the author of a forthcoming book ''Breaking the Line'' about black college football and the civil rights struggle.

SECTION: Section B; Column 0; Sports Desk; Pg. 9

LENGTH: 1626 words

On a February night 45 years ago, a linebacker on the South Carolina State football team named Robert Lee Davis went with three or four teammates to a bowling alley just off the black college's campus in Orangeburg. Theirs was not an act of recreation but of political protest.
As expected, the alley's owner turned them away because only whites were admitted. Then the local police arrived to arrest the players for disturbing the peace. When other students nearby began to object, the officers drew their nightsticks and the beatings began.
Two nights later, on Feb. 8, 1968, Davis and a larger group of football players joined their fellow students in building a bonfire near the campus entrance in a demonstration against the police assault. This time, an all-white force of state troopers responded. By the time the lawmen were done firing, 3 students lay dead and 27 had been wounded. 
The Orangeburg Massacre, as the event came to be called, has grown over time into a landmark in civil rights history. More specifically, it stands as a tragically valiant episode in the history of political activism by black athletes, specifically the football players and the coach of South Carolina State.
One football player, Samuel Hammond, died in the hail of fire from the state troopers. Several others were injured, Davis severely enough to be temporarily paralyzed. In the aftermath of the shooting, defensive back Willis Ham and three other student-athletes made a protest run 42 miles from Orangeburg to the state capital of Columbia.
The players' protests at South Carolina State predated more famous examples of black athletic activism like the movement to boycott the 1968 Summer Olympics and the bowed-head, clenched-fist salutes from John Carlos and Tommie Smith on the medal stand during the Mexico City Games that year.
Black colleges on the whole were deeply involved in the civil rights movement, and though some athletes took up the cause, they tended to be the exception rather than the rule. Jesse Jackson was both a quarterback and a protest leader at North Carolina A&T. Willie Galimore, a star running back for Florida A&M and then the Chicago Bears, helped to integrate the Ponce de Leon Hotel in St. Augustine, Fla., a focus of civil rights protests. A defensive lineman for Grambling, Frederick Douglass Kirkpatrick, helped found and lead the Louisiana group Deacons for Defense and Justice, which guarded civil rights volunteers.
Still, on Friday's 45th anniversary of the Orangeburg Massacre, the movement at South Carolina State remains notable for the depth of commitment by athletes and for the bloody price the players paid.
''There was no play as vicious as that play,'' one of the wounded players, Harold Riley, recalled in an interview conducted for the Orangeburg Massacre Oral History Project. ''To see people crying and dying, you know, that kind of stuff. You don't die on the football field. You miss a play, and you get up and run another one. This play here was a play you never forget.''
The story of the South Carolina State football team and the Orangeburg Massacre began several years earlier, in a certain sense, with the arrival of two men. One was Oree Banks, who became coach in 1965. The other was Cleveland Sellers, the national program director for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, who started mobilizing students on the campus in early 1967.
Many presidents of black colleges -- as well as the coaches who worked for them -- felt an excruciating tension between the white governors and legislatures that controlled their jobs and the righteously restive students who had grown up amid Brown v. Board of Education, the Montgomery bus boycott and the March on Washington.
In both age and temperament, Banks bridged the groups. Though born in Mississippi, he had experienced integration while serving in the Army and earning bachelor's and master's degrees at Kansas State. In the same year when he took the South Carolina State job, Banks joined the N.A.A.C.P., a daring move at a time when some Southern states had outlawed membership in the group and the organization was routinely likened to the Communist Party.
In Orangeburg, Banks quickly set about reversing South Carolina State's football fortunes, going 22-4 in his first three seasons and developing such future pros as R. C. Gamble and James Johnson, known as Diesel. Just as significantly, he offered tacit approval when his players were drawn into the campus protest movement. Doing so put Banks at risk of being fired.
''It wasn't easy for me,'' Banks said in a 2011 interview. ''Probably some of the coaches back then would've put the emphasis on players not being involved. That wasn't what I was all about. I took an attitude that this is a part of the change in our country. This was a change that people needed to be concerned about.''
As for Sellers, when he started assisting a student protest group called The Cause, he deliberately sought out football players. ''The football team had an organization of their own, they had leaders, they had influence over the coeds,'' he said in an interview two years ago. ''It was an important ingredient to have them.''
The South Carolina State campus and Orangeburg had seen demonstrations against segregation in 1957, 1960 and 1963, the last quashed by local police wielding fire hoses. Sellers had also surmised correctly that the football players had experienced inequality through the sport they loved: second-rate facilities and equipment, road trips without any stops at restaurants or to use public restrooms.
Some of the players from Charleston, like Ham, had already been exposed to civil rights activity. Others, like quarterback Johnny Jones, discovered the left-wing counterculture while working summer jobs in Northern factories.
All of the various influences, added together, overcame the prevailing concern for many athletes at black colleges. Their scholarships were often the only way they could afford to pursue a college degree. Being stripped of a scholarship, and conceivably being kicked out of school, meant not only losing that dream but becoming instantly eligible for the Vietnam War draft.
When the South Carolina State players wavered and went to Banks for advice, he did not tell them what to do, at least not overtly. What he did say, Jones recalled, was: ''You're making history. Don't be on the wrong side of it.''
The pace of that history at South Carolina State quickened through 1967. The university's president, Benner C. Turner, was already under criticism from The Cause for his timidity on civil rights -- not allowing an N.A.A.C.P. chapter on campus, erecting a fence to prevent large demonstrations -- when he dismissed two math instructors, both of them young white men from the North, who had been persistently raising the issue of inadequate funds and facilities at the college.
In response, several hundred students, including many football players, picketed on the front lawn of Turner's residence. He expelled three of the protest leaders, which resulted in an even larger demonstration, involving roughly a third of the college's 1,500 students, and subsequently a two-week boycott of classes honored by 90 percent of the student body.
Turner was dismissed after the spring term for having lost control of the campus. The student movement, emboldened by its success, picked up the decade-long campaign against segregation in Orangeburg, focusing on a downtown bowling alley.
The state police were dispatching agents to investigate Sellers and his followers. But the football players, already politicized, were not backing down. ''There's an expression,'' Ham recalled decades later of the mood at the time, ''that it's better to ask forgiveness than to ask permission.''
The stage was set for the football players' visit to the bowling alley Feb. 6 and for the state troopers' armed reply Feb. 8. Jack Bass, the co-author with Jack Nelson of the definitive history of the episode, ''The Orangeburg Massacre,'' wrote of that night's events:
''After two days of escalating tension, a fire truck was called to douse a bonfire lit by students on a street in front of the campus. State troopers -- all of them white, with little training in crowd control -- moved to protect the firefighters. As more than 100 students retreated to the campus interior, a tossed banister rail struck one trooper in the face. He fell to the ground bleeding. Five minutes later, almost 70 law enforcement officers lined the edge of the campus. They were armed with carbines, pistols and riot guns ... loaded with lethal buckshot.''
Soon after the firing started on fleeing students, Robert Lee Davis found himself laying on the ground next to his teammate, Samuel Hammond, both of them bleeding. ''He said, 'Do you think I'm going to live?' '' Davis recounted in an oral history. ''I said, 'Sam, you are going to be all right, buddy.' And the next time I looked over, he was dead. I had to put my hand over his eyes.''
In the aftermath, nine state troopers were rapidly acquitted of charges in the shootings. Only Sellers of the S.N.C.C. was convicted of a crime. He spent seven months in prison for ''inciting a riot.''
It took decades for the wrongs to be acknowledged. Sellers was pardoned in 1993, and in 2003, Mark Sanford, South Carolina's governor at the time, issued a formal apology for the shootings. Yet the specific role of black athletes has been largely subsumed in the larger story.
Sellers, now the president of Voorhees College in South Carolina, is one who does remember it. ''You could talk to the football players about the struggle and they could relate it to sports,'' he said. ''How do you develop your manhood? They had the idea to be competitive and to try to win.''

Manhunt On for Ex-Officer Accused of Police Vendetta

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY and IAN LOVETT; Nuran Alteir contributed reporting from La Palma, Calif.; Will Carless from San Diego; and Kitty Bennett from Tampa, Fla.

LENGTH: 1110 words

LOS ANGELES -- A former Navy reservist who was fired from the Los Angeles Police Department in 2008 has gone on a murderous rampage aimed at police officers and their families, law enforcement officials said Thursday, killing at least three people -- including an 11-year veteran of the Riverside Police Department -- and setting off a huge manhunt across Southern California.
The police were on high alert in a dragnet that appeared to rattle even a part of the country familiar with sweeping police hunts. Protection teams were dispatched overnight to guard uniformed officers and their families, scores of officers set up lines of defense outside the fortress that is the Los Angeles Police Department headquarters, and motorcycle officers were ordered to retreat to the safety of patrol cars.
In Torrance, two women delivering newspapers were shot and wounded by police officers who mistook the Toyota pickup they were driving for the one identified as belonging to the gunman, a gray Nissan. About 12 hours later in San Diego, squads of police cars, in a blaze of red lights and screeching tires, converged on a motel where the suspect was mistakenly thought to be hiding after his wallet was found on a sidewalk. 
As night fell, the gray Nissan was found, destroyed by flames, at the side of a dirt road in a snowy, wooded area near Big Bear, a ski resort about 100 miles from downtown Los Angeles. The resort and local schools were closed as soon as the vehicle was discovered.
The suspect was identified as Christopher J. Dorner, 33, who worked for the Police Department from 2005 to 2008. Mr. Dorner posted a rambling and threatening note on his Facebook page, which police referred to as ''his manifesto,'' complaining of severe depression and pledging to kill officers to avenge his dismissal for filing a false report accusing a colleague of abuse.
In the note, Mr. Dorner said he had struggled to clear his name in court before resorting to violence.
The 6,000-word manifesto was bristling with anger and explicit threats, naming two dozen police officers he intended to kill. Mr. Dorner laid out grievances against a police department that he said remained riddled with racism and corruption, a reference to a chapter of the department's history that, in the view of many people, was swept aside long ago.
The authorities responded by assigning special security details to protect the people named in the manifesto, and asked the news media not to publish their names.
''I have exhausted all available means at obtaining my name back,'' he wrote. ''I have attempted all legal court efforts within appeals at the Superior Courts and California Appellate courts. This is my last resort. The LAPD has suppressed the truth and it has now lead to deadly consequences.''
''I will bring unconventional and asymmetrical warfare to those in LAPD uniform whether on or off duty,'' he wrote.
The police said that Mr. Dorner was traveling with multiple weapons, including an assault weapon. On his Facebook page, Mr. Dorner posted a certificate from the Department of the Navy attesting that he had completed a course of training to become an antiterrorism officer at the Center for Security Forces.
''Dorner is considered to be armed and extremely dangerous,'' said Chief Charlie Beck of the Los Angeles Police Department. ''He knows what he's doing; we trained him. He was also a member of the armed forces. It is extremely worrisome and scary, especially to the police officers involved.''
Mr. Dorner bragged about his lethal skills. ''You are aware that I have always been the top shot, highest score, an expert in rifle qualification in every unit I have been on,'' he wrote.
The rampage began with a double homicide in Orange County on Sunday. One of the victims, Monica Quan, 28, was the daughter of a former Los Angeles police captain who had defended Mr. Dorner in his disciplinary proceedings.
On Wednesday, Chief Beck said, Mr. Dorner tried to hijack a boat in San Diego. Early Thursday morning, police officers assigned to protect an officer named by Mr. Dorner were alerted by a civilian who spotted a man resembling the suspect. As they followed him, Mr. Dorner opened fire as they approached him -- grazing one in the head -- before he fled, Chief Beck said.
Less than an hour later, the suspect approached two Riverside police officers parked at a traffic light in a patrol car and opened fire, killing one and seriously wounding the second.
''The Riverside officers were cowardly ambushed,'' Chief Beck said. ''They had no opportunity to fight back, no pre-warning.''
At Big Bear, police officials said they were prepared to search through the night, weather permitting: a winter snowstorm was approaching. Sheriff John McMahon of San Bernardino County said that footprints had been found in the show leading from the abandoned vehicle; he would not say where they led.
Sheriff McMahon said that about 125 law enforcement officers were going door-to-door in the area searching for the suspect, looking for signs of forced entry and making certain that residents there were safe.
The authorities were concerned that the gunman would expand his choice of targets. ''This is a vendetta against all Southern California law enforcement, and it should be seen as such,'' Chief Beck said
More than a dozen law enforcement agencies across Southern California -- from Riverside, east of Los Angeles, down to San Diego -- were engaged in the search. Police vehicles crowded the freeways, where electronic signs urged drivers to look out for the suspect's vehicle.
F.B.I. agents staked out a home in Orange County where neighbors said Mr. Dorner's mother lived. Neighbors said that they had seen Mr. Dorner on and off after he returned from a two-year deployment in the Middle East in 2006. They all said he was a cordial and approachable neighbor.
''I don't expect to see him anymore, because I know that this is a hot area for him,'' said Ike Gonzalez, who has lived there since 1973.
Mr. Dorner was dismissed after being charged with making false statements about his training officer, who he alleged had kicked a suspect. A review board ultimately found Mr. Dorner guilty. Mr. Dorner sued the department, but both the trial court and an appellate court upheld his termination.
In his online manifesto, Mr. Dorner railed against the officers involved in his hearing. ''You destroyed my life and name because of your actions,'' he wrote. ''Time is up.''
''I never had the opportunity to have a family of my own, I'm terminating yours,'' he wrote. ''Look your wives/husbands and surviving children directly in the face and tell them the truth as to why your children are dead.''

Suspect in Texas Veteran's Killing Was Hospitalized

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ and KATHRYN JONES; Manny Fernandez reported from Dallas, and Kathryn Jones from Lancaster, Tex.

DALLAS -- Eddie Ray Routh, the former Marine corporal accused of killing Chris Kyle, an author and retired Navy SEAL sniper, had been released from a veterans hospital here four days before the shootings over the objections of his parents, Mr. Routh's court-appointed lawyers said.
Mr. Routh, 25, and his relatives told the police in recent weeks and months that he had been deeply troubled and was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, according to court documents. He had a series of run-ins with the authorities in parts of North Texas, and had threatened to kill himself at least once, police records show. 
Mr. Routh had been undergoing treatment at the Dallas V.A. Medical Center and Green Oaks Hospital, a psychiatric center in Dallas. On Jan. 24, Mr. Routh was released from the Dallas V.A. center but soon returned, and he was again released on Jan. 29, said his lawyers, R. Shay Isham and J. Warren St. John. On both occasions, Mr. Routh's father and mother, Raymond and Jodi Routh, had protested his release, the lawyers said.
''She was begging them not to let him loose,'' Mr. Isham said.
Four days after Mr. Routh's release, Mr. Kyle, 38, and a friend, Chad Littlefield, 35, took Mr. Routh to a rural shooting range to help the young man, one of the ways Mr. Kyle often assisted troubled veterans. For reasons that remain unclear, the authorities said, Mr. Routh turned a semiautomatic handgun on the two men, shooting both multiple times and fleeing in Mr. Kyle's truck before he was captured hours later near his home in the Dallas suburb of Lancaster.
A spokeswoman for the federal Department of Veterans Affairs said that without a signed privacy waiver from Mr. Routh, they could not disclose any protected health information.
Mr. Routh remained in custody at the Erath County Jail in Stephenville on $3 million bond. Mr. Isham said that on Tuesday, Mr. Routh refused to meet with his mother and Mr. St. John, unless he was given a cigarette. ''He's trying to play an angle -- 'I give you something, you give me something,' '' Mr. Isham said. ''He wouldn't see anybody.''
Eleven days after graduating from high school in the nearby town of Midlothian, Mr. Routh began boot camp in June 2006 at age 18. In his senior yearbook, there is a photo of him talking with a recruiter. ''I want to be one of the few and the proud,'' he was quoted as saying, when asked why he was joining the Marines.
Mr. Routh served nearly four years, becoming a corporal shortly before he was discharged in June 2010. He was in Iraq in September 2007, and was part of a disaster-relief deployment to Haiti after the earthquake there in January 2010.
Since then, Mr. Routh appeared to be struggling, and his relatives seemed concerned about his mental state. Eight months before the shootings, Mr. Routh's mother called the Lancaster police in May to report a burglary and appeared to name her son as the suspect. Nine pill bottles were taken, according to the police report. In September, the Lancaster police returned to the house after Mr. Routh threatened to kill himself and had become upset when his father told him he was going to sell his gun.
Court documents suggest that Mr. Routh may have become fixated with Mr. Kyle's black Ford truck, because he told his sister, Laura Blevins, and her husband that he had killed the two men and had ''traded his soul for a new truck.'' But the documents also make clear that Mr. Routh was paranoid. ''He said they were out shooting target practice and he couldn't trust them so he killed them before they could kill him,'' his sister's husband, Gaines Blevins, told the authorities, according to court documents. ''He said he couldn't trust anyone anymore (and) everyone was out to get him.''
After a search of the house, Mr. Routh's cellphone, a box of 9-millimeter ammunition and paraphernalia for smoking marijuana were seized.
The funeral for Mr. Littlefield will be Friday at 2 p.m. at First Baptist Church of Midlothian. A memorial service for Mr. Kyle will be held Monday at 1 p.m. at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, according to his Facebook page.

Venezuelan officials found 106 firearms and more than 8,000 rounds of ammunition inside a prison after a riot last month that killed 58 people, nearly all of them inmates, the country's top prison authority said Thursday. The official, Iris Varela, said the weaponry was discovered at the Uribana prison in the western city of Barquisimeto after officials evacuated and searched it following the Jan. 25 riot. The weapons included revolvers, shotguns, submachine guns and assault rifles used by the military, she said. Ms. Varela said the violence erupted when a small group of inmates began shooting at other prisoners while they were being searched by the authorities.

2 Detectives' Killer Is Eligible for Death Penalty, Judge Rules

BYLINE: By MARC SANTORA

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 24

LENGTH: 542 words

A New York City man who was sentenced to be executed for the murder of two undercover police officers in 2003 -- and who made headlines once again this week after it was revealed he impregnated one of his prison guards -- was found by a judge on Thursday not to be mentally retarded and therefore eligible to be put to death.
The man, Ronell Wilson, shot and killed two undercover detectives -- James V. Nemorin and Rodney J. Andrews -- during a failed gun-buy operation on Staten Island in 2003. A federal jury found Mr. Wilson guilty of murder and handed down the first death sentence by a federal jury in the city in more than half a century. 
An appeals court upheld the conviction but not the death sentence, saying the prosecution unfairly prejudiced the jury during sentencing. That meant the question of whether Mr. Wilson would face capital punishment or would face life in prison would have to be heard by a new jury.
Lawyers for Mr. Wilson sought to block the prospect that he could receive another death sentence by arguing that he was mentally incompetent. But Judge Nicholas G. Garaufis of United States District Court in Brooklyn ruled that Mr. Wilson was not mentally retarded, either at the time he committed the crime or now.
The 55-page ruling did not mention the latest controversy surrounding Mr. Wilson -- that he had a sexual affair with one of his prison guards at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn and that she is now eight months pregnant with his child. The guard, Nancy Gonzalez, 29, was arraigned in federal court on Tuesday on charges of sexual abuse of a person in custody, because an inmate cannot legally consent to sex.
If Mr. Wilson had been found to be retarded, a death penalty ruling would violate the Eighth Amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishments, as well as the Federal Death Penalty Act, passed by Congress in 1988 and amended in 1994. It states that a ''sentence of death shall not be carried out upon a person who is mentally retarded.''
The issue of whether inferior mental capacity should stop someone from being sentenced to death has long been one of the most fraught issues surrounding the death penalty. On June 20, 2002, the Supreme Court issued a landmark ruling ending the execution of those with intellectual disability.
Judge Garaufis noted that over the course of his life, Mr. Wilson had been given nine I.Q. tests. The methods of the testing varied, but Judge Garaufis found that because eight of those tests showed him to be at least three points above the benchmark for legal retardation, which is 70, Mr. Wilson was not retarded.
In addition to the I.Q. tests, Judge Garaufis said he based his ruling on the opinions of the clinicians who administered the tests.
''The clinical judgments of Wilson's test administrators support the court's analysis,'' he wrote. ''And most of them believed his observed scores represented an underestimate of his true intelligence.''
But the judge noted that the ruling did not mean Mr. Wilson would ultimately face execution for his crimes. ''This does not mean that he will receive -- or deserve to receive -- the death penalty,'' he wrote, ''but only that any such penalty would not violate the Federal Death Penalty Act or the Eighth Amendment.''

The Right to Bear Arms

To the Editor:
When the right to bear arms collides with the right not to be killed, why do the guns always win? When rights collide, we usually compromise. After the terrorist attacks of 2001, the right to privacy collided with the right to safety. So we compromised. Now, after multiple gun-related massacres, the right to bear arms is colliding with the right to safety. But the gun extremists won't compromise.
How did the right to bear arms become the one right that never has to budge?

Deeper Divide On Syria Policy Comes to Light

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON and MARK LANDLER

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 1093 words

WASHINGTON -- In his first term, President Obama presided over an administration known for its lack of open dissension on critical foreign policy issues.
But on Thursday, deep divisions over what to do about one of those issues -- the rising violence in Syria -- spilled into public view for the first time in a blunt exchange between Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and the leaders of the Pentagon.
Testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta acknowledged that he and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, had supported a plan last year to arm carefully vetted Syrian rebels. But it was ultimately vetoed by the White House, Mr. Panetta said, although it was developed by David H. Petraeus, the C.I.A. director at the time, and backed by Hillary Rodham Clinton, then the secretary of state. 
''How many more have to die before you recommend military action?'' Mr. McCain asked Mr. Panetta on Thursday, noting that an estimated 60,000 Syrians had been killed in the fighting.
And did the Pentagon, Mr. McCain continued, support the recommendation by Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Petraeus ''that we provide weapons to the resistance in Syria? Did you support that?''
''We did,'' Mr. Panetta said.
''You did support that,'' Mr. McCain said.
''We did,'' General Dempsey added.
Neither Mr. Panetta nor General Dempsey explained why President Obama did not heed their recommendation. But senior American officials have said that the White House was worried about the risks of becoming more deeply involved in the Syria crisis, including the possibility that weapons could fall into the wrong hands. And with Mr. Obama in the middle of a re-election campaign, the White House rebuffed the plan, a decision that Mr. Panetta says he now accepts.
With the exception of General Dempsey, the officials who favored arming the rebels have either left the administration or, as in Mr. Panetta's case, are about to depart. Given that turnover, it is perhaps not surprising that the details of the debate -- an illustration of the degree that foreign policy decisions have been centralized in the White House -- are surfacing only now. A White House spokesman declined to comment on Thursday.
The plan that Mr. Petraeus developed, and that Mrs. Clinton supported, called for vetting rebels and training a cadre of fighters who would be supplied with weapons. The plan would have enlisted the help of a neighboring state.
The proposal offered the potential reward of creating Syrian allies for the United States during the conflict and if President Bashar al-Assad is removed.
Some administration officials expected the issue to be revisited after the election. But when Mr. Petraeus resigned because of an extramarital affair and Mrs. Clinton suffered a concussion, missing weeks of work, the issue was shelved.
Syria rebel leaders have long appealed for weapons. Mohammad Hussein al-Haj Ali, a Syrian major general who defected to the opposition, said in telephone interview last year that he had raised the issue of arming the resistance in a September meeting in Amman, Jordan, with Gen. James N. Mattis, the head of the Central Command, which overseas operations in the Middle East.
''He was very sympathetic to it, but his main concern was who would actually get hold of these weapons,'' he said, referring to General Mattis.
General Haj Ali said he promised that the rebels who were armed would take care not to lose control of the weapons and would return any that they did not use.
General Mattis ''said he would meet the top administration officials within 48 hours and get back to me,'' General Haj Ali said through an interpreter, adding that he still had received no response several weeks later.
The debate over arming the rebels is complex and turns on assessments on the military advantages they might gain, the political calculations on who might come to power in Syria, and the dangers that the arms might fall into the wrong hands.
Jeffrey White, a former senior analyst with the Defense Intelligence Agency and a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said that providing weapons would help the rebels in their fight against a better-equipped government that has warplanes, armor and artillery, and reduce rebel casualties.
Equally important, Mr. White said, it would give the United States influence with groups that would control Syria if Mr. Assad is ousted, and would diminish the influence of extremists.
''The day after the regime falls, the groups that have the guns will dominate the political and military situation,'' Mr. White said. ''And if some of those groups owe that capability to us, that would be a good thing. It does not mean that we would control the situation, but it would give us a means of shaping it.''
Taking a contrary view, Daniel C. Kurtzer, a former United States ambassador to Israel and Egypt, said the potential risks outweighed the gains. Even with thorough vetting, he said, it would be difficult to ensure that the weapons did not end up with unreliable or hostile groups.
''The problem that I think the White House has identified much more clearly than the national security team is, 'Who are you going to deal with?' '' Mr. Kurtzer said.
Much of the lengthy hearing was devoted to sparring over the Pentagon's response to the Sept. 11 attack on the United States diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya. The Pentagon chiefs said the military was not able to respond faster because there was no intelligence of an imminent attack. Mr. McCain faulted the Pentagon for not positioning forces in the region before the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
But the statements by the Pentagon chiefs on Syria were so striking that Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, returned to them after a break in the proceedings.
''Both of you agreed with Petraeus and Clinton that we should start looking at military assistance in Syria, is that correct?'' Senator Graham asked.
''That was our position.'' Mr. Panetta said. ''I do want to say, Senator, that obviously there were a number of factors that were involved here that ultimately led to the president's decision to make it nonlethal.
''And I supported his decision in the end,'' Mr. Panetta continued. ''But my answer to your question is yes.''
Mr. McCain said he was dismayed that Mr. Obama had ''overruled the senior leaders of his own national security team, who were in unanimous agreement that America needs to take greater action to change the military balance of power in Syria.''

A Personal Quest to Make Guns' Toll More Visible

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 16

LENGTH: 771 words

WARWICK, R.I. -- It happened a few minutes before the beginning of Jim Langevin's junior cadet shift back in 1980.
He arrived at the police station here early, as usual. Two officers were standing in the locker room admiring a new .45-caliber semiautomatic pistol. Thinking the chamber was empty, one of them pulled the trigger. A bullet ricocheted off a locker and went right through the boy's neck, severing his spinal cord.
At 16, he would never walk again and never fulfill his dream of becoming a police officer. 
Now, three decades later and seven terms into his career as one of Rhode Island's two members of the House of Representatives, Mr. Langevin, 48, is the only quadriplegic ever to serve in Congress. And his story, unknown to many of those who work with him every day in the Capitol, has thrust him into the raging national debate over gun control.
For the past month, he has been on a quiet campaign to persuade his colleagues to give up their guest passes to next Tuesday's State of the Union address by President Obama so that victims of gun violence can attend.
That way, he said, when the nation's highest officeholders look up from the floor of the House to those watching from the gallery, they will not be able to avoid seeing the human toll that guns can exact.
''It's a powerful reminder to every member of Congress how pervasive this issue is,'' he said the other day as he pulled his electric wheelchair up to a coffee table in his district office. So far he has nearly 20 takers, and many more who are considering the idea.
Mr. Langevin (pronounced LAN-jih-vin), who has boyish looks, a soft voice and an imperturbable demeanor, may not be the highest-profile Democrat pushing for more gun control. And he is not the only House member with a tragic personal history involving a gun.
Those stories abound. Carolyn McCarthy, Democrat of New York, lost her husband in the 1993 Long Island Rail Road rampage that also critically wounded her son. The 20-year-old nephew of Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, was shot to death in his apartment in 2011. Bobby L. Rush, Democrat of Illinois, lost his 29-year-old son to a shooting in 1999.
But like no one else in Congress, Mr. Langevin serves as what he calls ''a visible symbol'' of the danger of weapons.
''I think when I speak about it,'' he said, ''at least it gets them to pause and think. It makes it real, the damage that guns can do.''
Supporters of stricter gun laws say they see a small window of time in which to act. Mindful of how quickly Washington's attention can shift, they say they hope Mr. Langevin serves as a conscience check to politicians who are on the fence.
''Jim's wheelchair is a startling reminder of the danger of a bullet,'' said Representative Keith Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat who is helping to recruit other members to join the State of the Union effort. Mr. Ellison has given his ticket to Sami Rahamim, the son of a man who was among seven people killed in a workplace shooting in Minneapolis in September.
''This effort is a way to resensitize,'' Mr. Ellison added. ''Some of this conversation has been so callous. 'Our rights, our rights, our rights.' Well, what about the suffering of our colleagues?''
Ms. McCarthy has invited the chief of police from Malverne, N.Y., whose uncle James Gorycki was killed in the same shooting that claimed her husband.
Representative David N. Cicilline, Rhode Island's other House member and a Democrat, liked the idea so much that he had to tell his original State of the Union guest, the mayor of Central Falls, R.I., that he was sorry but that the invitation was going to someone else. Cleora Francis-O'Connor, whose son was 17 when he was shot and killed in South Providence, will attend instead.
Representative Elizabeth Esty, a Democrat whose district includes Newtown, Conn., has invited someone closely linked to the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School, where a gunman took the lives of 26 children and school employees in December.
Mr. Langevin's guest will be Jim Tyrell, whose sister was fatally shot in a robbery at a market in Providence.
The special wheelchair Mr. Langevin pilots, which was designed by the same inventor who created the Segway, allows him to raise himself up to about 5 feet tall so he can meet people at closer to eye level, a useful position when your business is politics.
When he makes his case to colleagues on gun issues, his appeal is simple and unemotional. ''My accident happened in what should have been one of the safest places to be: in a police station, at the hands of trained police officers,'' he often says. ''So more guns are not the answer.''

Movies
Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases: nytimes.com/movies.
&#x2605; 'Amour' (PG-13, 2:07) A masterpiece about life, death and everything in between, the latest from the great director Michael Haneke (''The White Ribbon,'' ''Cachי'') takes a long, hard, tender look at an elderly French couple, Georges and Anne -- played by two titans of French cinema, Jean-Louis Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva -- in their final days. Bring hankies. (Manohla Dargis)
&#x2605; 'Anna Karenina' (R, 2:10) Joe Wright's version of the Tolstoy novel, with a script by Tom Stoppard, is wildly, sometimes dizzily theatrical, taking place mostly on a series of elaborate stage sets. The story of Anna (Keira Knightley), her humorless husband (Jude Law) and her lover, Count Vronsky (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) becomes a lush melodrama, counterpointed by the delicate romance of Kitty (Alicia Vikander) and Levin (Domhnall Gleeson). Not a faithful adaptation, by any means, but something better: a bold, lively and ardent reimagining of the book. (A. O. Scott) 
&#x2605; 'Argo' (R, 2:00) A bearded Ben Affleck directed, and stars in, this smart, jittery thriller about a real if stranger-than-fiction chapter of the Iranian hostage crisis that brought together a smart American intelligence officer, some plucky Canadians and two jaundiced Hollywood veterans (the funny tag team of John Goodman and Alan Arkin) to save the day. (Dargis)
&#x2605; 'Barbara' (PG-13; 1:45) Christian Petzold directs this tense, smart film about an East German doctor (Nina Hoss) who, after an unspecified offense, has been banished to the boonies. There, in between hospital rounds and harassment from the secret police, she waits and she burns. (Dargis)
'Broken City' (R, 1:49) The director Allen Hughes's latest tale about power and its abuse in the city revolves around the moral education of a cop (Mark Wahlberg) who shoots a man dead and is forced to turn in his badge. (Dargis)
'Bullet to the Head' (R, 1:31) The veteran action director Walter Hill hasn't done much to enliven this dull story of a collection of bad, badder and baddest men shooting it out, though he has brought a spark of wit to the proceedings, starting with the figure of Sylvester Stallone. (Dargis)
'The Central Park Five' (No rating, 1:59) Directed by Ken Burns, David McMahon and Sarah Burns, this documentary revisits the 1989 rape and beating of the white woman known as the Central Park jogger and the five black and Latino teenagers accused of assaulting her. The five were imprisoned but later exonerated; the filmmakers look back at what happened and why. (Dargis)
&#x2605; 'Chasing Ice' (PG-13, 1:16) The timing couldn't be better for this documentary about the work of James Balog, who set out to provide visual evidence of the effects of global warming by taking time-lapse photographs of melting glaciers. The images are as beautiful as they are important. (Neil Genzlinger)
&#x2605; 'Django Unchained' (R, 2:45) Blaxploitation and spaghetti western meet in the Old South in Quentin Tarantino's latest provocation, with -- literally! -- explosive results. Jamie Foxx is Django, a slave freed by a German bounty hunter (Christoph Waltz), whose partner and protיgי he becomes. After the two kill off a bunch of bad guys, they set off to free Django's wife (Kerry Washington) from captivity at a nightmarish plantation called Candyland. Bloody, farcical and cartoonish, ''Django Unchained'' is at once a wildly entertaining, borderline-irresponsible fantasy and a bold and serious attempt to use the imaginative resources of popular culture to address an old and durable historical injustice. (Scott)
&#x2605; '56 Up' (No rating, 2:24) The latest installment in Michael Apted's remarkable documentary project that has followed a group of Britons since 1964, starting when they were 7, checks in on them at 56. (Dargis)
&#x2605; 'Flight' (R, 2:18) A titanic Denzel Washington plays a veteran commercial pilot whose greatest vocation should be his flying but has instead, for various reasons, become his drinking. Robert Zemeckis directs his finest movie since ''Cast Away.'' (Dargis)
'Gangster Squad' (R, 1:53) This brainless, hopped-up, ultraviolent Los Angeles noir, directed by Ruben Fleischer, assembles an impressive cast (including Sean Penn, Ryan Gosling, Josh Brolin and Emma Stone) and some spiffy period costumes. (Scott)
&#x2605; 'The Gatekeepers' (PG-13, 1:37) Not recommended for anyone clinging to optimism about the Middle East, this documentary, consisting of interviews with six former heads of Shin Bet, the Israeli security agency, is a devastating and informative anatomy of politics, terrorism and the post-1967 collisions between Zionism and Palestinian nationalism. Recommended for anyone who can handle the truth. (Scott)
'Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters' (R, 1:41) It's nice to see something other than a vampire or a zombie on a movie screen, and the witches in this film, directed by Tommy Wirkola, are pretty terrifying. The script, though, could use a bit more wit, and the stars, Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton as the grown-up brother and sister from the fairy tale, could use a bit more chemistry. (Genzlinger)
'Happy People: A Year in the Taiga' (No rating, 1:34, in English and Russian) In ''Happy People: A Year in the Taiga,'' Werner Herzog airdrops us into the vast Siberian taiga (a sprawling region of subarctic forest) for a seasonal portrait focusing on fur trappers. Rather than Mr. Herzog's customary foray into the abyss, this film, culled from a Russian television documentary and given a philosophizing voiceover, is a quaint throwback to the illustrated chronicles of television nature documentaries. (Nicolas Rapold)
'A Haunted House' (R, 1:37) The brand of horror film that features hand-held cameras and found footage probably didn't need spoofing in the first place, but this clumsy movie tries anyway. It fails, because the writers (Marlon Wayans and Rick Alvarez) and the director (Mike Tiddes) are content with sophomoric humor and lazy story about a couple (Mr. Wayans and Essence Atkins) who decide to move in together. A demon moves in too. (Genzlinger)
'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' (PG-13, 2:50) Peter Jackson's adaptation of the J. R. R. Tolkien novel -- the first in a trilogy of films -- is a slick, bloated, lumbering bore, a profit-minded exercise in theme-park-ride cinema that has neither the charm of the book nor the grandeur of Mr. Jackson's ''Lord of the Rings'' movies. (Scott)
&#x2605; 'Holy Motors' (No rating, 1:55, in English and French) The French filmmaker Leos Carax opens the door to a world full of laughter, horror and rapture, reminding you of just how drearily conventional many movies are. A mystery man (Denis Lavant) moves, walks, leaps and rides through Paris in a series of strange adventures in a dream of the movies that looks like a movie of dreams. (Dargis)
'The Impossible' (PG-13; 1:47) A story of survival set against the Asian tsunami of 2004, about a British family (Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts are the parents) vacationing in Thailand when disaster strikes. The performances are excellent (Tom Holland, as the couple's oldest son, is especially strong), and the director, Juan Antonio Bayona, deftly recreates the violence of the killer waves and the desolation they left in their wake. Still, something is troubling about the film's almost complete neglect of the non-Western victims of the tsunami. This is the story of a very bad holiday rather than of a mass catastrophe. (Scott)
'John Dies at the End' (R, 1:40) The title of this crazy-quilt, low-budget genre train wreck is less of a spoiler than you might think. Directed by Don Coscarelli (''Bubba Ho-Tep,'' the ''Phantasm'' movies), it tells the story of Dave (Chase Williamson), a small-town loser who confronts a threat to human existence involving visitors from other planets and dimensions, wayward sex toys and a highly addictive hallucinogenic drug known as soy sauce. (Scott)
'Koch' (No rating, 1:34) Neil Barsky's portrait of Edward I. Koch, the three-term New York mayor (who died on Feb. 1, the day the movie opened), is affectionate but not uncritical. The film moves back and forth between a condensed history of Mr. Koch's time in office and visits with him in the fall of 2010, as he campaigns for various candidates, defends his record and revisits old grudges. A personality this large and complicated may require more than 94 minutes, but this documentary is catnip for the nostalgic and the curious. (Scott)
'Life of Pi' (PG, 2:06) In bringing Yann Martel's beloved novel to the screen, Ang Lee has created a 3-D digital fable that is often stunning to behold. The middle section, in which the title character and a Bengal tiger share a lifeboat after a shipwreck, is touching and clever, but its delicacy is spoiled by a fuzzy, cloying spiritualism that hangs over everything like a humid cloud. (Scott)
&#x2605; 'Lincoln' (PG-13, 2:29) Daniel Day-Lewis plays the Great Emancipator with playful wit as well as gravity. This film, directed by Steven Spielberg from a bristling, discursive script by Tony Kushner, focuses on Lincoln's political skills and confines itself mainly to a single momentous month in his presidency. The superb supporting cast (including Sally Field as Mrs. Lincoln and Tommy Lee Jones as the abolitionist firebrand Thaddeus Stevens) helps turn the movie into a group portrait of leadership in crisis. It's a democratic masterpiece, a history lesson full of historical detail and honest patriotic emotion. (Scott)
'Mama' (PG-13, 1:49) This ghost story starring Jessica Chastain offers a strong sense of time and place, along with the kind of niceties that don't often figure into horror flicks, notably pictorial beauty, an atmosphere throbbing with dread and actors so good that you don't want anyone to take an ax to them. (Dargis)
&#x2605; 'The Master' (R, 2:17) Confounding and amazing, Paul Thomas Anderson's latest film explores the relationship between a cult leader (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and a shellshocked veteran of World War II (Joaquin Phoenix). Must be seen to be believed, and wrestled with for a long time after. (Scott)
'Les Misיrables' (PG-13, 2:37) Tom Hooper (''The King's Speech'') directs this overly busy screen version of the popular musical with Hugh Jackman as the reformed prisoner, Russell Crowe as his tormentor and Anne Hathaway as the prostitute turned martyr. By the grand finale, when tout le monde is waving the French tricolor in victory, you may instead be raising the white flag in exhausted defeat. (Dargis)
'Movie 43' (R, 2:55) The kindest thing to be said about this star-saturated collection of crude one-joke vignettes made with big-time directors is that most of the participants seem to relish being naughty. (Stephen Holden)
'Mumia: Long Distance Revolutionary' (No rating, 2:00) This documentary by Stephen Vittoria revisits yet again the case of Mumia Abu-Jamal, who was convicted of killing a Philadelphia police officer three decades ago and who is viewed as a sort of political prisoner by his supporters. The idea is to highlight the writing Mr. Abu-Jamal has been doing in prison, but the film is more effective as simply a reminder that there are outspoken voices on the left as well as on the far right. The ones here include academics like Cornel West and activists like Angela Davis. (Genzlinger)
'Oscar Nominated Short Films 2013' (no rating; various running times) The strongest short films in three programs -- live action, documentary and animation -- are mini-dramas set in Kabul, Afghanistan (''Buzkashi Boys'') and Somalia (''Asad''). Both view the world through the eyes of preadolescent boys whose vitality and adventurous spirit mitigates the surrounding misery. The subjects of four of this year's five documentary shorts include poverty, homelessness, cancer and heart disease, but none could be described as despairing. The animation is a mixed bag. Throughout, a glass-half-full attitude prevails. (Holden)
'Parental Guidance' (PG, 1:44) Billy Crystal stars as a baseball announcer who, when not being indulged by his wife (Bette Midler), schools his daughter (Marisa Tomei) and grandkids on the right way to do everything. Lisa Addario and Joe Syracuse wrote the script, and Andy Fickman gives it some snap. (Dargis)
'Parker' (R, 1:58) This blunt and bloody tale of underworld revenge -- based on a pseudonymous novel by Donald E. Westlake -- stars Jason Statham as the title character, a brilliant thief with a stony sense of honor. He travels to Palm Beach to collect payback from a gang that ripped him off, and the violence of that undertaking is leavened by the screwball almost-romance that unfolds between him and a local real estate agent played by Jennifer Lopez. Taylor Hackford (''An Officer and a Gentleman,'' ''Ray'') directed, with the unpretentious skill a movie like this requires. (Scott)
'Quartet' (PG-13, 1:38) A chance to watch vintage British actors in mildly naughty, gently touching circumstances. Dustin Hoffman directed this tale of retired musicians -- played by Billy Connolly, Maggie Smith and Tom Courtenay, among others -- settling old scores and singing old songs. (Scott)
'Race 2' (No rating, 2:30, in Hindi) A Bollywood thriller set mostly in Turkey, ''Race 2'' spends a lot of time ogling wealthy lifestyles and two international men of mystery (Saif Ali Khan and John Abraham). There's not much fizz in this movie, whose plot goes on and on. So it comes as no surprise when one character asks ''What happens next in this race?'' The answer is: ''Same thing that happened before.'' (Rachel Saltz)
&#x2605; 'Rust and Bone' (R, 2:00, in French) Jacques Audiard (''A Prophet,'' ''The Beat That My Heart Skipped'') directs this tough and tender melodrama with a ferocious conviction that disguises some of its sentimental soft spots. The Belgian actor Matthias Schoenaerts plays Ali, a sometime prizefighter and unreliable father who befriends Stיphanie (Marion Cotillard), a trainer of killer whales trying to recover after a terrible accident. The romance that blossoms between them is sexy and volatile, as are the performances, which are absolutely convincing even when the story is not. (Scott)
&#x2605; 'Searching for Sugar Man' (PG-13, 1:26) There are several entrancing mysteries circulating in Malik Bendjelloul's hugely appealing documentary about fans, faith and an enigmatic Age of Aquarius musician known as Rodriguez, who burned bright and hopeful before disappearing. Don't wait for the DVD. (Dargis)
&#x2605; 'The Sessions' (R, 1:35) The movie couple of the year, John Hawkes and Helen Hunt -- re-enacting the true story of a disabled, virginal 38-year-old writer and his sexual surrogate -- infuse this film, directed and written by Ben Lewin, with a piercing depth of humanity and no small amount of humor. (Holden)
&#x2605; 'Silver Linings Playbook' (R, 2:00) David O. Russell's exuberant new comedy tracks the feverish, happy, sad, absurdly funny ups and downs of a head case (Bradley Cooper) just as he returns to his parents' home after eight months in a mental institution. When he meets a heartbreak beauty (Jennifer Lawrence), he finds fresh purpose in a movie that honks for happiness. (Dargis)
&#x2605; 'Skyfall' (PG-13, 2:23) Directed by a surprisingly suitable Sam Mendes, this latest Bond is a superior follow-up to ''Casino Royale,'' the 2006 reboot that introduced the excellent Daniel Craig as 007. Playful but never frivolous, it comes off as something of a franchise rethink, partly because it brings in new faces and implies that Bond, like Jason Bourne, needed to be reborn. (Dargis)
&#x2605; 'Sound City' (No rating, 1:46) Dave Grohl of Nirvana and Foo Fighters tries out the director's chair for this enjoyable documentary about a recording studio in California where some pivotal albums were recorded, including Nirvana's ''Nevermind.'' It's a sweet nostalgia trip, but it's also a lament for the time when music was recorded on tape rather than digitally and sounded as if actual humans were playing the instruments. (Genzlinger)
'Tabu' (No rating, 1:58, in Portuguese) The first half of Miguel Gomes's elegant and elusive black-and-white film concerns a middle-aged woman living alone in present-day Lisbon, who is drawn into the life of her elderly neighbor. The second half tells, without dialogue, the story of that neighbor's romantic adventures in the last years of Portuguese colonial rule in Africa. The mood of nostalgia -- for old movies and for old social arrangements -- is beguiling, if also somewhat coy. (Scott)
'This Is 40' (R; 2:14) Pete and Debbie (Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann) play a Los Angeles married couple in Judd Apatow's sloppy, generous and deeply personal new film. Facing the anxieties of approaching middle age and other related worries, they squabble, act out and wonder if they can find true happiness amid the almost unimaginable privilege they enjoy. (Scott)
'Warm Bodies' (PG-13, 1:37) An improbable zombie romance sweetened with appealing performances and buoyed by one of the better cute meets in recent romantic comedy, when the zombie boy, Nicholas Hoult, decides not to eat a live girl, Teresa Palmer. (Dargis)
'Yossi' (No rating, 1:24, in Hebrew) The sequel to the gay love story, ''Yossi and Jagger,'' a landmark of Israeli cinema, begins as a reasonably hardheaded look at profound cultural change but turns into a soft feel-good fantasy of romantic salvation. (Holden)
&#x2605; 'Zero Dark Thirty' (R, 2:37) Kathryn Bigelow's brilliantly directed fictionalized account about the search for Osama bin Laden is a difficult, urgent movie that shows the unspeakable, torture included, and lets us decide if the death of bin Laden was worth the price we paid. Written by Mark Boal, the movie is a seamless weave of truth and drama as well as a wrenchingly sad, soul-shaking story about revenge and its moral costs. See it, fight over it, but don't ignore it. (Dargis)
Film Series
'1933: Hollywood's Naughtiest, Bawdiest Year' (Friday through Thursday; through March 7) The last full year of relatively unbridled Hollywood filmmaking before the Production Code was enforced, 1933 continues to represent the American Cinema that might have been, before the women's clubs and church groups managed to impose their particular values on the industry. As this superbly organized series (by Film Forum's director of repertory programming, Bruce Goldstein) attests, this was not simply a matter of silk lingerie and risquי situations, though those factors abound in several of the opening weekend films, including Roy Del Ruth's ''Employees' Entrance'' (Friday); Mervyn LeRoy's ''Gold Diggers of 1933'' (Saturday); and Ernst Lubitsch's ''Design for Living'' (Sunday). This was also a period in which Hollywood was profoundly engaged with the everyday lives of Americans, to a degree it has never attained since: William Wellman's ''Heroes for Sale'' (Monday), Alfred E. Green's ''Baby Face'' (next Friday) and Wellman's ''Wild Boys of the Road'' (March 4) all attest to a social reality that was painfully familiar to audience members at the time. At the same time, escapism flourished with exotic melodramas like Frank Capra's ''Bitter Tea of General Yen'' (Tuesday) and Rouben Mamoulian's ''Song of Songs'' (Wednesday). Another form of escapism was the nonsense comedy, epitomized by the Marx Brothers in ''Duck Soup'' and W. C. Fields in ''International House'' (both screening on Feb. 17). The series includes 66 films, and cinephiles will want to mark their calendars for the ultra-rare screenings of Mitchell Leisen's first feature, ''Cradle Song,'' on Feb. 21 and Edward L. Cahn's ''Laughter in Hell'' on Feb. 26. Film Forum, 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110, filmforum.org; $12.50. (Dave Kehr)
A Pryor Engagement (Friday through Thursday; through Feb. 21) Richard Pryor's intensely personal, confessional comedy represented a breakthrough in the stand-up humor of the 1970s, though few of the many Hollywood features he made after fame was his do justice to his originality. This BAMcinיmatek program offers the unvarnished Pryor in two classic concert films, Jeff Margolis's ''Richard Pryor: Live in Concert'' (Friday at 2 and 7 p.m.) and Joe Layton's ''Richard Pryor Live on the Sunset Strip'' (Saturday at 4:30 and 9:30 p.m.), as well as some of his better features, including Paul Schrader's 1978 ''Blue Collar'' (Sunday at 2 and 7 p.m.) and the 1986 semi-autobiographical ''Jo Jo Dancer, Your Life Is Calling'' (Feb. 21 at 7:15), directed by Pryor himself. BAM Rose Cinemas, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $13, $9 for matinees. (Kehr)

Suspect in Botched Shooting Bought Gun Legally Despite Mental Illness

BYLINE: By KIM SEVERSON and ROBBIE BROWN; Kim Severson reported from Charleston, and Robbie Brown from Atlanta.

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 10

LENGTH: 640 words

CHARLESTON, S.C. -- The gentle pace of life on the campus of Ashley Hall, South Carolina's only all-girls preparatory school, appeared to be back on Friday. Parents lined up in the shade of the live oaks to pick up their children. A luncheon for alumnae of the school, which was founded in 1909, went on as planned.
Still, police officers patrolled the iron fence that surrounds the school and teachers remained on edge, trying to grasp how a woman with a public history of mental illness had managed to buy a gun a week earlier and amazed that the gun, when pointed at administrators who confronted her in front of the school on Monday, did not fire. 
Alice Boland, 28, who was charged in 2005 with threatening to assassinate President George W. Bush and members of Congress as she waited in line at U.S. Customs, is again charged with plotting a violent attack. On Monday, after pacing in front of the school gates during car pool and visibly swinging a gun, she tried to shoot two faculty members: the director of the high school, Mary Schweers, and an English teacher, Chris Hughes.
The police charged Ms. Boland with attempted murder and unlawful carrying of a firearm. The only thing that stopped her, they said, was that she did not realize the gun was locked.
''We were very fortunate she did not know how to take the lock off, or this could have been a tragedy,'' said Earl Woodham, a spokesman in Charlotte for the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.
The authorities are investigating whether Ms. Boland was required to disclose her history of mental illness when she bought the gun. A small firearms store in Walterboro, 50 miles from Charleston, sold her the Taurus PT-22 pistol on Feb. 1. She filled out a federal background check form and was approved.
She appeared to have bought the gun legally, Mr. Woodham said. Gun buyers nationwide are required to disclose mental illnesses only if they have been committed to an institution or found ''mentally defective'' by a judge, he said.
''Unfortunately, there are a lot of people who are mentally unstable but who would not technically be declared mentally defective,'' he said.
Ms. Boland's 2005 brush with law enforcement came when she became upset with the slow process of getting through Customs in Montreal.
''I am going to kill President Bush with a gun,'' she said, according to federal court papers. ''Just give me a gun. I am going to come back and shoot you all.''
The federal charges were dropped after she pleaded not guilty by reason of mental incompetence.
In an interview on Friday, her parents, who live in nearby Beaufort, said she continued to struggle with mental illness. Ms. Boland is being held on $900,000 bond at a detention center in North Charleston.
Just before noon Friday, as parents waited to pick up their children at the school, the tragedy averted remained the topic of the day. Here in the heart of historic Charleston, at a school that graduated Barbara Bush, the former first lady, and the feminist author Nancy Friday, the threat of gun violence had seemed like a concern for some other city.
Parents were grateful for the quick action by administrators, who used a well-rehearsed emergency plan to secure the campus and stalled Ms. Boland at the gate. Two weeks ago, in response to the Newtown, Conn., massacre, the police met with school officials to rehearse the protocol for a school shooting.
The mayor of Charleston, Joseph P. Riley Jr., said that the incident was a ''wake-up call'' and that he would encourage South Carolina legislators to tighten restrictions on background checks for mental illness.
''If you threaten to kill a president of the United States, so many alarm bells should sound when you go to buy a gun,'' he said. ''We could easily be talking about a homicide or multiple homicide. It's a miracle we're not.''

Because of an editing error, an article on Friday about the hunt for a former Los Angeles police officer who the authorities say went on a murderous rampage aimed at officers and their families misidentified the vehicle involved in the police shooting of two women delivering newspapers. The women were riding in a Toyota, not a Honda. An accompanying picture caption misstated the details of the truck shown. The truck, a Honda, was also fired on by the police, but its occupants were not injured; it was not the vehicle carrying the two women who were shot. The article also misspelled, at several points, the surname of the former officer being sought. As the article correctly noted elsewhere, he is Christopher J. Dorner, not Dornan.

Number of Frisks Fell in '12, Police Data Show

The number of times New York City police officers stopped, questioned and frisked people in 2012 dropped by 22 percent from the previous year, according to statistics the Police Department released on Friday. 
The decrease -- 533,042 in 2012, compared with about 685,000 in 2011 -- came amid mounting criticism from civil-rights advocates who have argued that the practice of stop and frisk unfairly targeted minorities -- the vast majority of whom were released without any charges.
In the first quarter of 2012, the police stopped 203,500 people, an 11 percent increase from the first quarter of 2011, and appeared to be on pace to break the record for stops set that year. After criticism from a federal judge last spring and widening political protests, however, the police instituted new training. In the last three quarters of the year, there were 172,874 fewer stops than during the same period in 2011, a decrease of 34 percent. For the year, the police seized 39 fewer illegal firearms, a decrease of 4 percent.
Paul J. Browne, the department's chief spokesman, attributed the lower numbers to more training and a shift in deployment. For example, fewer officers have been assigned over the past few months to Operation Impact, a program that puts recent graduates of the Police Academy in high-crime neighborhoods with instructions to seek out suspicious behavior, Mr. Browne said.
''Stops declined after increased training and a decline in Impact staffing, but ultimately the number reflects suspicious behavior observed by police officers,'' Mr. Browne said. ''There was a period after the first quarter where staffing of Impact posts, which had been doubled, was lowered to address demand for staffing of regular precinct assignments.''
But civil rights advocates said there were still too many stops.
''These numbers show that the N.Y.P.D. continues to stop, interrogate and humiliate innocent people far too frequently, and that New Yorkers of color continue to bear the brunt of this indignity,'' Donna Lieberman, the New York Civil Liberties Union's executive director, said.
''A gun -- the ostensible reason behind the stop-and-frisk regime -- was found in 0.1 percent of stops,'' she added. ''That is an unbelievably poor yield rate for such an intrusive, wasteful and humiliating police action.''
City Councilman Peter F. Vallone Jr., the Public Safety Committee chairman, said he did not believe the practice was discriminatory.
''Police go where the guns are,'' he said. ''That is what explains who is getting stopped.''
Still, Mr. Vallone said he had concerns about the previously soaring numbers.
''Even I thought that the number of stops had reached an unsustainable level, causing problems not just in the communities but with the morale of the police officers,'' he said. ''But I hope that this dramatic decrease in the fourth quarter is not an overreaction.''

For Some, Shooting Suspect's Charges of Police Racism Resound

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY; Noah Gilbert and Nuran Alteir contributed reporting.

LOS ANGELES -- For the Los Angeles Police Department, the allegations of departmental corruption and racism by a former police officer now accused of a revenge-fueled killing rampage are the words of a delusional man, detached from the reality of the huge improvements the force has undergone over the years.
''These are the rantings of a clearly very sick individual,'' William J. Bratton, a former department commissioner, said Friday. ''It would be a shame if he was able to rally to his cause people who remember the bad old days of the L.A.P.D.'' 
Yet for whatever changes the department has undergone since the days when it was notorious as an outpost of rampant racism and corruption, the accusations by the suspect -- however disjointed and unhinged -- have struck a chord. They are a reminder, many black leaders said, that some problems remain and, no less significant, that memories of abuses and mistreatment remain strong in many parts of this city.
''Our community doesn't need this,'' said the Rev. William D. Smart, the president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference of Southern California. ''We don't need something like this opening old wounds.''
''While there been a lot of improvements, there's still room for improvement,'' he said. ''There is still one segment of our community that historically distrusts the police force.''
Indeed, in posts on Facebook and in interviews, some black residents offered at least a partial endorsement of the sentiments expressed by the suspect, Christopher J. Dorner, in a manifesto posted on his Facebook page, even as they made it clear that they did not condone the violence he is accused of. Mr. Dorner, the subject of a manhunt, claimed that racism was a factor in his dismissal from the department in 2008, and that it was as endemic in the force as ever.
''We look at the police differently from the way you look at the police,'' said Hodari Sababu, 56, a tour guide who has lived in the South Central section of Los Angeles for 40 years. ''In your community, the police is there to protect and serve; in my community, the police are there to harass and to insult and to kill if they get a chance.''
Charles Hutchinson, 72, a tennis coach who lives in Los Angeles, said he believed Mr. Dorner's story that he had witnessed a fellow officer kick a suspect. Mr. Dorner was dismissed on charges that he had falsified that report.
''These things happen all the time,'' he said. ''I truthfully think that he was wronged by the Police Department. I think that senior officer kicked that homeless guy, they do that all the time.''
Yet even as he said that, Mr. Hutchinson was quick to add that the situation had improved markedly from the days when William H. Parker III ran a force notorious for profiling and beatings. And no matter the lingering perceptions, the evidence reflects that change.
As Mr. Bratton noted, polls have increasingly shown the department's image has improved across the board, including among blacks and Latinos. Whites now make up less than one-third of the force, a sharp turnaround from 30 years ago.
''There has been a huge change,'' said Erwin Chemerinsky, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, who wrote a report on departmental abuses, in an e-mail. But, he added, ''It would be naןve and misguided to say that racism in any institution is entirely a thing of the past.''
Charlie Beck, the police chief, said he did not give any credence to the claims Mr. Dorner made about racism in the department.
''You're talking about a homicide suspect who has committed atrocious crimes,'' he said. ''If you want to give any attribution to his ramblings on the Internet, go right ahead. But I do not.''
Mr. Dorner was dismissed on the recommendations of a police board that found he had filed a false report claiming to have witnessed a partner kick a homeless man in the process of an arrest. Mr. Dorner sought without success to have the court overturn his dismissal.
Three witnesses to the arrest said that they had not seen the alleged assault; the father of the homeless person said that his son told him that he had been kicked.
Chief Beck -- and Mr. Bratton, who said he had also reviewed the file -- said he had no doubt that Mr. Dorner's dismissal was appropriate.
''That case was thoroughly adjudicated; it was reviewed at multiple levels,'' the chief said at a news conference. ''In the final analysis, you'll find Dorner's statements to be self-serving, and the statements of someone who is thoroughly unhappy with his lot in life.''
Still, in some black neighborhoods, where the case has been followed extremely closely, there was evidence of skepticism about how Mr. Dorner was treated by the department.
''Black people feel like we've been targets for so long, we've always felt that the L.A.P.D. was corrupt,'' said Kim Pace, 45, a bus driver from Carson. ''So for us, it's like, O.K., they pushed him over the edge.''
Mr. Sababu, the tour guide, said the sight of a police officer kicking a suspect was not uncommon in the history of South Central Los Angeles. ''Here you have an officer that's actually standing up for a citizen and saying, 'That's wrong, why are you kicking that guy in the face?' and for his efforts, he's fired,'' he said.
Mr. Bratton expressed concern at the fallout of Mr. Dorner's statements, suggesting that they might become a rallying cry for the disaffected. ''Just look at the Facebook postings around this issue and some of the crazies that come out of the woodwork who are rallying to this guy's cause,'' he said.
Mr. Smart said there had been significant improvements in the Police Department's standing with minorities over the past decade, even if some problems remained. He expressed concern that the nuances of that situation could be lost.
''While there's been a lot of improvement, there's still a need to make better relations,'' he said. ''Whether or not all these things happened to him or not, this is causing some people -- you can see this on Facebook, on the articles online -- to say, 'I told you so.' ''

More Than Pushing Cookies

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER. 
Twitter: @ronlieber

SECTION: Section B; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; YOUR MONEY; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 1392 words

TUCSON -- When you buy a box of Girl Scout cookies and devour 10 in a single sitting, as untold numbers of people will in the next month, you are propping up a pretty sizable enterprise.
During last year's sales season, scouts sold $785 million worth of Thin Mints, Samoas and all the rest, about 215 million boxes in all. Our collective annual binge may well represent the greatest continuing marketing bonanza an American nonprofit group has ever created.
But for the 1.5 million or so girls who do the selling, it also represents an opportunity. They handle more money than they might have ever seen in one place, build sales skills long before they have their first part-time jobs and earn prizes -- commissions, in effect -- that their parents might not be able to afford or wouldn't buy for them.
Which is how 10-year-old Mary Ruiz managed to stock her small bedroom here with an iPad, laptop and Nintendo DS. Last year, her customers bought 5,007 boxes of cookies. While the national organization does not collect individual rankings, it's doubtful that more than a tiny handful of girls outsold her. 
To her mother, Pilar, who is also her troop leader, this is a source of pride. To other parents, sales season is a source of dread, when work schedules conspire to keep them from chaperoning their children for after-school sales calls while boxes and order forms consume the weekends.
Still, it's hard to imagine a better way for children to learn to pitch, and keep pitching, than this. And so I trailed the younger Ms. Ruiz this week as she politely knocked on the door of a pink house on East 19th Street with a ''No Soliciting'' sign (a friend had tipped her off that it was all right to try), provided reinforcements to University of Arizona freshmen outside Safeway who had already consumed multiple boxes in the preceding days and tried to close another deal in Spanish.
She pulls an oversize wagon stuffed with meticulously organized boxes and nestles an American flag in between. A sign explains what's known in the Girl Scout world as her ''gift of caring.'' For her, it's an effort to persuade customers to donate change from their purchase toward more cookies or to buy extra boxes outright for soldiers abroad and firefighters and police officers nearby. This can work more than half the time, particularly when customers are already expecting just a small amount of change from a $20 bill. Last year, she delivered 504 boxes to local police officers and arranged donations of 192 boxes to soldiers.
This has had particular resonance in the area in the wake of the shooting of Representative Gabrielle Giffords and several others two years ago. At the South Tucson Police Department, where Ms. Ruiz volunteers regularly and brings officers gifts on their birthdays, she has her own mailbox.
All of this hand-to-hand selling takes time. She took just two days off, including weekends, during the six-week selling season last year and put in about 28 hours each week, on average.
In exchange for her efforts, she earned all manner of goodies from her local scouting council. This year, Ms. Ruiz stands to earn a trip to a local water park, a visit to Disneyland, a ''V.I.P. Club'' experience (no parents allowed), a beach bike and another iPad or laptop.
There comes a point at which all of this may begin to seem less like an educational activity and fund-raising mechanism and more like trying to land in the leader's circle for commissioned sales representatives at Pfizer or someplace similar. But Pilar Ruiz believes it does not cross the line.
''She doesn't have a lot of the other things that other kids have unless she's earned them,'' she said. ''And I think she gets much more satisfaction out of that and takes great pride in owning them when she has worked for them.''
Cookie sales don't just benefit the individual girls. Some of the money goes to the local Girl Scout council, which often uses it to provide scholarships for lower-income scouts to attend summer camp. Each troop also retains some money, and Ms. Ruiz's troop, which sold over 12,000 boxes total last year, has retained $13,000 over the years, which it has earmarked for group travel.
While the perks are nice, Pilar Ruiz didn't sign her daughter up for scouting for the travel. As a work-at-home telephone reservations agent for American Airlines, she has free passes for that.
Instead, it's the life skills. ''It's not important that she necessarily sells cookies,'' she said. ''It's simply that she knows how to sell herself. And by learning to sell cookies as a young girl, she's learned the skill to sell you just about anything.''
Mary Ruiz was once quite shy and is still prone to occasional bouts of nervousness, ringing doorbells and then tapping out a few steps that she's picked up in her baile folklorico dance classes. ''When I first started selling cookies, I was kind of scared to talk to people I didn't know,'' she said. ''You just get warmed up to it.''
This sort of thing warms the heart of Daniel H. Pink, whose new book, ''To Sell Is Human'' was an instant best-seller when it came out last month. ''Quieter kids can get a little bit more comfortable with asking for stuff,'' he said. ''And the more voluble and extroverted can learn to listen.''
Mr. Pink, a former colleague of mine at Fast Company magazine, first realized he had a bright future in sales while going door-to-door in the commercial district of his town peddling ads for his high school newspaper, The Bexley Torch. ''If you've created something you truly believe in, then your obligation is to bring it to other people,'' he said. ''There's nothing seamy about it.''
Besides the age-old question about whether the Girl Scouts should rely so heavily on pushing mini sugar bombs, there is an inevitable one about overaggressive stage parenting. After all, there are strict rules about the number of adults who must be present when scouts are selling at booths or door to door. Just how much are they helping anyway?
Pilar Ruiz isn't crazy about all of the time that parents need to put in either. ''It was a logistical nightmare,'' she said. Still, last year she managed to get enough paid time off to spend many hours with Mary as she dragged her wagon around town.
This wasn't the first year either, and people have noticed. ''When she was little, some of the other adults in Girl Scouts actually sat me down, and they were worried about the kids in my troop, particularly Mary, because they thought she was working too much,'' she said. ''I guess my parenting skills were questioned.''
Ms. Ruiz said that she did push her daughter to do her best, the same way she did in any activity and the same way any other parent would for a bright child. ''I want her to have, which I believe she's acquired, good work ethics, good values and to really understand that if you want something in this life, you have to work for it,'' she said. ''I don't want her to be one of those kids that spends 20 hours a week playing video games and saying, 'Give me, give me, give me.''' Mary's father died last year.
According to Mary, whom I interviewed before her mother uttered the words above, no more than a gentle shove to get some momentum going was necessary anyway. ''I have a goal,'' she said. ''I do not not reach my goals, because I'm a perfectionist. It makes me feel happy.''
For any parent, the oversight in this kind of situation is a tricky line to walk. We want to push our children, while making sure that any activity remains theirs, but it's always tempting to go past the point where the activity starts to become yours, too. And because they're your offspring, in some ways the project is always a little bit yours, isn't it?
As Mary Ruiz has become more tuned in to the world of commerce and money, she's now rooting around in her mother's financial affairs. Over the menudo course at a restaurant Thursday night, in the midst of a discussion about travel, Mary had many highly specific questions about exactly what a timeshare is.
Her mother has been on the receiving end of this heightened curiosity about how the world of personal finance works for a while now, including questions about their mortgage and various forms of insurance.
''I know I didn't get those kinds of questions from my older daughter,'' she said. ''But she didn't participate in Girl Scouts the way that Mary does.''

Cold Trail and Blizzard Hamper Search for Ex-Officer in California Killings

BYLINE: By IAN LOVETT

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 12

LENGTH: 476 words

BIG BEAR LAKE, Calif. -- The search for the former Los Angeles police officer wanted in three killings continued throughout Friday here, even as a blizzard covered the mountains with a foot of snow. But as no new traces of the suspect were found, the authorities wondered if he had somehow slipped through their fingers. 
Law enforcement agencies from across Southern California had been on a regionwide manhunt since early Thursday for Christopher J. Dorner, 33, a former Navy reservist sought in connection with the shooting deaths of three people and the attempted shootings of several police officials.
Over the course of the week, since the first killing on Sunday, Mr. Dorner had been spotted all over Southern California, from Riverside to San Diego. His trail seemed to lead here on Thursday when a burned-out pickup truck found at the base of the mountain was identified as belonging to Mr. Dorner. Law enforcement followed tracks from the car into the nearby woods. With only a few routes in and out of town, they were confident they had Mr. Dorner cornered.
More than 100 law enforcement officers have spent the last two days combing the area, going door to door overnight, taking special care to investigate remote cabins and other vacation homes whose owners were away, and scanning the area by helicopter.
But they have been unable to turn up any new clues, Sheriff John McMahon of San Bernardino County, said at a news conference on Friday.
''We searched all night; we did not discover any additional evidence,'' Sheriff McMahon said on Friday morning. ''We will continue searching until either we discover that he left the mountain, or we find him.''
''We don't have any evidence to suggest that he is or is not here,'' he added.
For the second day in a row, local schools were closed, keeping schoolchildren and their yellow buses off the mountain roads in the midst of the search.
Still, as the search continued without new evidence, and the ski resort reopened, life in the town began to return to normal. Skiers and snowboarders flocked to the mountain to take advantage of the fresh powder. And both local residents and visitors expressed growing skepticism that Mr. Dorner was -- or ever had been -- in town. Instead, many thought the pickup truck was a diversion.
Cindy Johnston was in the Big Bear Lake area, about 100 miles east of Los Angeles, to ski with her family. ''We're being a little bit more careful, but that's about it,'' Ms. Johnston said. ''We're keeping the kids closer together and not going out so much at night. I think he'd be stupid if he was here, and he doesn't seem stupid. There are too many people looking for him.''
Yvette Blunt, a Big Bear Lake resident, did not think Mr. Dorner was in town anymore, either.
''He left the car here to attract everyone here,'' Ms. Blunt, 66, said. ''That way, he can go somewhere else.''

Seizure of Antiaircraft Missiles in Yemen Raises Fears That Iran Is Arming Rebels There

BYLINE: By C. J. CHIVERS and ROBERT F. WORTH; C. J. Chivers reported from the United States and Robert F. Worth from Washington.

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 5

LENGTH: 672 words

Photographs recently released by the Yemeni government suggest that an interdiction last month by the United States Navy and Yemen's security forces seized a class of shoulder-fired antiaircraft missiles not publicly known to have been out of state control.
Such missiles, in the hands of militants, would pose new threats to military and commercial aviation and would mark an escalation in illegal arms trafficking in the Arabian Peninsula. Yemen has asserted that the missiles were bound for rebels in the country's northwestern frontier, and both the United States and Yemen have suggested that the shipment may have come from Iran. 
The missiles were displayed this week to journalists in Yemen, along with other weapons and military equipment that the Yemeni authorities said had been seized from the Jeehan 1, a dhow that was boarded at sea on Jan. 23.
The photographs and accompanying video images are grainy, but they show either modern Chinese- or Iranian-made heat-seeking missiles in their standard packaging. The weapons are of a class known as Manpads, for man-portable air-defense systems, of which the best known example is the American-made Stinger.
Matthew Schroeder, an analyst who follows missile proliferation for the Federation of American Scientists in Washington and the Small Arms Survey in Geneva, said that while a definitive identification was not yet possible from the information released, the missiles appeared to be either QW-1M missiles from China or Misagh-2 missiles from Iran.
''If these missiles are indeed one of these systems and were bound for an armed group, this is a significant development,'' he said.
Many questions remain about the seizure, which Yemen said also included small arms ammunition, ground-to-ground rockets, explosives, military-grade binoculars and more.
Neither Yemen nor the United States has fully described the boarding of the dhow, including how it was detected or the precise roles of the security services and vessels that were involved. The dhow's shipping documents, if they exist, have also not been made public, nor has any information obtained from the vessel's navigation devices, logbooks or charts.
The seizure follows past joint operations by Yemen and the United States, including American Navy Tomahawk missile strikes against reputed Al Qaeda encampments in 2009 about which the governments issued false or misleading statements.
Investigations by members of the Yemeni Parliament and by Amnesty International later found that in one of those attacks, many civilians had been killed by American-made BLU-97 cluster munitions. The United States has not taken responsibility for the deaths or fully acknowledged its role, raising questions about the Pentagon's honesty and transparency regarding its security collaboration with Yemen.
The antiaircraft missiles, as shown, included missile tubes and battery units, but not the trigger assemblies, known as grip stocks, necessary to fire the weapons.
The Yemeni authorities said they believed the missiles were destined for the rebels, known as the Huthis, who control a de facto statelet in northwestern Yemen, along the Saudi border. They also have a growing following, and are widely viewed as a threat to Yemen's efforts to build a more unified nation after the uprising and political crisis of 2011.
The Huthis fought an intermittent guerrilla war against the Yemeni government from 2004 to 2010, gaining combat experience and building up supplies, including munitions obtained from Yemen's corrupt military. They also briefly fought the Saudi military. Yemen has a vast supply of unregulated weapons and is a hub of regional arms trading.
The Huthis are Zaydis, followers of a variant of Shiite Islam, and they make up about a quarter of Yemen's population. That sectarian affiliation -- however distant -- with Iran's mainstream Shiite population has been the basis for repeated accusations of Iranian influence over the Huthis. Iran's support appears to be ideological rather than military, and its extent is unclear.

Gunmen Kill Nigerian Polio Vaccine Workers in Echo of Pakistan Attacks

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.; Aminu Abubakar contributed reported from Kano, Nigeria.

At least nine polio immunization workers were shot to death in northern Nigeria on Friday by gunmen who attacked two clinics, officials said.
The killings, with eerie echoes of attacks that killed nine female polio workers in Pakistan in December, represented another serious setback for the global effort to eradicate polio.
Most of the victims were women and were shot in the back of the head, local reports said. 
A four-day vaccination drive had just ended in Kano State, where the killings took place, and the vaccinators were in a ''mop-up'' phase, looking for children who had been missed, said Sarah Crowe, a spokeswoman for the United Nations Children's Fund, one of the agencies running the eradication campaign.
Dr. Mohammad Ali Pate, Nigeria's minister of state for health, said in a telephone interview that it was not entirely clear whether the gunmen were specifically targeting polio workers or just attacking the health centers where vaccinators happened to be gathering early in the morning. ''Health workers are soft targets,'' he said.
No one immediately took responsibility, but suspicion fell on Boko Haram, a militant Islamist group that has attacked police stations, government offices and even a religious leader's convoy.
Polio, which once paralyzed millions of children, is now down to fewer than 1,000 known cases around the world, and is endemic in only three countries: Nigeria, Pakistan and Afghanistan.
Since September -- when a new polio operations center was opened in the capital and Nigeria's president, Goodluck Jonathan, appointed a special adviser for polio -- the country had been improving, said Dr. Bruce Aylward, chief of polio eradication for the World Health Organization. There have been no new cases since Dec. 3.
While vaccinators have not previously been killed in the country, there is a long history of Nigerian Muslims shunning the vaccine.
Ten years ago, immunization was suspended for 11 months as local governors waited for local scientists to investigate rumors that it caused AIDS or was a Western plot to sterilize Muslim girls. That hiatus let cases spread across Africa. The Nigerian strain of the virus even reached Saudi Arabia when a Nigerian child living in hills outside Mecca was paralyzed.
Heidi Larson, an anthropologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine who tracks vaccine issues, said the newest killings ''are kind of mimicking what's going on in Pakistan, and I feel it's very much prompted by that.''
In a roundabout way, the C.I.A. has been blamed for the Pakistan killings. In its effort to track Osama bin Laden, the agency paid a Pakistani doctor to seek entry to Bin Laden's compound on the pretext of vaccinating the children -- presumably to get DNA samples as evidence that it was the right family. That enraged some Taliban factions in Pakistan, which outlawed vaccination in their areas and threatened vaccinators.
Nigerian police officials said the first shootings were of eight workers early in the morning at a clinic in the Tarauni neighborhood of Kano, the state capital; two or three died. A survivor said the two gunmen then set fire to a curtain, locked the doors and left.
''We summoned our courage and broke the door because we realized they wanted to burn us alive,'' the survivor said from her bed at Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital.
About an hour later, six men on three-wheeled motorcycles stormed a clinic in the Haye neighborhood, a few miles away. They killed seven women waiting to collect vaccine.
Ten years ago, Dr. Larson said, she joined a door-to-door vaccination drive in northern Nigeria as a Unicef communications officer, ''and even then we were trying to calm rumors that the C.I.A. was involved,'' she said. The Iraq and Afghanistan wars had convinced poor Muslims in many countries that Americans hated them, and some believed the American-made vaccine was a plot by Western drug companies and intelligence agencies.
Since the vaccine ruse in Pakistan, she said, ''Frankly, now, I can't go to them and say, 'The C.I.A. isn't involved.' ''
Dr. Pate said the attack would not stop the newly reinvigorated eradication drive, adding, ''This isn't going to deter us from getting everyone vaccinated to save the lives of our children.''

With Knicks Down by 11, Anthony Takes Over

BYLINE: By PAT BORZI

MINNEAPOLIS -- The Knicks spent much of Friday night's game with the Minnesota Timberwolves struggling to defend the same high pick-and-rolls that had proved so troublesome lately.
In the final minutes, they turned to Carmelo Anthony to rescue them, even though that rendered their half-court offense stagnant. Anthony hit just enough shots, and the Timberwolves missed just enough of the type they had been making, to send the Knicks back to their hotel with a 100-94 victory.
Anthony scored 12 of his 36 points in the final eight minutes as the Knicks overcame an 11-point Minnesota lead. His running one-hander with 2 minutes 37 seconds to play, after Jason Kidd had harassed Ricky Rubio into a wild driving miss, put the Knicks ahead by 91-90. 
The Knicks led, 95-94, when Minnesota's defense forced a 24-second violation with 31.8 seconds left. Timberwolves guard Luke Ridnour drove the lane, but Tyson Chandler, who had had a quiet night to that point, blocked the shot. Kidd grabbed the rebound and fed J. R. Smith, who made the layup, drew the foul and hit one foul shot for a 98-94 lead with 19 seconds left.
Chandler then blocked a Rubio layup, and Raymond Felton wrapped things up with two foul shots.
Smith finished with 15 points off the bench for the Knicks. Rubio, still working his way back from left knee surgery, had 18 points and 11 assists for Minnesota while Ridnour scored 20 -- none in the fourth quarter.
The game came down to the fourth quarter because the Knicks could not contain Ridnour and center Nikola Pekovic in the third. Pekovic scored 7 of Minnesota's 11 consecutive points early in the quarter that wiped out a 9-point Knicks lead, and Ridnour was 5 for 5 from the field and added two foul shots as Minnesota took a 76-70 lead into the fourth. At one point Ridnour grabbed an offensive rebound to the right of the basket, dribbled to the other side and scored without a Knick contesting the shot.
Defense had been a topic of Knicks Coach Mike Woodson's at Friday morning's shootaround, specifically high pick-and-roll defense, which failed the Knicks down the stretch in Wednesday night's 106-96 loss at Washington.
''I'm not going to sit and make any excuses and say we've got one guy who can guard a point guard and guard the ball,'' Woodson said. ''I told these guys the other night -- the perimeters are supposed to guard their guys, and the bigs are supposed to guard their guys.
''Sometimes during the course of the game, it flip-flops because of transition, not getting back matched or a guy getting smacked on a pick-and-roll where you just have to switch. That's the what-if. We've had too many what-ifs as of late. We've got to get away from that.''
Minnesota Coach Rick Adelman's offense functions off high pick-and-rolls, and the Knicks struggled to stop it. The Timberwolves repeatedly challenged the Knicks inside in the first half, scoring 24 of 45 points in the paint. Twice in the second quarter Minnesota converted inbounds passes from Rubio under its basket for scores.
It was 38-38 when Timberwolves guard J. J. Barea injured his left foot on a second-quarter drive -- he let out a yell that could be heard throughout the area -- and headed to the locker room. The Knicks finished the half on a 14-7 run, with Anthony contributing a 3-pointer and a layup, to lead 52-45 at the half. Barea returned to the game in the third quarter.
REBOUNDS
James White, named to the Slam Dunk Contest roster for All-Star weekend, said he would not plan out or practice any dunks in advance. ''I'll just base my stuff on what everybody else does,'' he said. ''If I need to do something, I'll just do it.'' ... Steve Novak will try to become the first Knick to win the 3-point shooting contest. Novak led the N.B.A. in 3-point shooting percentage last year and ranked third heading into Friday at 44.4 percent. ''It's such a different environment,'' he said. ''Shooting off the racks, having the music blasting, things like that. I don't think there is too much you can do to prepare for it. You just have to go out and make shots.''

Not Always Fun and Games

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY and MATT RICHTEL

SECTION: Section ST; Column 0; Style Desk; CULTURAL STUDIES; Pg. 8

Walk into Walmart and you can usually find it: an aisle of weaponry, with names like the Firestrike, Rampage and Hail-Fire, advertising quick firing, ammunition clips and ''semi-auto'' capability. ''Build your arsenal!'' read the box for one, sitting next to a ''tactical vest'' meant to repel barrages of ... foam darts.
Those products, you see, are not actual guns but ''blasters'' made by Nerf, a brand of Hasbro and meant for children ages 8 and up. But in light of the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School, such toys -- and their seemingly quasi-militaristic marketing -- have some parents mulling what to say when their children reach for the toy holster.
''I have no idea what I'm going to do when he asks for one,'' said Brooke Berman, a New York writer with a 2-year-old boy. 
''My initial impulse is to say: 'No. We don't play with guns. They're not toys.' But then, the fact is, they are toys.''
For its part, Hasbro agrees, and says its Nerf products, which can shoot darts, discs and water, simply ''foster active play.''
''We feel that kids of all ages and parents understand that these are toys,'' said John Frascotti, the chief marketing officer for Hasbro, adding that ''parents actually want play that gets their kids off the couch,'' especially indoors, where foam ammo is less likely to break the family china.
Still, Ms. Berman is not alone in questioning whether make-believe guns belong in the toy chest. Heather Whaley, the mother of a 10-year-old boy and an 8-year-old girl, who lives about 10 miles from Newtown, Conn., said the killings there in December have reinforced a deep concern about the accessibility of real weapons in society and in people's homes.
As for the pretend ones, Ms. Whaley said she would not even allow water guns in the house when her children were younger. ''It's dangerous to separate guns from what they actually do, which is kill things,'' she said, adding: ''If a child has grown up comfortable around guns, and has experienced picking up a gun and shooting it, then they will have that muscle memory. And it will be easier for them to shoot a real gun, if they find one.''
That argument has been echoed by a handful of anti-toy-gun activists, including the Alliance for Survival, a grass-roots group in California, which started a program this year to give merit awards to children who pledge not to have toy guns. Others have encouraged ''toy gun exchanges,'' where other playthings like Hula Hoops are given to children who turn in a toy gun.
Jerry Rubin, a peace activist and coordinator of the Alliance for Survival, said their message was that toy guns promote violence. ''No one is saying that if you play with a toy gun, you're going to grow up to be a violent killer,'' Mr. Rubin said. ''But the game is still the same: pretend to kill your friends, pretend to kill your classmates.''
He added that such toys could also endanger children carrying them because they could be mistaken for the real thing, particularly with law enforcement on guard against mass shootings. And indeed, last month the police locked down a high school in Elmont, N.Y., after a student brought a Nerf gun to school, even though it was lime green and bright yellow.
Complicating the debate is the fact that psychologists say it is difficult to assess the impact toy guns or even violent games may have on children's minds, particularly young boys. Jess P. Shatkin, vice chairman for education at the New York University Child Study Center, said that ''boys are in some real way engineered for physical activity and aggression'' at a neurobiological level. ''Just watch kids in the playground,'' he said. ''The boys are very often chasing, jumping, wrestling, pushing, etc.''
Still, Mr. Shatkin (who has a 12-year-old boy) added that he was not sure taking away the Nerf gun would curb violent play, advising instead that parents use ''moderation and supervision.''
''I don't think withholding a toy gun from a child is necessarily the answer,'' he said. ''It's one possible answer. But they are still going to want to make guns from sticks and slices of cheese and anything else they can hold in their hands.''
Stevanne Auerbach, the founder and former director of the San Francisco International Toy Museum, who has organized ''toy gun exchanges,'' said she did not mind boys mimicking guns, if the play is based on their own invention -- see finger, stick, cheese -- rather than on the provision of actual physical (or virtual) toy guns.
But she added that parents are fooling themselves when they buy more cartoonish-looking guns like Nerf blasters, which are brightly colored and often oversize.
''They think it's innocuous because it's a cartoon,'' she said. ''But they're buying something that is reinforcing shooting.''
Other parents question the notion that toy guns are somehow going to poison their children's minds. Kate Moira Ryan, a playwright in New York and mother of a 13-year-old boy, Timothy, said she had forced him to sell his violent shooting video games after Newtown (''Life is too cheap in those games,'' she said) but was less concerned about toy guns.
''Playing with a plastic Nerf gun didn't turn Timothy into a violent person any more than me playing with a cap gun turned me into a mass murderer,'' she said.
For his part, Mr. Frascotti of Hasbro said that the events in Connecticut had given him pause as a parent; he has four children, after all. But he added that he believed that the Nerf blasters, which have been around for 20 years, simply provided ''fun play opportunities for kids.''
''I look at everything first and foremost as a parent,'' he said. ''And we believe that parents are the best ones to make decisions about what toys their children should play with.''
Shannon Watts, a stay-at-home mother from a suburb of Indianapolis, said she knows all about rambunctious children. Her 12-year-old son, Sam, has always been a fan of roughhousing and play battles. But she said she is always careful to explain to him and his friends why guns should not be part of it.
''You guys can play and wrestle and play fantasy, but part of that should not be to kill each other and pretending to end someone's life,'' Ms. Watts said.
Since Sandy Hook, Ms. Watts said, she has taken a big step in that regard, starting an organization called One Million Moms for Gun Control, for which she said tens of thousands of parents have signed up.
And while Sam enjoys playing with toy guns at friends' homes, Ms. Watts does not allow them in hers.
''I don't want him to act out something very dark,'' she said.

Have Banter, Will Travel

BYLINE: By BEE-SHYUAN CHANG

In 2005, after meeting on the set of ''Mr. and Mrs. Smith,'' Timothy White and Brad Pitt went on a five-day motorcycle ride in the Mojave Desert. The adventure was partly for fun (both love bikes) and partly for work (Mr. White took along a stylist, racks of clothes and two assistants, who followed in a Winnebago for a photo shoot).
But on the first evening, things went awry. ''We had another 80 miles to go and it's pitch black,'' Mr. White recalled the other day at his Midtown studio. ''All I'm seeing is headlights and then I'm seeing the front end of his bike wobble. He wiped out. I pulled over and I was freaking out.
''Like, I just killed Brad Pitt.'' 
Of course, that didn't happen. Mr. Pitt went on to become Mr. Angelina Jolie and make perfume commercials. And after the actor checked out of a Las Vegas hospital with minor scrapes, the motorcycle trip resumed and netted several memorable images: Mr. Pitt channeling James Dean at a dusty gas station; Mr. Pitt hanging at the Chicken Ranch, a legal brothel in Nevada; Mr. Pitt in bed, looking vulnerable yet coy at a roadside motel.
It would not be the first, nor last time, that Mr. White palled his way to snapping A-list celebrities of the sort Ryan Seacrest might chase down a red carpet. In a career that spans three decades, Mr. White has photographed Harrison Ford, Sophia Loren, Audrey Hepburn, Paul McCartney, Axl Rose, Whitney Houston, Nicolas Cage, Whoopi Goldberg, Yoko Ono, Elizabeth Taylor and oodles more for Rolling Stone, Vanity Fair and other magazines.
''The lifestyle, it's all kind of rock 'n' roll,'' said Mr. White, 57, as he reclined on a dark leather sofa in his immaculate five-story carriage house on West 54th Street, where he lives and works. His jet-set work schedule (flights to Australia and Russia on a client's whim, he said) has made him particularly chummy with the grizzled rocker-cum-biker set.
Yet, despite dizzying success, Mr. White seems restless. He partnered with the Morisson Hotel Gallery, a fine arts photography gallery, to open a new outpost at the Sunset Marquis in Los Angeles, just in time for this weekend's Grammys. He's also pitching a reality show on car restoration.
Not that he's given up his bread and butter. On the second floor, two assistants were touching up his photographs of Kim and Kourtney Kardashian for an E! network promo. On the ground floor, a custom chopper built by Indian Larry stands by the door, near a silver Aston Martin.
Dressed in a black long-sleeve crew neck, jeans and beat-up boots, Mr. White was as slim and poised as any of his famous subjects (he runs and practices Iyengar yoga with a private instructor). He speaks in constant but smooth streams of sentences, and likes to direct the conversation, a manner likely honed from keeping actors and rock stars focused on long photo shoots.
He called his job a psychological one of sorts, but when pressed, he added: ''It's more really a manipulator. I mean it's not exploitative, but it's definitely manipulative.'' To get the photo, he tries to ''lead them and mold them,'' but without ''prying too much.''
''That's all anybody does to them,'' he said of his celebrity subjects. ''So I talk about things to disarm them, because no matter what, their guard is up. That's the nature of a photo shoot. I can talk motorcycles. I can talk a little bit of ballet. I talk about me.''
He might, for example, joke about the suburbs. Mr. White grew up in Fort Lee, N.J., the youngest of three in a middle-class family. His father was a financial controller for the Coast Guard, stationed on Governors Island, and his mother was a housewife. His two older sisters were big Beatles fans, and once took him to a concert when he was 9.
As a ''young delinquent,'' he said jokingly, he made New York his teenage playground. After high school, he enrolled at the University of Arizona to study landscape architecture, but didn't take to the party atmosphere. He transferred to the Rhode Island School of Design, where he studied photography.
In 1979, upon graduating, he moved back to New York, renting a ramshackle Chelsea loft with two friends, and hustled for jobs. To pay rent, he photographed aspiring models for various modeling agencies and schools, often as many as 50 to 75 young women a day -- an intense pace that he said taught him to maintain a steady banter ''to keep people working, distracted, engaged.''
He attributes his rise to pluck and people skills. An early gig in 1988 involved shooting Harrison Ford in Jackson Hole, Wyo. ''He's a real grump,'' Mr. White said, chuckling. But after their first day on the shoot, they bonded by taking a walk through the woods, while smoking a joint together, Mr. White said.
They hit it off, and over the years, they've been up to other boyish shenanigans, like zigzagging the country in Mr. Ford's biplane and helicopter, and riding along Route 66 on their motorcycles. ''Harrison's become a true friend,'' Mr. White said, before adding, ''Truthfully, he's helped my career.''
By the late '80s, the photographer had worked his way to more magazine assignments, and particularly, a plum cover contract with Rolling Stone, for which he once shot Bon Jovi dressed all in black with a white horse rearing up as backdrop.
''It was a major thing at the time: it was a real horse in the studio in London,'' he said. ''Nowadays, it doesn't mean anything. You could just do a photo composite.''
Another bold shoot he recalled involved setting Eddie Van Halen's hand on fire. That wouldn't happen now, he said, because young stars, whether they be Robert Pattinson or Jennifer Hudson, won't go to the same lengths for a photo.
''We're inundated with images,'' he added. ''We just look at it and delete it. I know I sound old, but we really studied imagery.''
Age is catching up with him in other ways. His mother and father are both 93 and he recently separated from his wife. He finds himself reflecting on his career more often.
''It's lucrative and all of that, but it's hard to share with people,'' he said. ''Like there's the extravagance of it all. Lunch alone on a shoot could cost $25,000 because somebody wanted sushi flown in. Unless you're in the business or have a sense of the business, no one really gets what I do.''
So in addition to his decadent celebrity shoots and more movie posters (his next projects include ''Paranoia'' and ''Ender's Game,'' both starring Mr. Ford), he is embarking on something personal: a photo book about his parents, documenting history, aging and inevitable loss.
''They're the subjects: the security and support that I've had my whole life,'' he said. ''But I'm looking through them to see myself.''

Relax! You'll Be More Productive

BYLINE: By TONY SCHWARTZ. 
The chief executive officer of The Energy Project and the author, most recently, of ''Be Excellent at Anything.''

SECTION: Section SR; Column 0; Sunday Review Desk; OPINION; Pg. 1

THINK for a moment about your typical workday. Do you wake up tired? Check your e-mail before you get out of bed? Skip breakfast or grab something on the run that's not particularly nutritious? Rarely get away from your desk for lunch? Run from meeting to meeting with no time in between? Find it nearly impossible to keep up with the volume of e-mail you receive? Leave work later than you'd like, and still feel compelled to check e-mail in the evenings?
More and more of us find ourselves unable to juggle overwhelming demands and maintain a seemingly unsustainable pace. Paradoxically, the best way to get more done may be to spend more time doing less. A new and growing body of multidisciplinary research shows that strategic renewal -- including daytime workouts, short afternoon naps, longer sleep hours, more time away from the office and longer, more frequent vacations -- boosts productivity, job performance and, of course, health.
''More, bigger, faster.'' This, the ethos of the market economies since the Industrial Revolution, is grounded in a mythical and misguided assumption -- that our resources are infinite. 
Time is the resource on which we've relied to get more accomplished. When there's more to do, we invest more hours. But time is finite, and many of us feel we're running out, that we're investing as many hours as we can while trying to retain some semblance of a life outside work.
Although many of us can't increase the working hours in the day, we can measurably increase our energy. Science supplies a useful way to understand the forces at play here. Physicists understand energy as the capacity to do work. Like time, energy is finite; but unlike time, it is renewable. Taking more time off is counterintuitive for most of us. The idea is also at odds with the prevailing work ethic in most companies, where downtime is typically viewed as time wasted. More than one-third of employees, for example, eat lunch at their desks on a regular basis. More than 50 percent assume they'll work during their vacations.
In most workplaces, rewards still accrue to those who push the hardest and most continuously over time. But that doesn't mean they're the most productive.
Spending more hours at work often leads to less time for sleep and insufficient sleep takes a substantial toll on performance. In a study of nearly 400 employees, published last year, researchers found that sleeping too little -- defined as less than six hours each night -- was one of the best predictors of on-the-job burn-out. A recent Harvard study estimated that sleep deprivation costs American companies $63.2 billion a year in lost productivity.
The Stanford researcher Cheri D. Mah found that when she got male basketball players to sleep 10 hours a night, their performances in practice dramatically improved: free-throw and three-point shooting each increased by an average of 9 percent.
Daytime naps have a similar effect on performance. When night shift air traffic controllers were given 40 minutes to nap -- and slept an average of 19 minutes -- they performed much better on tests that measured vigilance and reaction time.
Longer naps have an even more profound impact than shorter ones. Sara C. Mednick, a sleep researcher at the University of California, Riverside, found that a 60- to 90-minute nap improved memory test results as fully as did eight hours of sleep.
MORE vacations are similarly beneficial. In 2006, the accounting firm Ernst & Young did an internal study of its employees and found that for each additional 10 hours of vacation employees took, their year-end performance ratings from supervisors (on a scale of one to five) improved by 8 percent. Frequent vacationers were also significantly less likely to leave the firm.
As athletes understand especially well, the greater the performance demand, the greater the need for renewal. When we're under pressure, however, most of us experience the opposite impulse: to push harder rather than rest. This may explain why a recent survey by Harris Interactive found that Americans left an average of 9.2 vacation days unused in 2012 -- up from 6.2 days in 2011.
The importance of restoration is rooted in our physiology. Human beings aren't designed to expend energy continuously. Rather, we're meant to pulse between spending and recovering energy.
In the 1950s, the researchers William Dement and Nathaniel Kleitman discovered that we sleep in cycles of roughly 90 minutes, moving from light to deep sleep and back out again. They named this pattern the Basic-Rest Activity Cycle or BRAC. A decade later, Professor Kleitman discovered that this cycle recapitulates itself during our waking lives.
The difference is that during the day we move from a state of alertness progressively into physiological fatigue approximately every 90 minutes. Our bodies regularly tell us to take a break, but we often override these signals and instead stoke ourselves up with caffeine, sugar and our own emergency reserves -- the stress hormones adrenaline, noradrenaline and cortisol.
Working in 90-minute intervals turns out to be a prescription for maximizing productivity. Professor K. Anders Ericsson and his colleagues at Florida State University have studied elite performers, including musicians, athletes, actors and chess players. In each of these fields, Dr. Ericsson found that the best performers typically practice in uninterrupted sessions that last no more than 90 minutes. They begin in the morning, take a break between sessions, and rarely work for more than four and a half hours in any given day.
''To maximize gains from long-term practice,'' Dr. Ericsson concluded, ''individuals must avoid exhaustion and must limit practice to an amount from which they can completely recover on a daily or weekly basis.''
I've systematically built these principles into the way I write. For my first three books, I sat at my desk for up 10 hours a day. Each of the books took me at least a year to write. For my two most recent books, I wrote in three uninterrupted 90-minute sessions -- beginning first thing in the morning, when my energy was highest -- and took a break after each one.
Along the way, I learned that it's not how long, but how well, you renew that matters most in terms of performance. Even renewal requires practice. The more rapidly and deeply I learned to quiet my mind and relax my body, the more restored I felt afterward. For one of the breaks, I ran. This generated mental and emotional renewal, but also turned out to be a time in which some of my best ideas came to me, unbidden. Writing just four and half hours a day, I completed both books in less than six months and spent my afternoons on less demanding work.
The power of renewal was so compelling to me that I've created a business around it that helps a range of companies including Google, Coca-Cola, Green Mountain Coffee, the Los Angeles Police Department, Cleveland Clinic and Genentech.
Our own offices are a laboratory for the principles we teach. Renewal is central to how we work. We dedicated space to a ''renewal'' room in which employees can nap, meditate or relax. We have a spacious lounge where employees hang out together and snack on healthy foods we provide. We encourage workers to take renewal breaks throughout the day, and to leave the office for lunch, which we often do together. We allow people to work from home several days a week, in part so they can avoid debilitating rush-hour commutes. Our workdays end at 6 p.m. and we don't expect anyone to answer e-mail in the evenings or on the weekends. Employees receive four weeks of vacation from their first year.
Our basic idea is that the energy employees bring to their jobs is far more important in terms of the value of their work than is the number of hours they work. By managing energy more skillfully, it's possible to get more done, in less time, more sustainably. In a decade, no one has ever chosen to leave the company. Our secret is simple -- and generally applicable. When we're renewing, we're truly renewing, so when we're working, we can really work.

They're From the Future, and Canada

SQUAMISH, British Columbia -- The people behind ''Continuum,'' a slick Canadian science-fiction drama recently imported to the United States by Syfy, are very conscious that their growing international audience is a demanding, detail-oriented bunch. But the other day during the filming here of a Season 2 scene that had actors in a drainage tunnel with a roaring helicopter at one end, one detail was beyond anyone's control.
''Hair continuity is a real problem with the wind tunnel,'' Rachel Nichols, the show's star, said after sprinting from the tunnel for yet another take, her long hair hopelessly askew.
Ms. Nichols plays a police officer from the future on the series, which became a hit for the Showcase cable network in Canada during its first season last year and began showing on Syfy last month. American viewers have long been accustomed to British imports -- ''Downton Abbey,'' all those interchangeable detective shows -- but ''Continuum'' is a reminder that Canadian series can also be competitive in the international marketplace. 
''The show has now sold to 50 countries, and I think one of the reasons it has is because it looks like a quote-unquote American show,'' Simon Barry, its creator, said over lunch in Vancouver the day before the Squamish shoot. ''Everybody in this town knows how to make those, because a lot of them are made here. But traditionally Canadian shows haven't really leveraged that aspect of the filmmaking process.''
It helped too that Mr. Barry's premise for the series has sociopolitical resonance in almost any country. Ms. Nichols's character, Kiera, is a police officer (or ''protector,'' as they're called in the future) in Vancouver in 2077 who, as the show opens, is on hand for the execution of the members of Liber8, a terrorist group responsible for a devastating bomb attack on the corporations that rule the late-21st-century world. Just before the sentence is carried out the eight convicts transport themselves back in time, accidentally bringing Kiera along.
They wind up in the Vancouver of 2012, the Liber8 members trying to stop the coming of a world in which civil government has been supplanted and Kiera -- still loyal to the corporate government of 2077 -- doing her best to thwart them. The show's deliberate ambiguity has fans debating on chat boards whether ''Continuum'' is a pro-business, right-wing series or the opposite. And Kiera, as Season 1 progresses, gradually confronts the possibility that she is fighting for the wrong side.
''We're trying to keep the gray area gray,'' Mr. Barry said. ''We all know the old saying of one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter. Conceptually we can mine that for drama.''
He added, ''Time travel and displacement of time allow for displacement of perception and perspective.''
Contributing to Kiera's angst is concern about the husband and son she left behind in 2077, giving a personal dimension to the classic time traveler's worry about whether intervening in the past will alter the future.
For Ms. Nichols, whose previous work includes the CBS drama ''Criminal Minds,'' the role is a mental as well as a physical workout, since each episode spends time in both 2077 and our present.
''It's studying up two different characters, one from a time that I know that my character doesn't know, and one from a time that I don't know that my character does know,'' she said. ''It's a little complex.''
The show came about almost by accident. Mr. Barry, who got his start in the business as a cameraman, spent years writing for various pilots in the American market but had never had a series make it to air. He was developing ''Continuum'' in hopes of pitching it to an American cable network, but he put it on the shelf when he was hired to work on still another pilot.
There it sat until October 2010, when Pat Williams, a veteran director with whom Mr. Barry had worked, was scheduled for a routine meeting with Shaw Media, a Toronto company whose properties include the Showcase channel. Mr. Williams, looking for a project to pitch at that session, asked Mr. Barry if he had anything in the works, and ''Continuum'' came up.
Shaw liked what it heard. Tom Rowe of Reunion Pictures became an executive producer along with Mr. Barry and Mr. Williams, adding a layer of production and financing expertise, and Jeff King, a producer on series like ''White Collar,'' helped Mr. Barry get up to speed on how to be a show runner. The premiere of ''Continuum'' last May drew 1.7 million viewers, a significant number in Canada, where the population is 35 million.
Thomas P. Vitale, Syfy's executive vice president for programming and original movies, said he knew ''Continuum'' was a good fit for his network a few minutes into the first episode.
''As the world gets smaller and smaller, these international shows are more appealing, and we'll be buying more of them,'' Mr. Vitale said. ''Good entertainment cuts across national lines.''
Countless American series have been shot in Canada over the years, of course, but recently shows initially made for the Canadian market, like ''Flashpoint,'' have been successful abroad. ''Continuum'' joined another Canadian show, ''Lost Girl,'' on Syfy's Monday night lineup.
''These aren't just schedule fillers,'' Mr. Vitale said. ''These are high-profile shows.''
And the actors can feel that they're in a different league.
''Five years or 10 years ago a Canadian show would only be a Canadian show, '' Victor Webster, who plays Kiera's 2012 police partner, said as he waited for the next blast of helicopter hurricane. ''But the shows that are coming out of Canada now are so good.''
The scene being shot here was fairly elaborate for the series, so much so that cast members were taking cellphone pictures as if they'd never seen a helicopter before. Other high-impact visuals come courtesy of Artifex Studios, a special-effects outfit in Vancouver where the owner, Adam Stern, and his staff brought the Vancouver of 2077 to life.
Anyone who knows present-day Vancouver was given a lot to think about the first time 2077 Vancouver was unveiled. Stanley Park, the city's equivalent of Central Park, had sprouted skyscrapers, and discerning viewers noted a dam in the background in English Bay, presumably holding back the higher water levels produced by global warming.
Not that Mr. Barry would make any of that explicit in the scripts. ''Continuum'' fans don't need to be told what to draw from a given scene; they're scrutinizing everything pretty carefully. Kiera, for instance, has digitally enhanced vision, and shots from her point of view have graphic displays imposed on them. It quickly became apparent from fan feedback that certain obsessive viewers were freeze-framing those shots and studying the graphics for information.
''I go to my guys and say, 'That can't be gibberish,' '' Mr. Barry recalled. So the digital displays contain nuggets for the freeze-framers.
And there's the matter of the horse that 2012 Kiera encounters in a Season 1 episode coming up this month for Syfy viewers. The decision was to have Ms. Nichols play the moment as if she had never seen a horse before.
''The Internet lit up, because we never actually said why she reacted,'' Mr. Barry said. ''And a huge conversation was triggered about whether there were animals in 65 years, whether global climate change affected the ecosystem -- all these variations of things that, by the way, we would never have thought up in the room when we were writing. The lesson there is: You don't have to spell it out.''

Giffords Eases Steadily Into New Life, and Cause

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

LENGTH: 1530 words

TUCSON -- Gabrielle Giffords looked slightly stricken as she considered the question: Would she feel bad about starring in a political advertisement against her former House colleagues who declined to stand with her on guns? ''Yes,'' she said, it would be painful.
''Sometimes you have to do things that are hard,'' said Mark E. Kelly, Ms. Giffords's husband, as she tucked herself close to him on their couch. Ms. Giffords nodded, as she often does when Mr. Kelly -- as he often does -- intuits the many thoughts she is still unable to express fully. ''Really hard,'' she added.
Ms. Giffords, a former Democratic congresswoman from Arizona, a gun owner, an astronaut's wife, a shooting survivor and an incipient gun-control advocate, is settling into the third act of her public life.
Her career as a lawmaker is behind her, but so is her role as the fragile, slightly mysterious victim in the months after she was shot point-blank in a parking lot here just over two years ago. Now, she is the face and emotional dynamism behind a new advocacy group and a separate political action committee, Americans for Responsible Solutions, dedicated to reducing gun violence. It is an effort, she said, that gives her ''purpose.'' 
Ms. Giffords's hair, short and wispy for some time after her brain surgery, has returned to its natural bounce. Once heavily guarded by Capitol Police officers and a stream of medical professionals, Ms. Giffords now lives with Mr. Kelly and his 15-year-old daughter, Claire, and Nelson, her service dog, in a modern adobe-style house they bought in August, decorated with bright, large-scale paintings and sculptures.
Ms. Giffords's ability to understand others is unscathed. During a two-hour interview here, she talked about whether she missed Washington (''a little''); explained, in short phrases, her positions on firearms; and made a sly one-word joke (''wasteland'') about one of her least favorite places. She revealed the provenance of some of her paintings (her old Congressional office), pointed out one that was PG-13 (a semiabstract nude), and lamented what a recent frost had taken from her garden. Once limited to two words -- ''what'' and ''chicken'' -- each month she gains more.
Speaking in full sentences is still a struggle, and she has regular therapy sessions to help recover her speech and to manage her other impairments. Her vision is impaired, and her right leg and arm are largely paralyzed. She can move her shoulder, her hip and slightly her foot.
The rest of her time is largely spent preparing for the legislative battles, political campaigns and potential face-offs with friends and former colleagues that will be waged through her month-old organizations. She and Mr. Kelly are already looking at governor contests, Congressional special elections and 2014 races. They hope to influence the outcome by leveraging the power of their names and their story, an effort presaged last month when Ms. Giffords lit up a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing with her brief and powerful plea: ''We must do something.''
''Sometimes there will be some difficult conversations,'' Mr. Kelly said. ''There already have been.''
For nearly two decades, the National Rifle Association has succeeded in rewarding lawmakers who backed legislation supporting gun rights and firearm manufacturers and punishing those who did not. Those efforts largely overwhelmed the voices on the opposing side.
But after the mass shooting in Newtown, Conn., in December that left 20 elementary school pupils dead, Ms. Giffords and Mr. Kelly -- with several others like Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York -- are trying to sway races from the other side.
Mr. Bloomberg's political action committee, Independence USA, was widely credited with bringing an end to the career of Representative Joe Baca, Democrat of California, last year after it spent $3.3 million on television ads and mailers attacking him. That political action committee is now focusing on Debbie Halvorson, a Democratic former congresswoman who is running in a special election to succeed former Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. in the Chicago area.
The Coalition to Stop Gun Violence recently ran newspaper advertisements against Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a freshman Democrat from North Dakota who has been critical of President Obama's legislative proposals to curtail some guns, and made a video criticizing Representative John Barrow, Democrat of Georgia, a strong advocate of gun rights.
The Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a liberal group, has run an ad attacking Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, for his positions on guns.
These efforts are ''one of the most important things that has happened,'' said Dr. Garen J. Wintemute, the director of the violence prevention research program at the University of California, Davis. ''What has been completely missing is the financial counterweight to the N.R.A.''
Ms. Giffords and Mr. Kelly are particularly focused on two areas that Mr. Obama is pushing: an enhanced system of background checks that would prevent more criminals and the mentally ill from buying guns, and a limit on the capacity of magazines.
''A universal background check would have directly affected what happened here in Tucson,'' Mr. Kelly said, referring to the shooting in which six people were killed and many others, including his wife, were injured. The gunman, Jared L. Loughner, had been suspended from community college for behavioral reasons.
Ms. Giffords's two organizations have already raised millions of dollars from small online donations and from bigger gifts, including $1 million from Steve and Amber Mostyn, Houston trial lawyers, and a six-figure donation from Mr. Bloomberg. The political action committee will hold a fund-raiser before the State of the Union address on Tuesday night in Washington at one of Ms. Giffords's favorite restaurants.
''We're going to have to have money to be effective,'' Mr. Kelly said.
Mr. Bloomberg brings some of his substantial fortune to the cause, Dr. Wintemute said, but ''what he is not, and what Gabby Giffords and Mark Kelly are, are personally compelling representatives of the position that firearm violence need not be tolerated.''
The paradox of Ms. Giffords's role is clear. As a gun owner (she and her husband went target shooting just a few months ago) and a Westerner whose recovery has been watched closely across the nation, she is an effective spokeswoman for some changes to gun laws. Yet speaking is still her hardest task.
Mr. Kelly, a retired astronaut and former naval aviator who has emerged as a forceful, politically astute advocate for his wife's cause, fills in the verbal blanks on conference calls and in meetings with donors and members.
Their partnership evokes that of James S. and Sarah Brady, who became advocates for gun control after Mr. Brady, the White House press secretary, was shot during an assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan in 1981. Like Ms. Giffords, Mr. Brady was a well-liked and piquant personality whose injuries brought attention to gun violence. In many ways, Ms. Giffords seeks to build on the Brady Act, which created a background check for gun buyers, by making that requirement universal, including for private sales.
Mr. Kelly offers shades of the astronaut John Glenn, who headed up the Emergency Committee for Gun Control after the shooting deaths of Senator Robert F. Kennedy and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Political operatives on both sides of the aisle in Arizona widely expect Mr. Kelly to eventually run for office himself, something he has waved off for now.
Ms. Giffords's liability is in some ways her best asset; her labored speech is a stark reminder that even a member of Congress can be gunned down in broad daylight by someone who is mentally ill and armed with high-capacity magazines. Her short plea to Congress that ''you must act'' was the most memorable moment of a several-hour Senate hearing. ''With just a few words,'' said John Feinblatt, Mr. Bloomberg's chief policy adviser, ''she was able to express the feelings of a nation.''
Their uphill battle is bringing along lawmakers who feel pressed by the N.R.A. to resist enhanced background checks and limits on high-capacity ammunition, as Ms. Giffords once did.
''Gabby, as a member of Congress, knows where they are coming from,'' Mr. Kelly said. ''We believe strongly that the Second Amendment affords every American the right to defend their home and defend their property with a gun. But there needs to be reasonable limits.''
Ms. Giffords's face lit up with joy when her mother, Gloria, a tough Arizona ranch dweller who can talk with great authority about the proper way to remove a mountain lion lurking in the yard, arrived for dinner. The older Ms. Giffords, whose property is still used by Ms. Giffords and Mr. Kelly for target shooting, said she had thought very little about the gun issue until her daughter was shot.
''It's very difficult to return to some type of peace of mind,'' she said. ''You feel something has been taken from you, besides the vitality of your child, but also your sense of justice, your sense of rightness in the world.''

Wisconsin Beats Buzzer, Then Michigan in Overtime

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

LENGTH: 785 words

With a 3-point lead and less than three seconds on the clock at the end of regulation, Michigan Coach John Beilein wanted his players to foul.
Wisconsin's Ben Brust never gave the Wolverines the chance.
Brust tied the game with a shot from just inside midcourt as time expired and then hit a 3-pointer with less than 40 seconds left in overtime to give Wisconsin a 65-62 home victory over No. 3 Michigan on Saturday.
Just moments before Brust's shot at the end of regulation, Tim Hardaway Jr. hit a contested 3-pointer for the Wolverines (21-3, 8-3 Big Ten). 
After a timeout, Mike Bruesewitz of Wisconsin (17-7, 8-3) passed up his first option in the inbounds play and then hit Brust in stride. Brust dribbled once across halfcourt and shot.
Beilein said the order coming out of the timeout was to foul. He also put Caris LeVert on Brust to bolster the defense.
''You're always picking them up in overtime,'' Beilein said. ''You're always saying something -- even if you're lying like crazy. 'Guys, we've got them where we want them. We're in better shape.' ''
The teams managed only 7 points combined in overtime, including the winning 3-pointer by Brust, who finished with 14 points.
FLORIDA 83, MISSISSIPPI ST. 58 Mike Rosario scored 18 points, and No. 2 Florida bounced back from a humbling loss earlier in the week to rout visiting Mississippi State.
Casey Prather, playing in place of the injured forward Will Yeguete, had 12 points and 5 rebounds for the Gators (19-3, 9-1 Southeastern Conference). Yeguete had arthroscopic surgery Friday to remove loose bodies in his right knee and will miss at least the rest of the regular season.
Mississippi State (7-15, 2-8) played without Jalen Steele, who did not make the trip after being suspended indefinitely for violating team rules.
OKLAHOMA 72, KANSAS 66 Romero Osby had 17 points, and host Oklahoma beat No. 5 Kansas (19-4, 7-3 Big 12) to give the Jayhawks their first three-game losing streak in eight years.
The Sooners (15-7, 6-4) took down a top-five opponent for the first time since 2006.
Kansas' Jeff Withey had his 258th career block, tying the team record.
GONZAGA 74, LOYOLA-MARYMOUNT 55 Kevin Pangos and Kelly Olynyk each scored 20 points as No. 6 Gonzaga (23-2, 10-0 West Coast) beat visiting Loyola Marymount (8-16, 1-10).
MICHIGAN ST. 78, PURDUE 65 Branden Dawson had 20 points as No. 12 Michigan State beat host Purdue (12-12, 5-6 Big Ten). The Spartans (20-4, 9-2) have won 9 of their last 10 and will retain at least a share of the league lead regardless of what happens Sunday, when Indiana visits Ohio State.
KANSAS ST. 79, IOWA ST. 70 Rodney McGruder scored 22 points, Angel Rodriguez added 20, and No. 13 Kansas State (19-4, 8-2) beat visiting Iowa State (16-7, 6-4) to take sole possession of first place in the Big 12.
U.N.L.V. 64, NEW MEXICO 55 Anthony Bennett had 17 points and 12 rebounds to lead Nevada-Las Vegas to a home victory against No. 15 New Mexico (20-4, 7-2 Mountain West).
The Runnin' Rebels (18-6, 5-4) entered the game desperately needing a win after surprising losses to Boise State and Fresno State. Although they shot just 37.1 percent (23 of 62) from the field, the Rebels were 9 of 22 (40.9 percent) from beyond the arc.OREGON 73, UTAH 64 E. J. Singler had 21 points, and No. 19 Oregon overcame a poor start to end its three-game losing streak with a home win over Utah (10-13, 2-9 Pacific-12).
Oregon (19-5, 8-3) trailed, 30-22, after the first half but pulled in front midway through the second. The Ducks led by as many as 13 points down the stretch.
MISSOURI 98, MISSISSIPPI 79 Alex Oriakhi had a career-high 22 points, 18 rebounds, 3 blocks and a central role in a second-half fracas as No. 21 Missouri (17-6, 6-4 SEC) easily beat visiting Mississippi (18-5, 7-3).
Phil Pressey had four assists to break Missouri's career record and had 22 points.
With about seven and a half minutes to go, Reginald Buckner was apparently tripped by Oriakhi and came up swinging with a couple of wild punches that missed Laurence Bowers as Oriakhi danced away. Buckner was ejected, and Oriakhi was called for a flagrant foul. Missouri's Bowers and Jabari Brown and Mississippi's Murphy Holloway were whistled for technical fouls.
OKLAHOMA ST. 72, TEXAS 59 Marcus Smart scored 23 points, and No. 22 Oklahoma State (17-5, 7-3 Big 12) cruised past host Texas (10-13, 2-8) for its fifth straight win.
Saturday was the end of the 23-game N.C.A.A. suspension for Texas guard Myck Kabongo, who is expected to play the rest of the season.
MARQUETTE 89, DEPAUL 78 Vander Blue scored 18 points as No. 24 Marquette held off visiting DePaul (10-13, 1-9 Big East). Marquette (17-5, 8-2) moved a half-game ahead of No. 9 Syracuse for first place in the Big East.

Amid Protests, India Executes Man in '01 Parliament Attack

BYLINE: By NEHA THIRANI BAGRI

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 10

LENGTH: 502 words

MUMBAI, India -- India hanged a man on Saturday who had been convicted of involvement in a 2001 attack on Parliament that killed nine people.
The hanging of the man, Muhammad Afzal, also known as Afzal Guru, a 43-year-old militant with the group Jaish-e-Muhammad, came more than a decade after the Dec. 13, 2001, suicide attack on India's Parliament, in which five gunmen armed with grenades, guns and explosives opened fire, killing nine people, most of them security officials. The execution drew protests from human rights groups concerned about the growing use of capital punishment in such cases. 
Mr. Afzal was convicted of conspiracy in the plot and sentenced to death by a special court in 2002. In 2004, the Indian Supreme Court upheld the death sentence.
After the execution, clashes broke out in Mr. Afzal's hometown, Sopore, in the northern part of Jammu and Kashmir State, and the police and paramilitary units were called to restore order. Days before the execution, President Pranab Mukherjee had rejected a plea for mercy from Mr. Afzal's wife, according to reports from The Press Trust of India, paving the way for his hanging in the Tihar Jail complex near New Delhi, officials said.
The clashes in Mr. Afzal's hometown after his death came despite the imposition of a strict curfew in the region in anticipation of trouble from separatist leaders, according to news reports.
The authorities in Srinagar, the summer capital of Kashmir, asked residents to remain indoors and closed the national highway for one day.
Omar Abdullah, the Jammu and Kashmir chief minister, appealed for peace and calm.
''I understand there is a certain degree of angst and there are some people who would like to take advantage of the situation,'' Mr. Abdullah said. ''I appeal to the people to allow us to get through this with peace and not to resort to violent protests.''
Officials from the ruling Congress Party said the execution was a sign that India would not tolerate acts of terror.
''Anybody committing any acts of terror will be punished,'' said a Congress Party spokesman, Rashid Alvi. ''People of our country and government have zero tolerance for terrorism.''
But the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party criticized the government's delay in carrying out the execution.
''The attack on the Indian Parliament happened in 2001, that is 12 years ago, which was an attack on India,'' said a party spokesman, Ravi Shankar Prasad.
On Nov. 21, India hanged Ajmal Kasab, the only surviving Pakistani gunman from the November 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai, ending an eight-year moratorium on the death penalty and drawing criticism from rights groups, which they reiterated Saturday.
''The hanging of Afzal Guru, following closely behind the hanging of Ajmal Kasab in November, shows a very worrying trend by the Indian government,'' said Meenakshi Ganguly, the South Asia director for Human Rights Watch. ''Human Rights Watch opposes the death penalty in all circumstances as an inherently irreversible, inhumane punishment.''

Los Angeles To Reopen Its Inquiry Of Officer

BYLINE: By IAN LOVETT

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 16

LENGTH: 784 words

LOS ANGELES -- The Los Angeles Police Department will reopen its investigation into the 2007 episode that led to the firing of Christopher J. Dorner, the former police officer who is wanted in three killings, department officials said Saturday night.
Mr. Dorner pledged revenge against Los Angeles police officers in a manifesto he posted online, in which he also claimed that racism in the department had led to his dismissal. He is wanted in connection with the killing of a former police captain's daughter and her fiancי last Sunday and the shooting death of a Riverside, Calif., police officer on Thursday morning. 
''I am aware of the ghosts of the L.A.P.D.'s past, and one of my biggest concerns is that they will be resurrected by Dorner's allegations of racism within the department,'' Chief Charlie Beck said in a written statement.
''Therefore, I feel we need to also publicly address Dorner's allegations regarding his termination,'' he said. ''I do this not to appease a murderer. I do it to reassure the public that their Police Department is transparent and fair in all the things we do.''
The killings and Mr. Dorner's online manifesto have reopened old wounds for some black residents here, even as they condemned the violence. For decades, the Los Angeles Police Department was known nationwide for racism and corruption. And memories are still fresh of the riots in 1992 that followed the beating of a black man, Rodney King, by white police officers. The beating was caught on videotape and broadcast around the country.
In explaining why he chose to reopen Mr. Dorner's case, Chief Beck acknowledged his department's difficult history.
''The Los Angeles Police Department has made tremendous strides in gaining the trust and confidence of the people we serve,'' he said in his statement, and he conceded that ''Dorner's actions may cause a pause in our increasingly positive relationship with the community.''
Mr. Dorner, who joined the Police Department in 2005, was fired in 2008 for giving false statements, after he accused his training officer of kicking a suspect. He sued the department for wrongful termination, and lost at trial and again on appeal.
The decision to review Mr. Dorner's termination marks a reversal from the tone Chief Beck struck just two days ago, when he was asked about Mr. Dorner's accusations of racism at a news conference.
''You're talking about a homicide suspect who has committed atrocious crimes,'' he said. ''If you want to give any attribution to his ramblings on the Internet, go right ahead. But I do not.''
Asked about Mr. Dorner's efforts to clear his name, Chief Beck said, point blank, ''It's not going to happen.''
Joe Domanick, at professor at the University of Southern California's Annenberg Institute for Justice and Journalism, and author of ''To Protect and To Serve,'' a history of the Los Angeles Police Department, said that Chief's Beck and his predecessor as police chief, William Bratton, had gone a long way toward repairing relations with the black and Latino communities in Los Angeles.
But, he added, ''Old suspicions die hard.''
''The history of the L.A.P.D. with the African-American community has been so fraught with mistrust and abuse and hatred on both sides,'' Mr. Domanick said. ''Charlie Beck is a very savvy guy, who really understands community relations and community policing. Right now, it's in his interest to quell these rumors.''
An episode on Thursday morning, in which two women delivering newspapers in Torrance, Calif., were shot by Los Angeles police officers who mistook their vehicle for Mr. Dorner's pickup truck, made the need for Chief Beck to reach out to the community even greater, Mr. Domanick said.
One of the women, Emma Hernandez, 71, who was struck by two bullets in her back, was released from the hospital on Friday night, according to her lawyer. Her daughter, Margie Carranza, 47, suffered an wound to her hand. Chief Beck met with the two women on Saturday and told them that the department had arranged for the donation of a new truck for them, Cmdr. Andrew Smith said.
Their lawyer, Glen T. Jonas, said their pickup truck was hit with dozens of rounds, though he could not confirm exactly how many. Los Angeles police officers were investigating the shooting, officials said, and would not release details.
Police officials here on Saturday also announced the formation of a task force that will bring together officers from Los Angeles, Irvine, and Riverside as well as from the F.B.I., the United States Marshal Service and other agencies in the hunt for Mr. Dorner.
The search has already taken law enforcement officers from dozens of agencies, including from San Diego and Riverside and Nevada.

When a life starts to unravel, where do you turn for help?
Melissa Klump began to slip in the eighth grade. She couldn't focus in class, and in a moment of despair she swallowed 60 ibuprofen tablets. She was smart, pretty and ill: depression, attention deficit disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, either bipolar disorder or borderline personality disorder.
In her 20s, after a more serious suicide attempt, her parents sent her to a residential psychiatric treatment center, and from there to another. It was the treatment of last resort. When she was discharged from the second center last August after slapping another resident, her mother, Elisa Klump, was beside herself.
''I was banging my head against the wall,'' the mother said. ''What do I do next?'' She frantically called support groups, therapy programs, suicide prevention lines, anybody, running down a list of names in a directory of mental health resources. ''Finally,'' she said, ''somebody told me, 'The person you need to talk to is Carolyn Wolf.' '' 
That call, she said, changed her life and her daughter's. ''Carolyn has given me hope,'' she said. ''I didn't know there were people like her out there.''
Carolyn Reinach Wolf is not a psychiatrist or a mental health professional, but a lawyer who has carved out what she says is a unique niche, working with families like the Klumps.
One in 17 American adults suffers from a severe mental illness, and the systems into which they are plunged -- hospitals, insurance companies, courts, social services -- can be fragmented and overwhelming for families to manage. The recent shootings in Newtown, Conn., and Aurora, Colo., have brought attention to the need for intervention to prevent such extreme acts of violence, which are rare. But for the great majority of families watching their loved ones suffer, and often suffering themselves, the struggle can be boundless, with little guidance along the way.
''If you Google 'mental health lawyer,' '' said Ms. Wolf, a partner with Abrams & Fensterman, ''I'm kinda the only game in town.''
On a recent afternoon, she described in her Midtown office the range of her practice.
''We have been known to pull people out of crack dens,'' she said. ''I have chased people around hotels all over the city with the N.Y.P.D. and my team to get them to a hospital. I had a case years ago where the person was on his way back from Europe, and the family was very concerned that he was symptomatic. I had security people meet him at J.F.K.''
Many lawyers work with mentally ill people or their families, but Ron Honberg, the national director of policy and legal affairs for the National Alliance on Mental Illness, said he did not know of another lawyer who did what Ms. Wolf does: providing families with a team of psychiatrists, social workers, case managers, life coaches, security guards and others, and then coordinating their services. It can be a lifeline -- for people who can afford it, Mr. Honberg said. ''Otherwise, families have to do this on their own,'' he said. ''It's a 24-hour, 7-day-a-week job, and for some families it never ends.''
Many of Ms. Wolf's clients declined to be interviewed for this article, but the few who spoke offered an unusual window on the arcane twists and turns of the mental health care system, even for families with money. Their stories illustrate how fraught and sometimes blind such a journey can be.
One rainy morning last month, Lance Sheena, 29, sat with his mother in the spacious family room of her Long Island home. Mr. Sheena was puffy-eyed and sporadically inattentive; the previous night, at the group home where he has been living since late last summer, another resident had been screaming incoherently and was taken away by the police. His mother, Susan Sheena, eased delicately into the family story.
''I don't talk to a lot of people because they don't get it,'' Ms. Sheena said. ''They mean well, but they don't get it unless they've been through a similar experience. And anytime something comes up, like the shooting in Newtown, right away it goes to the mentally ill. And you think, maybe we shouldn't be so public about this, because people are going to be afraid of us and Lance. It's a big concern.''
Her son cut her off. ''Are you comparing me to the guy that shot those people?''
''No, I'm saying that anytime there's a shooting, like in Aurora, that's when these things come out in the news.''
''Did you really just compare me to that guy?''
''No, I didn't compare you.''
''Then what did you say?''
''I said that when things like this happen, one of the first things you hear about is somebody being mentally ill.'' She added that her son, like most people with mental illness, has never been violent.
Ms. Wolf, a neighbor who attended the same synagogue, was one of the few people Ms. Sheena talked to about her son. Ms. Wolf started her career as a hospital administrator, then after law school represented hospitals in commitment hearings. Families of mentally ill people, she said, heard about her and began to turn to her for help.
A popular, athletic child, Lance started showing signs of obsessive-compulsive disorder at age 11 and began using drugs around the same age.
''I never had trouble buying drugs because I sold drugs,'' Mr. Sheena recalled. ''And when I wasn't buying drugs I got them from the doctor. Valium, Xanax, Adderall, Ritalin, Seroquel. Finished a bottle of Adderall in 12 hours once. That's like 30 pills, 20 mg. each. I was lying under the air-conditioner listening to my heart beat. Finally I woke up, took some Xanax.''
Eight years ago, after taking ''a lot of prescription drugs and Ecstasy,'' he said, he landed in the psychiatric ward at North Shore Hospital in a state of drug-induced psychosis. It was the first of several such stays, some by his volition, others against his will. Three years ago, Ms. Sheena came home to find him in the woods behind the house, wearing only shorts and a T-shirt in the January cold.
''The level of life I had in me that was productive was so low,'' he said. ''I was almost homeless, I was a complete bum, and I decided to clean the woods. It was the only thing I could do.''
Finally, at a psychiatric hospital upstate, he received a diagnosis of schizophrenia.
''It was tearing us apart,'' Ms. Sheena said. Her son's three younger brothers were angry at him for the turbulence in their home, she said. His youngest brother, who is now in high school, had never known a normal home life. After that hospitalization three years ago Lance Sheena stopped using drugs -- for his mother, he said.
Mr. Sheena returned to school and earned an associate's degree. But his illness follows its own agenda. Last summer, he became flooded with thoughts of death and was hospitalized twice in quick succession, the second time against his will. He left his mother angry messages, which she saved.
''Nasty messages,'' she said. '' 'I hate you. Get me out of here.' Nasty.''
''Why'd you save them?'' he asked.
''I don't know.''
''No really, why?''
During that time, Ms. Sheena began turning to Ms. Wolf for help. Ms. Wolf said she could petition to have Mr. Sheena released from the hospital and into a different kind of supervised involuntary commitment, known as assisted outpatient treatment, that would be less restrictive. But she also advised the Sheenas not to let their son move back into the family home.
''We were at a breaking point,'' Ms. Sheena said. ''He would come home and we'd be back in the same roles where I'm looking to see if he's going to his meetings, if he's taking his medicine. What is he doing? Is he sleeping? Is he bouncing off the walls all night?''
It was too much, Ms. Wolf said. ''I try to get people off of that, because I have found over these 20-plus years that it works better when you put the professionals in place and the family members go back to being the loved ones,'' she said.
Ms. Wolf helped Mr. Sheena move to a group home, where he has a case manager and social worker and takes the bus to court-mandated therapy appointments and group meetings. Now, when he returns home to visit, ''there's a real sense of calmness in the house,'' his mother said. ''It's wonderful, it's peaceful, it's loving, he sleeps home often on Friday night. And he's doing better because he's not as stressed, because we're not watching him like that.''
Mr. Sheena said he was unhappy about not being allowed to move back home. But his life is more stable, he said, and he has started to write about his experiences, with help from his mother.
''Now, he's the best he's been in the last 10 years,'' she said. ''He's come to accept that he's mentally ill, that he has an illness and that it needs to be treated. And I hope he can be better than he is now, but who knows?''
Not all of Ms. Wolf's clients can report even that much hope.
In a Midtown financial services office, a consultant whose son suffers from bipolar schizoaffective disorder described an almost unbroken series of setbacks, with his son now living in an efficiency hotel in Georgia, refusing to take medications or acknowledge that he needs care. To avoid causing more pain to family members, the father would be identified only by his first initial, J., and his son by the initial R.
''It tears your heart out as a parent, believe me,'' J. said.
J. first met Ms. Wolf more than a decade ago at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, where he was visiting his son and she was representing the hospital in commitment hearings. By that time, R., who is now in his early 40s, had been hospitalized involuntarily several times, each time ceasing treatment after he was released. He lost apartment after apartment, sometimes for harassing the owners or other residents.
Then he took a bigger step, going to the home of a film executive and harassing the man's wife. When he was arrested and charged, his father called Ms. Wolf.
''The D.A. wanted to put him in jail for two years,'' J. said. His son's criminal lawyer was ready to take a plea deal, which would involve prison time, the father said.
Instead, Ms. Wolf negotiated with the prosecution to allow him to be committed involuntarily to Bellevue Hospital Center. When R. petitioned to go home, saying he did not need treatment, Ms. Wolf argued that he was still a danger to himself and others.
''She went to court for us every Tuesday,'' the father said, ''and we were able to show cause why he should be kept there. And the doctors helped us, but only because Carolyn spoke to them and assisted us.''
After nine months in Bellevue, R. was finally discharged, against the efforts of Ms. Wolf and his father. Ms. Wolf engaged a psychiatrist, a case manager and someone to live with R. to make sure he took his medications. But soon he stopped complying again; nothing was different.
Now, J. would like to see his son in a residential psychiatric center or a hospital. But R. will not go voluntarily, and unless he commits a serious crime, the courts will not commit him long-term.
''I've gone through a fortune, and the system stinks,'' J. said. ''It can be shown by some of these recent killings in Sandy Hook and in Aurora. Or Virginia Tech. These are people who are mentally ill and they've proved that they're mentally ill, who the court system fails and the mental health system fails. You can see the glary, starey eyes of this killer from Aurora in court. I've seen that expression from my son when he's been locked up. And it's because he's totally psychotic.''
The day Melissa Klump, now 28, tried to kill herself, in April 2011, she woke with a sense of overwhelming serenity, knowing what she wanted to do. She had fought with her brother the day before, when he blamed her for destroying their parents' marriage.
''I was calm,'' she said. ''I went upstairs, I showered, I did my hair, I put on a nice little cute outfit, I wrote a letter to my grandmother apologizing for what I was about to do, and I wrote that I wanted to be cremated. I lined up all my pills and took a picture and sent it to my brother and I said, Happy Easter. And I downed 20 Xanax and 10 Trazodone, and took it all with a warm Corona.
''Just then my dad started pounding on the door. I opened the door and said, 'This is what you guys wanted, so here you go.' I threw my bottles down the stairs.''
At a recent appointment in Manhattan, she arrived early, with polished nails and crisp eye makeup, eager to talk -- about her suicide attempt, about her future, about her serial medication regimens: Lexapro, Effexor, Cymbalta, Xanax, Trazodone, Prozac, Klonopin, Lamictal, Ativan. She showed the delicate script tattoos on her wrists, reading ''Carpe Diem'' on one arm and ''La Bella Vita'' on the other, covering the places where she'd cut herself with a hot safety pin.
After she was sent home from the treatment center for slapping another resident, her mother took her to see Ms. Wolf, who asked her what her goals were.
''I didn't think she would ask me that,'' Melissa Klump said. ''It seemed nice that she was interested in me as a person. She said she had someone who could help. She also said I was one of her few clients who have goals and plans.''
Ms. Wolf arranged for a care manager and a life coach to see Ms. Klump several times a week at her grandmother's house.
Christopher Mooney, the care manager, said he was working with her to meet her goals: to pay down her five-figure credit card debt -- the result of a few manic sprees -- to set a budget, to make a financial plan; then they will start to look for apartments. ''She's got the capability, but she needs someone there to help her make it happen,'' he said.
Mr. Mooney bills $150 an hour for his time. The life coach, who meets with Ms. Klump more regularly, charges $50 an hour. Ms. Wolf would not discuss her fees.
It adds up, Elisa Klump said, especially on top of all the other expenses. ''We're coming to the point where there's going to be no more money left,'' she said. And still she knows that her daughter could slide back, as could any of the others. Their lives remain subject to powerful forces, both internal and external, for which a lawyer can do only so much.
''We're in baby steps,'' Elisa Klump said. ''She's lost many years of her life. Carolyn put her down the right road. We'll see where she goes.''

James Muri, 94, Bomber Pilot Honored For Valor in Battle of Midway, Is Dead

BYLINE: By PAUL VITELLO

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Obituary; Pg. 26

LENGTH: 550 words

James Muri survived the first half of June 4, 1942, on the strength of his Army Air Forces pilot training. That was the day of his first combat mission, and the first day of the Battle of Midway. He piloted an unwieldy B-26 twin-engine bomber through heavy antiaircraft fire, maneuvered it close to a Japanese aircraft carrier, dropped a torpedo and pulled away into a sky filled with enemy shells just as his bomb detonated.
He survived the second half of the day -- getting back to base with three wounded crewmen on board -- on the strength of a hunch. 
Mr. Muri, who died on Feb. 3 in Laurel, Mont., at 94, first had to evade the hail of antiaircraft fire still coming from the carrier he had just attacked. His inspiration, which saved the lives of his crew as well as his own, was to swing around, go in low and fly straight over the carrier's deck to avoid its guns.
''The guns were all pointing out. That was the safest place to be,'' he said, explaining his reasoning in a 2002 interview with The Billings Gazette. ''I always said we could have touched down if we had lowered the gear.''
Mr. Muri's return to his base on Midway Island was dogged by Zero fighter planes. After his two gunners were wounded, he sent his co-pilot to man the plane's antiaircraft machine guns during the long flight back.
He and his crewmen, all of whom survived, were among 42 members of the Army Air Forces awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for valor in the Battle of Midway, which was considered the decisive contest for control of the Pacific in World War II. Fourteen of the members killed in the battle received the medal posthumously.
Mr. Muri stayed in the Army Air Forces after the war, when it became the Air Force. He trained other pilots and served in several command posts around the world, including Japan, before retiring in 1959. He later became a real estate investor. But his combat mission in the Battle of Midway was his first and last.
''I don't think he minded one bit not flying another mission,'' said Mr. Muri's son, who is also named James Muri. ''It always surprised him a little that people even wanted to talk about it at all. I don't think he realized it was as big a deal as it turned out to be.''
James Perry Muri was born on Oct. 19, 1918, in Cartersville, Mont., the second of nine children of Rasmus and Nelle Muri, who were rancher-farmers. Soon after graduating from Custer County High School in Miles City, he joined the Army in 1936 and was a lieutenant in the Army Air Forces at the outbreak of the war. A younger brother, Robert, who died last year, also became an Army pilot and spent 15 months in a German prison camp after his plane was shot down.
Besides his son, Mr. Muri's survivors include a daughter, Sylvia Saadati; four brothers, William, Buck, Karl and Pete; a sister, Marie Ansoms; and seven grandchildren.
On Christmas Day in 1941, a few weeks after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Mr. Muri married Alice Moyer of Riverside, Calif. Her nickname was Susie Q., and Mr. Muri had it stenciled on his plane's cockpit.
On June 4, 1942, after a near crash landing at the base (the landing gear had been shot up), Mr. Muri and his crew said they counted 500 holes in the fuselage of the Susie Q. He credited his wife, who died in 2001, with the miracle of his survival.

In Address, President Will Lay Out Agenda Focused on the Middle Class

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR and JACKIE CALMES

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 19

LENGTH: 1315 words

WASHINGTON -- President Obama on Tuesday will seek to move beyond the politics of the moment to define a second-term agenda built around restoring economic prosperity to the middle class, using his State of the Union address to unveil initiatives in education, infrastructure, clean energy and manufacturing.
Having secured four more years in the White House by arguing that the nation's economy is tilted against ordinary Americans, Mr. Obama will vow to use the power of his office to recapture robust job growth and economic expansion, according to White House officials who have seen the speech. Both eluded him during his first term.
Mr. Obama will insist that only ''a thriving middle class'' can stimulate long-term growth and that Americans must be given the tools to succeed, according to the officials, who discussed the speech on the condition of anonymity. His call for new government investments -- many of which Republicans successfully blocked in his first term -- is an effort to shift the emphasis away from simply reducing the deficit and will serve in part as an answer to Republican criticism that he has not focused enough on jobs. 
''I think you will hear him talk about some new proposals that build on his earlier efforts to help middle-class Americans,'' said Nancy-Ann DeParle, who until recently was Mr. Obama's deputy chief of staff. ''I think his message will be -- as he is -- very positive and optimistic: 'We're strong, and we're moving in the right direction. The economy is improving, but we have more work to do to ensure that all Americans can take advantage of a stronger economy.' ''
White House aides declined to describe the initiatives in the four subject areas, and said there would be other proposals in the address as well. But the officials familiar with the speech said that any proposed spending would be offset by new savings or revenues to avoid adding to annual budget deficits.
The president is structuring his fifth annual address to a joint session of Congress around three main economic points: making the nation a ''magnet for jobs and manufacturing''; providing Americans the ''skills they need'' for those jobs; and ensuring that ''hard work leads to a decent living,'' officials said.
Mr. Obama will try to summon the nation's support for two major initiatives that are already consuming the first weeks of his second term: the passage of stricter gun laws in the wake of the school massacre in Newtown, Conn., and an overhaul of immigration policy that would allow 11 million illegal immigrants to eventually become citizens.
He will also confront his looming clash with Congress over taxes and spending next month with a blunt warning to his Republican adversaries -- that continued fiscal brinkmanship could cause an economic slump that would be devastating to millions of Americans. He will renew his call for a ''big deal'' that would lower the deficit by cutting spending, revamping the tax code and making long-term changes to slow the growth in spending for Medicare and to stabilize Social Security.
But the main focus of the address, the officials said, will be on finding a new balance in the economy by expanding opportunities for average Americans without saddling the next generation with enormous debt.
''Our economy succeeds and our economy grows when everybody is getting a fair shot and everybody is getting a fair shake and everybody is playing by the same rules,'' Mr. Obama told House Democrats at a legislative retreat last week, offering a peek at the themes he will discuss on Tuesday night.
Mr. Obama's agenda faces certain skepticism and opposition from a Republican Party that has fought for years against what it views as runaway spending, big government and overreaching regulation. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida will deliver the Republican response.
Mr. Obama will not soon get a similar opportunity to shape the trajectory of his presidency. Millions of people are likely to tune in for what has become an annual ritual in which presidents set expectations for Congress, for the public and for themselves.
The address, in the House chamber, has evolved into a mix of politics, policy and pageantry, and Mr. Obama will heed modern tradition by hosting a group of Americans whose presence is intended to send a message about his priorities.
The president's speech opening his second term comes amid economic recovery, in contrast with the financial crisis that was the backdrop for his address in 2009. While housing and most other economic indicators point toward slow and steady growth, unemployment remains near 8 percent and is projected to decrease only fitfully.
Throughout his presidency, Mr. Obama has struggled to claim credit for economic successes without seeming out of touch with the millions of Americans who remain jobless and frustrated about the pace of improvement in their lives.
''One of the hardest things to get right is that one line where you describe, 'The state of our union is -- blank,' and how you fill in that blank,'' said Donald A. Baer, the chief executive of the global public relations firm Burson-Marsteller and a former speechwriter for President Bill Clinton.
Last month, in his second Inaugural Address, Mr. Obama made an aggressive case for a liberal agenda that included having greater tolerance toward immigrants, advancing gay rights, preserving the social safety system and confronting climate change. The White House officials said the president viewed Tuesday's speech as a second act in the same play.
For Mr. Obama, the State of the Union address is an oversize opportunity to confront and challenge Republicans directly on issues like immigration, stricter background checks for gun buyers, marriage equality and further tax increases on the wealthy -- all issues where the public is on his side, according to polls.
On guns, Mr. Obama will renew his call for a broad package of legislation focused on reducing violence by restricting some access to firearms. He will urge Congress to ban the manufacture and sale of assault weapons, put limits on high-capacity ammunition magazines, improve background checks and prevent sales of firearms to people with mental illness.
In remarks in recent weeks, the president has made it clear that he views universal background checks for gun purchases as the most likely measure to pass in a divided Congress, though aides have said that he would not back away from his support for a new assault weapons ban if it can pass.
On immigration, the president will say he intends to make good on his promise to revamp the nation's immigration system and eventually provide a pathway to citizenship for the millions of immigrants in the country illegally.
Buoyed by big support among Hispanics and Asians in his re-election, Mr. Obama is betting that Republicans are ready to join him in that effort. But as in the fight over guns, success may hinge on reaching the kinds of compromises that have proved exceedingly difficult during the past four years.
As in previous years, Mr. Obama will not spend much time in the speech focusing on foreign policy, though his administration faces numerous challenges around a complicated world: instability in the Middle East, nagging questions about Afghanistan's ability to maintain security after American troops leave, growing scrutiny of a continuing drone campaign against terrorists, threats from Iran and North Korea, and increasing global competition from China.
A year ago, as he headed into his re-election campaign, Mr. Obama opened his State of the Union address by heralding the death of Osama bin Laden and the shrinking American troop presence in Iraq and Afghanistan.
With the election behind him, Mr. Obama could return to some of the promises he made in his first term, including a vow to reduce the world's nuclear stockpiles and a pledge to work on peace between Israel and the Palestinians.

A Leg Rebuilt, A Life Renewed

DURHAM, N.C. -- Jay Williams had a dream.
On the night before his first college basketball game -- before he started for Duke at Madison Square Garden, before he became a national champion and the occupant of Michael Jordan's old locker in Chicago -- Williams fell asleep in a hotel room. He saw himself spinning in the air, around and around, over and over, until a red fire hydrant came into view.
''So weird,'' he thought when he woke up.
Williams forgot about the dream until nearly four years later, until June 2003, on a side street on the North Side of Chicago. He sat atop a red-and-black Yamaha R6, a sport bike that weighed about 400 pounds and boasted a 600-cubic-centimeter engine. He revved the engine once and heard it purr, the gear, he believed, in neutral. 
He loved that sound, but he especially loved the way he felt those times when his bike shot forward. ''Like how I felt in transition,'' Williams said, ''like if I caught the ball with a full head of steam and knew I was going to score.'' Sometimes, he pushed the bike past 120 miles per hour, faster, faster, faster, until the landscape blurred.
On that afternoon in June, Williams again revved the engine, only this time, the motorcycle surged forward unexpectedly, shot like a bullet from a gun. The front wheel lifted off the ground for an accidental wheelie. Williams was not wearing a helmet, did not have a proper license, was in violation of his contract with the Chicago Bulls. He gripped the handlebars, which only seemed to make the bike go faster, which only made him lose control.
''I'm gone,'' Williams said. ''I'm flying. I'm going 50, 60 miles an hour. As I look up, I see a utility pole, and I couldn't turn the bike and get out of the way.''
Williams clipped the pole with the left side of his body, which sent him spinning, around and around, over and over. He could not feel his left side, or anything from the waist down. He did not think about death, amputation or depression. He thought only about his career.
He lay there, numb, in shock, terrified but so full of adrenaline that his body blocked out most of the pain. It felt as if someone were pouring water on him. He passed out and woke up in an ambulance, passed out again and woke up in a hospital. Even the doctors looked scared. They needed to contact his parents, needed to operate immediately. They worried about amputation, about death.
Williams remembered little but clung to an image from the scene, his first glance sideways as he spun.
There it was: a red fire hydrant.
He screamed: ''You threw it all away! You threw it all away!''
An Inescapable Memory
Imagine the worst day of your life.
Then imagine confronting that day every single day thereafter.
Imagine lying in intensive care, watching on television as your team drafts your replacement. Imagine lying on your back, for months at a time, unsure if you will walk again, your leg held together by 100 staples and various metal contraptions.
Imagine the taunts, the ridicule, the built-in comeback -- ''Go buy another motorcycle, Williams.'' Imagine walking through an airport -- ''Way to screw your life up, Williams.'' Imagine working for ESPN, analyzing games -- ''Should have stuck to motorcycles, Williams.''
Imagine life as the Guy Who Threw It All Away.
''I've thought back to that moment a lot because people won't let me forget,'' Williams said. ''And this might sound crazy, but it was the worst decision I made and the best thing that ever happened to me.''
He added, ''This isn't a pity story.''
Williams, 31, can say that now, more than nine years removed from the accident that nearly ended his life and irrevocably altered it. It took him that long to come to terms with the entirety of his story -- high school all-American, national player of the year and national champion at Duke, No. 2 overall N.B.A. draft selection, and all that before the accident, before the hospital, before the injury that ended his professional career after one season and made him a retiree at 21.
In a series of interviews over the last three months, Williams, for the first time, detailed all that he went through.
For years, Williams struggled with depression. He refused to wear shorts or show anyone his left leg. He asked the inevitable: why me? He took too much pain medication, too much OxyContin in particular, for too long. He blew out the candles for his 22nd birthday in bed. He spent years in rehabilitation. He resented the teammates who lacked his drive but remained in the N.B.A., collecting paychecks, accolades, even championship rings. He cried himself to sleep. He went to therapy. He moved to New York City and tried to become an agent and drank alcohol frequently.
In those dark years, he would run into people who expected the image Jay Williams once projected to the world: that of the clean-cut Duke point guard who posed on the cover of Sports Illustrated in khakis and a letterman's jacket, flashing a thumbs up, the photograph that best seemed to embody the stereotype of Duke, so prim and pristine. In strangers' eyes, where he once saw awe or jealousy, he now saw pity, and from people, normal people, who could never understand the gifts he held that vanished on that street.
At his lowest point, Williams did more than consider suicide. ''I remember lying in my bed,'' he said. ''And I'm just tired of being here. I didn't want to be here anymore. I was so afraid to face people. And I didn't really know who I was. And I didn't really want anybody to see me. And I didn't want to talk to anybody. I didn't want to talk about it.''
Williams glanced at his mother, Althea Williams, as he recounted the story. He continued: ''I mean, to the point where I sat there, and I had this pair of scissors in my hand. I just kept going on my wrist. I wasn't trying to go sideways. I was going vertical. I didn't want to be here. At all.''
His mother added: ''I came in. I saw it. I slept in the room every day after that.''
''That was the lowest point in my life,'' Williams said. ''And if I had more time, if the scissors weren't dull, I think I would have followed through with it. I can't say for sure. But I was leaning toward that.''
Mementos and Scars
Williams now lives in Durham, near the site of his greatest triumphs, surrounded by magazine covers and mementos from the glory days. A framed letter from Mike Krzyzewski reads, in part, ''I loved coaching you.'' Pictures show Williams with Duke assistants, Duke teammates; on defense, clad in a Duke jersey. There is little from his lone season with the Bulls.
When Duke's archrival, North Carolina, won the national championship in 2009, someone rang Williams's doorbell, and when he opened it, he saw toilet paper covering much of his property. He suspected the Tar Heels fan next door. By the next morning, the toilet paper had been removed.
Mostly, Williams lives in peace, with his mother and a Rottweiler named Heaven, who replaced a Rottweiler named Duke who died a few years back.
Upstairs, near the pool table, surrounded by his Duke memorabilia, Williams allowed pictures of his leg to be taken for the first time since the accident.
''It looks pretty gnarly, dude,'' he said.
The leg resembled a map of Williams's lost years: remnants of 10-plus operations; marks from the 100 staples; a scar that ran from pelvis to ankle; smaller divots from the numerous knee scopes. Williams sustained a total knee dislocation in the accident. He tore every ligament. He dislocated his pelvis. He ripped through a nerve in his left foot that took a year to regenerate, the pain comparable to that of childbirth, so severe it would wake Williams in the middle of the night. He severed an artery. He tore the hamstring from the bone.
As he lay in the hospital, his leg atrophied. He lost muscle, then tone, until the leg withered away and looked to Williams like a pencil, or a toothpick. Doctors told Williams he might never again be able to get an erection, despite all the pictures of scantily clad, beautiful women his friends jokingly left during hospital visits.
''It looked similar to wounds I've seen from military men and women, coming back from battle,'' said Jason Gauvin, one of Williams's physical therapists, who now owns and runs Athletic Advantage Physical Therapy in Durham. ''Like he had been hit by an I.E.D., with multiple severe injuries at the hip, knee and ankle joints.''
Often, Williams wondered how he ended up there. His interest in basketball sprouted from trips he took with his mother to help his grandmother through dialysis, drives up the Garden State Parkway, where he shot quarters over the front seat and into the baskets for the tolls. Racked by insecurity, consumed by self-doubt, Williams would score 40 points and ask his mother if it was true, if he could play in college. This from an all-American.
Williams blossomed late on the national scene, according to Dresden Baluyot, his best friend and a fellow native of Plainfield, N.J. One high school coach even urged Williams to accept an early scholarship offer to Fordham.
He did not, and later impressed Krzyzewski with his game tape. Krzyzewski, the Duke coach, saw a compact, powerful point guard playing out of position, on the wing. He loved the way Williams attacked the basket, so low to the ground, so ferociously, as if the rim had somehow angered him.
''He could be an N.F.L. running back dribbling the basketball,'' Krzyzewski said. ''Like he's that strong. Like he jumped out of the screen. I knew as soon as I saw him he'd be special. Really, he was one of the most explosive players in the history of college basketball.''
Williams saved his best games for the biggest moments. He took over against Kentucky; buried North Carolina with 3-pointers; led the so-called Miracle Minute comeback against Maryland, winning after trailing by 10 with less than 60 seconds to play. One late Williams 3-pointer sealed Duke's national title in 2001, and there it was, another dream come true.
That was Williams, instinctive and electric, the consensus national player of the year his junior season. The Duke assistant Chris Collins spied Williams after one his worst performances, on an exercise bike before his next contest, at Michigan in 2001, soaked in sweat. He tallied 14 points and 2 assists in the first five minutes as Duke jumped to a 23-4 lead.
''To this day, I say no one loved playing basketball more than Jason,'' Collins said in his Duke office. ''In terms of just playing games, how that felt, no one lit up more than he did.''
While at Duke, Williams decorated his body with tattoos, quotations and symbols that meant far more later on. On his right leg, he inked the Chinese symbol for sacrifice; on his right arm, two hands clasped together, praying, next to the words ''To err is human. To forgive is divine.'' He also added this, from Gandhi: ''Strength does not come from physical capacity. It comes from indomitable will.''
Williams nearly left after Duke won the national championship in his sophomore season. By then, when Baluyot walked with his friend around campus, he said, Williams seemed ''more like a god.'' He signed autographs, took pictures, soaked in all the adulation.
Krzyzewski dared Williams to be different, to stay and obtain his degree. He majored in sociology, graduated early and turned professional after his junior season. For his final thesis paper, he studied athletes who left college early, their backgrounds, why they failed or succeeded.
His mother threw a draft party for him in Manhattan on the night in 2002 when the Bulls selected him second over all, behind Yao Ming, the Chinese center taken by the Houston Rockets. Althea invited all of Williams's former girlfriends. That was awkward. The family celebrated until sunrise, exes notwithstanding.
Williams left for Chicago the next morning, the world spread below him, ripe with promise.
Ups, Downs and a Disaster
On the North Side of Chicago, near the intersection of Fletcher and Honore Streets, there are no reminders that Jay Williams threw it all away in this quiet neighborhood crowded with two-story homes and parallel-parked cars. There is, however, more than one bright red fire hydrant, along with Bulls fans who remember what could have been and what was not.
Williams wanted the Bulls to draft him, wanted to follow Jordan, whose locker had sat empty until Williams took it and ratcheted up already enormous expectations. Fans screamed his name while he walked the streets. He drove down Interstate 90, where his face filled a billboard. And he thought to himself, ''You made it.''
In his rookie season, Williams played against Jordan, who was then with the Washington Wizards. Jordan went at Williams on several consecutive possessions. Each time, Jordan told Williams how he would score -- first over the left shoulder, then fake over the left shoulder and shoot over the right, and so forth -- and each time, Jordan scored exactly as he said he would.
Williams asked to be called Jay around then, instead of Jason, to avoid confusion with the N.B.A. guard Jason Williams, known as White Chocolate, and the retired forward Jayson Williams, who later pleaded guilty to aggravated assault in the shooting death of a limousine driver. He never legally changed his name, but Jay stuck.
In hindsight, the change was indicative of a period of transformation.
Althea Williams moved into a house near the Bulls' practice facility, where she often rebounded while her only son shot jumpers after midnight. They remained as close as ever. Duke players called her Mama Will. She called them ''dude'' and introduced herself as Jay's sister and carried pompoms to the games. Even now, she often stays with her son and coaches the Durham Senior Divas, a cheerleading squad.
She watched her son struggle to adapt to the N.B.A., to the lifestyle, to all the losing after he accumulated a 95-13 record at Duke. Williams defended Allen Iverson one game, Jason Kidd the next, Steve Nash the game after that. He fought for playing time with Jamal Crawford. He went from regimented Duke, with every day planned to the minute, into a looser environment, with millions of dollars in his bank account and more free time than hobbies with which to fill it.
''I didn't know how to handle it at first,'' Williams said. ''I didn't know how to be around it. Guys were on the bench, trying to kick it to girls in the stands, having ball boys run over. I mean, some guys were high.''
Asked to clarify, Williams said: ''There were guys smoking weed before games. Guys asking in the middle of the game, 'Do you smell popcorn?' ''
He noticed the nervous laughter around the kitchen table. ''You think I'm playing,'' Williams said. ''Can you imagine! Guys are gambling. They're playing dice in the back of the plane for money. Like, we just lost by 30 tonight! And we've got a game tomorrow! It bugged me out.''
Still, Williams did not live like a monk back then. He attended the rookie symposium and listened to little of what was said. He fell into a lifestyle he described as ''typical'' of the N.B.A. He took private planes to Las Vegas with his friends, gambled, frequented nightclubs, fought with his parents. ''I lost who I was,'' Williams said.
By the end of his first season, he started to feel more comfortable, more able, especially on the court. That June, he returned to Duke, where he spoke at a basketball camp. Collins said Williams played pickup games that weekend at a level he had never previously reached, schooling his college counterparts, scoring at will, pulling his own Jordan. ''Just thinking about it gives me chills,'' Collins said.
Williams later told the campers that they could never predict the future, that they needed to stay in school as much as they needed to practice. ''You never know what will happen,'' he said.
He flew back to Chicago the next morning. His motorcycle sat in the garage. He had picked up the hobby after college, when it seemed normal, when Kobe Bryant arrived at a game on a bike and Jordan sponsored his own race team, Michael Jordan Motorsports, and Shaquille O'Neal reportedly raved about his Harley-Davidson collection.
Williams first purchased a Yamaha R3 with a red-and-black frame, a nod to his new team's colors. His mother hated the idea of the bike. She put gum in the ignition and joked about throwing the motorcycle off a nearby cliff.
The day after he spoke to the campers, Williams went for that fateful ride, crashed into that pole, smashed his leg in pieces. The news spread fast. Collins thought back instantly to what Williams told the campers. Baluyot felt nauseated and went home sick. Williams's parents, who were in New Jersey, sped toward Chicago. Krzyzewski flew there on a private plane from Colorado, worried ''about Jason's recovery and, at a higher level, about him not being able to use his gift.''
Althea stepped into the intensive care unit and slapped her son's head.
She yelled, ''Boy, didn't I tell you not to ride that bike?''
A Team as a Family
Williams spent five weeks on his back, in intensive care, his leg propped up, hopped up on pain medication. There were no windows in the unit, only darkness and artificial light. One night, a nearby roof collapsed during a party, and Williams sat there, high and scared, as he listened to the screams. He hallucinated regularly. He once saw his father hovering over the bed and his mother near the ceiling.
The Bulls' front office helped Williams beyond its contractual obligations, with his medical bills and other expenses. It paid some of Williams's second-year salary, too. But his teammates in Chicago? Never heard from them.
''You're like, this has to be a movie, this has to be a dream,'' Williams said. ''I have to be tripping. There's no way this could happen to me. I'm too good of a guy.''
After the stint in intensive care, Williams flew back to Duke. He rented a house near the Krzyzewskis. The university surrounded her son like a ''cloaking device,'' Althea Williams said. ''Like something out of 'Star Trek.' ''
Krzyzewski stopped by occasionally, even assessed the form on Williams's jump shot once he got around to shooting again. Carlos Boozer flew back to hang out. Chris Duhon pushed Williams's wheelchair around. Mike Dunleavy Jr. sent text messages. Here was everything Krzyzewski talked about in college, a basketball team that doubled as a family. ''Wow,'' Williams thought, ''everything he preached to us was real.''
Williams did some type of physical therapy every day, often twice, for two years. His mother prayed at least that often. When he asked what if, she flipped the question. What if he had died? What if he had lost his leg? Gauvin, the physical therapist, took one look at that leg, all gnarled and scarred, and told Williams he was lucky the surgical team in Chicago had managed to save it below the knee.
While in therapy, Williams masked his depression, same as he did in public. He treated each session like a game, each repetition like a critical championship moment.
At first, Williams's knee bent very little. He could not squat, or ride a bicycle, or sit down without pushing the knee at an angle awkwardly in front of him. He worked on bending, on squatting, on flexibility.
Gauvin and the rest of the therapists taught Williams how to walk again. They broke it down, step by excruciating step: developing the strength and balance to stand upright, then the ability to accept weight on the injured leg, then the mechanics of taking an actual step. When Williams inched forward like a robot, still unsure of how to perform this most basic function, they told him to forget the details and remember his athleticism, to do what came naturally.
Williams learned to walk again. He learned to balance on one leg, to walk across a balance beam, to jump, skip, jog, run, sprint. He went from a wheelchair to a walker to two crutches to one crutch to no assistance. He redeveloped muscle tone. When he ran the steps at Duke's football stadium, he swelled with emotion as he thought about not only the work involved but the number of people it took to put him back together again: the therapists, doctors, surgeons and nurses; the friends and family members and coaches. A village, a team, another dream fulfilled.
Miraculous, Gauvin called it.
''There's no way we could ever appreciate the loss of function he sustained,'' Gauvin said. ''We could never function like Jason could. He was amazing. He is amazing. He will always be Jason who wrecked the motorcycle and ended his career. But he's also so much more than that.''
'Best Job in the World'
Williams steered his black Mercedes S550 toward the office, which, on this Saturday in December, happened to be Dean Smith Center, in nearby Chapel Hill.
''Good old Carolina,'' he said as he pulled onto campus, which sounded strange coming from Mr. Duke. ''I love this place. That old Carolina blue. It's so beautiful, man.''
That Williams starred for North Carolina's rival was not lost on the locals. As he prepared for an ESPN broadcast, they chided his purple shirt, which matched the color of that day's opponent, East Carolina. They asked for pictures and reminisced about old games, old plays, like the shot he swished from the Carolina logo near midcourt. One usher even called him ''Jay 'Carolina' Williams.'' He shook his head and smiled.
Williams talked basketball. He talked Atlantic Coast Conference basketball, Tar Heels basketball, national college basketball. He used the word ''platitude.'' He dropped a reference to the movie ''The Great White Hype.'' He traded jokes with the referees. He goofed around with the play-by-play announcer, Adam Amin, a Bulls fan.
As the game drew near, sweat showed under the armpits of that purple shirt. Williams sat forward, as if ready to play, in the front row but no longer on the court. ''Best job in the world, man,'' he said.
It took about six years for Williams to arrive there, at his next vocation, comfortable with himself. Like most players, he identified with basketball before he lost it, same as Clark Kellogg, another player turned analyst who ''shed many a tear when I stopped playing.'' Unlike Kellogg, Williams retired at 21, before his career had really started.
At first, Williams tried to return to the N.B.A. He did not attempt a comeback for the money. The Guy Who Threw It All Away had put some savings in the bank. Most of his initial contract, in fact, more than $3 million. He lived off his endorsement income from Adidas and Chevrolet and others in that first season.
The Nets granted Williams a tryout. One owner hooked Williams up with a Zen-master type who taught him crazy dances and yoga poses. The moment Williams stepped back on the court in an N.B.A. jersey, in training camp in 2006, provided what he called ''the happiest and saddest feeling of my life.'' Happiest because he made it back, from a wheelchair to the highest level, and there were moments when he felt and played and scored like his old, explosive self. Saddest because of how fleeting those flashes were.
Williams still processed the game in the same way. He saw an opponent with his right foot an inch higher than his left, and he knew to attack that right foot, to put his left shoulder into the defender's chest, knocking the defender off balance, clearing a path to the hoop. He could see that, but he could no longer react quickly enough to act out the visions in his head. He wore a bulky contraption on his left foot and a special shoe to keep his foot and toes from dragging.
He even joined the Austin Toros in the Development League, where his coach, Dennis Johnson, promised to get Williams back into the N.B.A. Then Williams tore his hamstring and ended up back in the hospital. While he was recovering, Johnson died of a heart attack.
''Dude, I'm done,'' Williams said of his mind-set then. ''I'm chasing a ghost. It's over.''
More depression. More drinking. More resentment. More self-loathing. All part of the search for what came next.
His grandmother died. So did his dog. His mother needed a new kidney, and he offered one of his without hesitation, until her assistant volunteered instead. She received the kidney in 2008, on Sept. 22, a date that matched his jersey number. He pushed her through rehabilitation.
''Did I sound like this?'' she asked.
He replied, ''Every day for five years, Mom.''
Williams spoke again at a Duke basketball camp, told his story, even about how he considered suicide, as tears welled in Krzyzewski's eyes. Williams walked onto the floor, aided by crutches, at Cameron Indoor Stadium, his jersey already hanging in the rafters. He mentored younger players. He focused on the run and not the way it ended.
''It's when he started to believe that there was more to Jason than his true love,'' Althea Williams said. ''And that was basketball. He doesn't want to be pigeonholed in his career now. He wants to do so many things. He doesn't realize he pigeonholed himself into basketball for all those years. He was so shallow in terms of who he really was.''
Eventually, Williams latched on with ESPN and ESPNU. His credentials appealed to the network, as did his potential as an analyst.
Jay Levy, ESPN's senior coordinating producer for men's college basketball, said Williams learned to slow down over the past few years, to let the broadcast breathe. Williams watched as much tape as when he played. He started to pitch interviews, which showed initiative for an analyst among ESPN's youngest, an analyst whose career goals include becoming the ''African-American Matt Lauer.''
''I hope people remind me of my accident every day of my life,'' Williams said. ''Because that means I'm a prime example of somebody who had it and lost everything and may not have gotten it back in the same capacity but still reinvented myself.''
At every game Williams has covered, someone -- another broadcaster, a producer, a fan -- inevitably asked some variation of the Question. Why did he get on that motorcycle? You threw it all away, they tell him.
To which Williams often responds, ''You're right.''
Focus on the Future
Jay Williams had a dream a few weeks back. He saw two small children, with frizzy hair, running toward him on a beach. One called him ''Papa.''
Williams is asked, if he had children, would he let them ride a motorcycle? He says he would, but he hopes they would choose not to.
His physical pain lingers, and when it is cold or damp outside, the knee creaks like an old wooden door. Sometimes, he asks his girlfriend, ESPN's Charissa Thompson, to simply rub the knee, the action a magic elixir that puts Williams right to sleep. He wears sandals indoors because of poor circulation. He takes longer to recover from workouts. He sometimes trips as he walks.
''He will deal with the decision he made to ride that motorcycle, the physical repercussions, for the rest of his life,'' Gauvin said. ''He will not wake up one day and be recovered.''
Which is true, but not necessarily evident on the basketball court. Williams was there on a weekday morning in December, inside Duke's practice facility, wearing a gray T-shirt darkened by his sweat. A black sleeve covered his left leg, not an inch of it exposed.
''Come watch me play basketball,'' Williams said as he motioned over a few visitors. ''People think that I can't walk.''
Williams controlled the tempo of the game, pushing and slowing the pace as he felt necessary. His jumpers -- feet a foot off the ground, arms fully extended, perfect follow-through -- dropped through the basket, one after another, as if this game took place in 2001, not 2012.
On some mornings, Krzyzewski will stumble upon one of these contests, and he will smile at the sight of his former protיgי and slip, if only for a moment, into ''Damn, what might have been.'' Same with Collins, now one of Williams's regular opponents.
''It makes me so happy to see him out there,'' Collins said. ''When I see Jason on the court, it reminds me how much he loved to play. Then later I'm in my office, and that thought just breaks my heart. Because there's no question, if he was healthy, he'd be one of the best guards in the N.B.A. right now.''
That afternoon, Williams took a quick spin through Duke's basketball museum, past all the reminders of what was. He did not stay there long. That star turn is over now, as if it happened in another lifetime, back when he ruled the world, before he decided to conquer it again.

With Wall,Wizards Think Unthinkable: Playoffs

BYLINE: By SCOTT CACCIOLA

SECTION: Section SP; Column 0; Sports Desk; Pg. 10

LENGTH: 739 words

WASHINGTON -- When the Wizards' John Wall was rehabilitating his injured left knee this season, he did what he could to stay involved with the team. He went to road games. He attended practice. He watched game film on a monitor whenever he climbed on the team's antigravity treadmill.
He did everything except play basketball. Although Wall's teammates could sometimes sense his impatience, he seemed determined to make his transition as seamless as possible once he returned to the court. 
It was a wise course. Led by their young point guard, the new-look Wizards are suddenly surging. So jubilant was the mood in the locker room after their most recent game, an 89-74 victory against the visiting Nets on Friday night, that Wall would not rule out reaching the postseason.
Forget that Washington, for all its improved play, remains 21 games below .500 at 14-35, far out of the playoff picture, entering Monday's game at Milwaukee. Among the N.B.A.'s longest-tenured doormats, the Wizards abound with optimism.
''We're finally trusting each other,'' said Wall, 22, a third-year player and former No. 1 draft pick out of Kentucky.
The victory was the Wizards' third straight, all against upper-echelon teams: the Los Angeles Clippers, the Knicks and the Nets. More surprising, Washington has won 9 of 16 games since Wall made his season debut Jan. 12. Without him, they were 5-28.
Wall, who is averaging 14.6 points, 7.1 assists and 3.2 rebounds, is the catalyst for everything the Wizards want to do: push the ball in transition, create turnovers in the halfcourt and swing passes around the perimeter.
''He challenges you as much as any point guard in the league,'' said Nets Coach P. J. Carlesimo, who compared Wall to Boston's Rajon Rondo, Oklahoma City's Russell Westbrook and San Antonio's Tony Parker. ''The ball is going to get from foul line to foul line quicker than it does against most other teams. It puts a lot of pressure on your team to get back, and it's not just the guy who's playing him. You need other people back.''
The Nets had trouble doing that. In Friday's game, the Wizards held a 16-6 advantage on fast-break points and shot 7 of 16 from 3-point range. Wall consistently found the sharpshooting forward Martell Webster, who was 3 of 5 from long range. And Webster got open looks because the veteran center Nene, who finished with 20 points and 11 rebounds, was clogging the paint. The Wizards proved hard to guard because they were multidimensional.
Webster, who is shooting a career-best 43.8 percent from 3-point range this season, gave Wall a lot of credit for staying focused while he was injured. It would have been understandable, he said, had Wall begun to feel irrelevant.
''You start to feel like there's nothing you can do to help contribute to the team,'' Webster said. ''But he stayed strong. That's the most important thing. The kid is very resilient.''
That style of play -- fast-paced, without much regard for his physical welfare -- has made a bold return in recent weeks. Wizards center Emeka Okafor said an injury-induced absence can help a player. Wall had no choice but to take a step back and analyze his situation.
Jerry Stackhouse, the Nets' 38-year-old swingman, has become something of a mentor to Wall. They grew up in the same region of North Carolina and developed a close relationship in 2010 as teammates in a summer pro-am league that Stackhouse runs in Raleigh. But their relationship did not blossom overnight. Wall, who was a rookie at the time, seemed eager to showcase his talent. Stackhouse was not particularly impressed.
''He was coming down every time, forcing shots, nobody else touching the ball -- and his teammates were wide open,'' said Stackhouse, one of those teammates. ''I was like, 'You have got to move the basketball.' He got a little upset and said something back to me.''
Stackhouse added, ''I was like, 'Who do you think you're talking to?' ''
He said he was still upset -- ''smoke coming out of my ears'' -- when Wall found him in the parking lot after the game. Wall apologized, and Stackhouse said that meant something to him. It was a sign that Wall, who had grown up in a tough Raleigh neighborhood, had the potential to lead.
These days, Wall is sharing the ball and making plays. Webster said the Wizards remained a close-knit unit even when Wall was watching from the bench. ''We were always having fun,'' Webster said. ''But now we have the wins to show for it.''

Working Stiffs

LENGTH: 911 words

Gene Kerrigan's new police procedural, THE RAGE (Europa, paper, $17), isn't your typical Irish crime novel with moody cops and colorful crooks who talk like poets and act like animals. The singular characters who go about their business in Dublin's crippled economy may be on opposite sides of the law, but in Kerrigan's book they're all working-class stiffs struggling to get by.
Everybody seems to have an opinion on the depressed state of the nation. ''The politicians fell in love with the smart fellas,'' according to an old union man, ''and in the end it was the smart fellas broke the country in pieces.'' That's pretty close to a midlevel gangster's view that ''the big boys got too greedy, ran everything off a cliff.'' 
It falls to public servants like Detective Sergeant Bob Tidey to keep this barely contained anger from getting out of hand, as it does when an unknown party guns down a banker named Emmet Sweetman in the hallway of his tastefully appointed mansion. In no time at all, people are tossing Molotov cocktails into banks and beating up financiers and real estate developers. While the Sweetman case hovers in limbo, Kerrigan sets in motion a criminal scheme that gives all the principals a chance to exercise their individual work ethics.
One key player in this drama is Vincent Naylor, a young ex-con with ambitions to better himself by being more selective about his crooked pursuits. (''The next time Vincent Naylor went to jail it would be for something worthwhile.'') It's a class thing with Vincent. He makes a point of robbing snobby stores that sell merchandise at inflated ''Celtic Tiger prices'' and figures that knocking off an armored security truck loaded with bank money would be almost patriotic. By the time Vincent's plan is good to go, he has acquired an extensive group of criminal associates -- and caught the eye of an ex-nun who knows trouble when she sees it.
Kerrigan's clean, spare style adapts smoothly to the striving characters who lend their many voices to this narrative. The crooks may be more direct in their language and clear about their goals than the morally ambivalent Tidey. What's more striking, though, is the similarity of their aspirations and the familiarity of their discontents. (Vincent actually has a healthier relationship with his live-in girlfriend than Tidey does with his ex-wife, sneaking in and out of her bed so he won't upset their children.)
Beneath the skin all these characters are underdogs, snarling with rage at being kicked too long by the crooked politicians, bankers and other looters who ran their country into the ground.
What a nightmare! Two bodies have been unearthed in your flower beds, and you have no idea how they got there. But cheer up -- the police might have dug up the body you personally planted at the edge of the wood.
That's the premise of THREE GRAVES FULL (Gallery, $24.99), Jamie Mason's ripping good novel about Jason Getty, who suffers a lifetime of bullying until the day he gives in to ''a howling primal rage'' and turns on his tormentor. Masochist that he is, Jason had invited the predatory Gary Harris into his life with no more thought than those silly virgins who open their bedroom windows to Dracula. But Gary's cruelty extends beyond the grave.
Mason has a witty and wicked imagination, yet she's also responsive to the pain of inarticulate people like Jason. Although he's become accustomed to sleeping in an empty bed, he's stirred by the sound of rustling sheets, ''the background music of not being alone.''
Small towns promise many things: security, tranquillity and a sense of community. But all it takes is an act of violence for a small town to take back those promises. That's what Nora Hamilton learns in Jenny Milchman's quietly unnerving novel, COVER OF SNOW (Ballantine, $26), when Nora's husband, Brendan, inexplicably hangs himself. Brendan was a popular member of his hometown police force in Wedeskyull, a rugged outpost in the Adirondack Mountains of upstate New York. But Nora will always be a stranger here, she realizes, when everyone stonewalls her efforts to uncover whatever secrets in her husband's past drove him to kill himself. Although the solution to these mysteries is too obvious to raise goose bumps, Milchman reveals an intimate knowledge of the psychology of grief, along with a painterly gift for converting frozen feelings into scenes of a forbidding winter landscape.
Despite claiming he's retired, Lawrence Block can't seem to resist taking a few swigs from the poisoned cup. HIT ME (Mulholland/Little, Brown, $26.99) brings back his most fatally appealing protagonist, the professional hit man known as Keller, last sighted in New Orleans with the newly acquired baggage of a wife, a baby and a construction business. Keller's passion for rare stamps leads him to take on a special assignment from his old booking agent, Dot, who has resurfaced in Sedona, Ariz. And soon enough, this imperfectly socialized killer is back in the game, taking contracts in cities like Dallas and New York, where a man can always find a good stamp auction. Aside from their ingenious methodology, what makes these amuse-bouches so delectable are the moral dilemmas Block throws up to deflect his philosophical antihero from a given task. Any assassin might hesitate to murder a child, but only Keller would ponder the ethics of killing someone whose premature death would rob a prostitute of payment for her professional services.

WE LIVE IN WATERStories
By Jess Walter177 pp. Harper Perennial. Paper, $14.99.
The men in Jess Walter's pungent new story collection, ''We Live in Water,'' are coming apart. These men -- and they are exclusively men, save a few catalytic female characters -- are what society (and ex-wives) commonly label disappointments. Trading in ill-considered choices, they have made a habit of letting folks down -- their women, their kids, their friends, their creditors and, chiefly, themselves. Walter's protagonists endure a buffet of self-inflicted misfortune, everything from meth addiction to dodgy parenting, often served in a combo platter with a side of unlucky in love. His characters are all searching, with varying levels of commitment and insight. None succeed. 
Instead, after years of deflecting criticism and judgment in favor of ego puffing, serial infidelities and soothing, mind-addling chemical baths, they finally hit the wall of recognition when it is too late -- their girl is gone for good, their son eyes them with intractable pity, they are about to be beaten to death and tossed in a lake. Unlike what one is taught in therapy, their aha moments bring little comfort or joy. No one in Walter's stories is made whole by epiphany. No one rushes out and buys an elliptical trainer or bran flakes. When self-awareness comes, as it does for a recovering addict named Bit in the opening story, ''Anything Helps,'' it offers only more gristle to choke down.
''Why can't we be the things that we see and think? Why do we always have to be these sad stories?'' Bit laments in group, still clinging to his survivalist, alcoholic charm. At the end, after an enervating exchange with his estranged pubescent son, now living in foster care with well-meaning but simple Christians, Bit's enlightenment leaves him longing for death, believing all anyone becomes is ''a twitching bunch of memories and mistakes, regrets.''
All of which is to say, this is not ''Beautiful Ruins'' -- more just ruin; beauty here is something for suckers. Not that the book is a downer. Well, maybe a little. But that's only because Walter is unflinching and, possibly, a bit depressed, which is what happens to any compassionate, reasonable person who stares too closely at the world. (As Walter does to captivating effect in ''Statistical Abstract for My Hometown, Spokane, Washington,'' which juxtaposes a running bit about bike theft with gut-punching observations about poverty and spousal abuse.) Walter makes you laugh, then makes you feel a little queasy about it. This is the alchemy of the damned.
Any wisdom, when it comes, comes from children -- or rather, from the loss of their innocence and our observation of it. We see children in dire straits, children of tweakers, gamblers and other fallen men, and then we see what becomes of these kids when they too have grown, and reached, and failed.
Wade, a white-collar criminal sentenced to a pilot program tutoring second graders and sophomores, must read the same book every time to his student Drew, a waif with no healthy male role models in his impecunious life.
''Don't you want to bring another book?'' Wade asks.
Drew demurs, says he doesn't know what's in those other books.
''Isn't that the fun, finding out?''
Drew remains dubious. He knows better. How for most of the planet, ''finding out'' is rarely fun. How when life is at its harshest, knowing exactly what the ending will be counts more than a hot dinner.
The last five pages of the book Wade reads to Drew contain no words. They are, Walter writes, the pages the boy likes best.
It is a moment of exquisite empathy. The stillness of the scene, a child safe on a man's lap, transported, if only for a few minutes, is devastating. It calls to mind both the unparalleled power of stories and their limitations. (Few are the writers who appreciate how, not just for some things but for most things that matter, there are no words.)
Walter provides a few respites from the enticing murk. The naןve stalker in ''Virgo'' who alters horoscopes to manipulate his lover's moods is funny and pitiful, as is the narrator of the zombie apocalypse romp, ''Don't Eat Cat,'' who rightfully declaims: ''Sure, the world seems crazy now. But wouldn't it seem just as crazy if you were alive when they sacrificed peasants, when people were born into slavery, when they killed firstborn sons . . . '' And on and on, summarizing, ''Maybe it's always the end of the world.''
This is funny because it's true, and horrible because it's true, and funny because it's horrible, and so on, forever.
Fortunately, Walter is a bighearted man who excels at writing about other bighearted, if broken, men. That generosity of spirit, coupled with Walter's seeming inability to look away from the messy bits, elevates these stories from dirges to symphonies. For Walter, we do live in water, an immense soup of muddled humanity sloshing around and spilling over, soaking us all. Everything is a reflection of everything else, with no such thing as disconnection. Or isolation. Or edges. Or solid ground.
''Whole worlds exist beneath the surface,'' thinks the lost son in the title story as he stares into a still lake. ''And maybe you can't see down there . . . but there's a part of you that knows.''
Walter does see down there. He understands that no matter how often we insist we won't be able to live with ourselves, we really have no other choice. It's sink or swim.

OUT OF THE EASYBy Ruta Sepetys
346 pp. Philomel Books. $17.99. (Young adult; ages 14 and up)
As a girl, I was obsessed with prostitutes. The hookers I saw on television wore silk kimonos and had cigarettes permanently attached to their lips -- mean on the outside but like bruised baby birds on the inside. My experiences baby-sitting showed me I wasn't the only girl interested in a so-called life of sin. At 12, I once picked up a daisy-covered address book, to find only one entry, under P, Prostitute, followed by a list of massage parlor numbers. 
Josie Moraine, the heroine of Ruta Sepetys's ''Out of the Easy,'' set in 1950 New Orleans, is a prostitute's daughter. Right away, this marks the book as different from the author's highly acclaimed first young adult novel, ''Between Shades of Gray,'' which told the story of a 15-year-old Lithuanian confined to Stalin's labor camps. This new book opens in a fancy hotel, where Josie's mother, Louise, retreats with a john, leaving Josie, then 7, to sleep in the lobby. Soon her mother, a bad seed if ever there was one, is working as one of Willie Woodley's ''nieces'' in the city's French Quarter. The house interior is all dark brocade, black crystal chandeliers and paintings of women with exposed pink nipples.
Josie, spirited and smart, prefers the local bookstore, where she hangs around so often that the owner, Charlie, gives her a room in the attic when she is 11. This retreat does not protect her completely. Men still leer, offering money for her virginity and asking her to wear high heels. Josie's days are equal parts sacred and profane. At night she reads E. M. Forster, and in the mornings, using rubber gloves, she cleans the bordello.
The novel centers on a murder. A bookstore customer is killed late on the night of his visit, and Josie's mother may or may not be involved. While the plot points are initiated mostly by men -- Louise's gangster boyfriend, Cincinnati; the mobster Tangle Eye; and the boss Carlos Marcello -- the heart of ''Out of the Easy'' is its women. The bordello's inhabitants are predictably lovable: Sweety, a ''quadroon girl,'' lives with her grandmother and washes her sheets herself. Dora, a buxom redhead, wears only green. Josie finds her ''snoring in a collapsed bed with a melted ice pack between her legs.'' Evangeline, the solitary mean one, is a kleptomaniac who dresses up for a john in schoolgirl braids. Josie's mother is no real mother at all, coming to ''parent day'' naked underneath a full-length fur coat, stealing her daughter's college savings and worst of all, urging her boyfriend to rob and beat Josie's champion, Charlie.
Only the madam, Willie, mothers Josie, showing up at her graduation, giving her a gold watch for her 18th birthday, offering to pay her college tuition (but only if she goes to school in New Orleans, not at Smith, which she'd like to attend). Willie is also an excellent shot, keeping her guns hidden in a golf bag. Sepetys based Willie on Norma Wallace, the last great madam of the French Quarter. Wallace was born into poverty but rose to become an underworld force in New Orleans for more than four decades.
A lot happens in ''Out of the Easy.'' Besides the murder, Josie finds out her co-worker Patrick, the boy she has a crush on, is gay. She befriends Charlotte, a Smith student who shows her the upper echelons of New Orleans life. In the book's final movement, all hell breaks loose. Cops raid Willie's house. Louise slips town, leaving her daughter saddled with a mob debt. Fearing for her own life and for those she loves, Josie realizes she may have to get into the game and give up on her dreams. Sepetys writes these scenes with rawness and palpable emotional unease; most daughters fear they will become like their mothers, but for the daughters of prostitutes the stakes are momentous.
While ''Out of the Easy'' is a satisfying novel, bringing to life the midcentury French Quarter, and Josie is beguiling when relating details of her world backstage at the cathouse, the gangsters are mostly flat and their interactions with Josie one-dimensional. Similarly, Willie and her nieces teeter perilously close to the clichי of the hooker with a heart of gold. I worry, given the allure of the subject for girls, that Sepetys softens the sadness and complexity of prostitution.
Josie wants more for herself. She is smart, but her intelligence does not automatically free her from social confines. Like every young woman, Josie must negotiate a world where her body is valued over her mind. Her awareness of this difficult position may be what helps her get out of the Easy and into life.

Leaving the Man Cave Hand in Hand, Laugh by Laugh

Pamela Taylor and Eames Yates were married in Snowmass, Colo., in 2006, a few days after a howling September snowstorm. Yet the wedding took place outside as planned, in a grove of evergreen trees, with 200 shivering guests.
The rogue wind and snow seemed appropriate for Mr. Yates, a documentary filmmaker and avid fisherman and hunter who does not abide any whining or complaining, especially about weather-related discomforts.
Ms. Taylor, then 50, was an openly ecstatic first-time bride, while Mr. Yates, also 50 at the time, was openly ambivalent -- not about Ms. Taylor, whom he said he loved so much he had trouble breathing without her, but about marriage. He had been divorced once and since then had lived alone in a Manhattan apartment decorated with snakeskins, animal skulls, mounted fish and a bear rug, as well as assorted teeth, claws and feathers. Nothing seemed to scare him except marrying again, which scared him a lot. ''I was a rugged individual, against the world,'' he said. ''I didn't want to let anybody in.''
So, how has six-plus years of married life been? ''Everything I feared has happened,'' he said, sort of laughing. 
For one thing, his home no longer resembles a cave. He and Ms. Taylor, both now 56, have moved to a pretty, light-filled apartment on West 57th Street. ''The rawhide has given way to chintz,'' he said. And the apartment is often full of live, talkative people rather than silent skulls. Ms. Taylor, who is tall and vivacious, a human sparkler, loves entertaining. ''There are more social soirees in my own home than I ever imagined,'' Mr. Yates said. ''There's more laughter and gaiety, happy people enjoying themselves. I'm starting to understand that's a good thing.''
He added, ''The greatest change is the loss of silence.''
Physically, he's a changed man as well. Ms. Taylor described Mr. Yates's physique at the time of the wedding this way: ''He's like a rhino. He looks big but he's fast as hell.''
The rhino has had to slow down a bit. ''As soon as I got married, my entire body broke down,'' Mr. Yates said.
First, he tore his quadriceps tendon getting out of a cab. That required surgery and a long rehabilitation. ''That was one of my early wedding presents to Princess,'' he said, referring to Ms. Taylor's nickname. ''Then I got carpal tunnel syndrome from typing so much, and my arms were in casts with my hands straight up. You can imagine how much Princess loved that.''
Not long after the casts came off, he was driving in the country and hit two deer and a tree, crushing his shoulder. ''It's almost like as soon as you get married, it's all right to break down,'' he said.
Ms. Taylor nursed him in her own way, with a mix of devotion and humor. ''He learned about love,'' she said. ''He never really thought someone would actually be there. He was so self-reliant, bulletproof, for so long.''
Mr. Yates said: ''When you're absolutely humbled, physically humbled, you truly appreciate those who are willing to take you on. You've got to really love someone to take care of them when they can't take care of themselves. Maybe that's what love is all about.''
In their apartment, weekday mornings usually begin the same way: he serves her breakfast in bed (if he's not injured), then she rushes off to work as the executive director of the Bocuse d'Or USA Foundation, an organization that promotes community as well as competition among chefs.
The couple has a weekend home in Dutchess County, an old train station that they renovated and decorated together. They are both hoarders, though of different things. ''I've got antique linens, old family photos in silver frames, contemporary art,'' she said. ''He's got bear rugs, a tufted warthog, the stuffed baboon, the skulls and badger skins.''
Dinner is, like the couple, a combination of stylish and just-back-from-the-wilderness. Often, she said, it is ''something Eames has caught, served on family silver.''
She doesn't hunt or enjoy camping on the Alaskan tundra, so they often go separate ways for longer trips. ''I give him free rein to do all of his adventures, and I'm allowed to do my own adventures,'' she said. ''Eames will take off for a week on a shooting expedition, and I'll go to Art Basel in Miami. He has no idea what that is. He'll say, 'Who is Art Basel? I feel like I know him.' ''
Mr. Yates's stepfather, Mike Wallace, the television newsman, and his mother, Mary Yates Wallace, both died last year after long illnesses. (Mr. Yates's father, Ted Yates, was killed in Jerusalem in 1967 while covering the Six-Day War for NBC; he and Mr. Wallace had been colleagues.)
While Mr. Yates once shuddered at the idea of a girlfriend hanging a dress in his closet, he now shudders at the idea of growing old without company. ''When you experience the aging process in your parents, you do not want to go through that alone,'' he said.
His mother, a longtime documentary filmmaker and television producer, spent the last two months of her life in bed, often watching movies or talking with Mr. Yates and Ms. Taylor. ''Eames would sit there by the bed and hold her hand and tell her how much he loved her and how great she'd been as a mom,'' Ms. Taylor said. ''I was a ruin just listening to it.''
After his mother died, he shaved his bushy beard and cut his long, unruly hair. Like a snake, he was shedding his old self. ''I've heard it said that a man is born twice in this life, once when your mother brings you into the world and once when she leaves you behind in death,'' he said. ''I do feel this is a rebirth. It's now the rest of my life with Pam.''
He said he would have had a very different reaction to the deaths if not for Ms. Taylor. ''I would have gone to the funerals and then gone deep into the bush on safari,'' he said. ''I would have retreated. With Pam, we really did well by both Mike and Mary. There was a lot of demand for us being front and center, and Pam rose to the challenge and held my hand through the whole thing.''
In the midst of so many injuries and funerals, Ms. Taylor and Mr. Yates still laugh -- a lot.
''He's very funny,'' she said. ''He makes me laugh all the time. No matter what's going on, I know I can always count on Eames for laughter. It's literally a belly laugh. No one makes me laugh like that.''Last month, Mr. Yates underwent surgery to repair three herniated disks and Ms. Taylor became a devoted nurse again, albeit a footloose one. A few days after the operation she left for a Bocuse d'Or chef competition in Lyon, France.
''The magic of marriage is that four old arms are better than two,'' Mr. Yates said from his bed. ''Your chances of survival are better.''
He sometimes still has trouble believing that he is actually married. ''I had a tremendous fear of intimacy,'' he said. ''That's the bane of every man's existence. I'm still running from that, but the gap is closing.''
Asked if he was afraid that this marriage would also fail, he said: ''No, the fear is that it's going to last, that you're in it for the long haul. Pam and I are really good. I still can't believe it. It's like: 'This is really working. What's that all about? Are you kidding me?' ''
THROUGH THE YEARS
Then Pamela Taylor and Eames Yates met on a blind date. They were married on Sept. 23, 2006, in Snowmass, Colo.
Appeared in Vows Oct. 1, 2006
Now ''The magic of marriage,'' Mr. Yates said, ''is that four old arms are better than two.''

Gobbled Up by a Great Lawn

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY

SECTION: Section RE; Column 0; Real Estate Desk; STREETSCAPES; Pg. 8

LENGTH: 782 words

You don't need a lot of snow, just the lightest dusting around the Great Lawn in Central Park, to see a remnant of old New York. If the wind is right, the snow catches on a long, mysterious ridge on the east side, leading north to a strange half-pyramid of stone. These are the traces of the long-gone 1842 Yorkville Reservoir.
It stood just south of the present kidney-shaped reservoir in the park. A huge rectangle, it had sloping walls and a flat strip along the top 18 feet wide. To keep people off this potential promenade, it was guarded by a fierce-looking double row of picket fences. 
When water began to fill the Yorkville Reservoir, which was up to 34 feet deep, on June 27, 1842, The New York Spectator was there to describe the sound of the inflow as ''a sweet soothing murmur.'' The Spectator reported that ''every stage, cab and coach in the city'' was engaged to take celebrants to the opening ceremony at an out-of-town destination in the middle of a streetless wilderness. Soldiers lining the wall placed their caps on the end of their bayonets and gave ''six hearty cheers.'' There was also a 38-gun salute, one for each mile of the aqueduct that brought the water from Croton Reservoir.
In 1861 Harper's Weekly allowed as how the contents formed ''a noble sheet of water,'' but the magazine was not impressed with its walls of ''ponderous masonry'' and concluded that the reservoir offered ''but slight picturesque attraction.''
By that time the construction of Central Park was under way, and Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, the designers, chafed at the hulking 1842 reservoir; they designed the one to the north with a picturesque, undulating pedestrian path open to sightseers.
But their reservoir also attracted suicides, whereas the double-barreled fencing around what began to be called the lower reservoir rarely did. Perhaps that was because drowning was preferable to the fate of a man in 1882 who, barred from the walls of the lower reservoir, jumped from the top of Belvedere Castle at the southwest corner. Instead of hitting the water he fell to the ground, and was ''horribly mangled,'' according to The New York Times.
By 1895, The New York World had decided the lower reservoir was ''an eyesore'' and endorsed a plan sure to liven things up: a ''bicycle speedway'' around the top, where ''wheelmen could let themselves out at their top speed, unhampered by laws and ordinances.'' The World foresaw no possible conflict with the sightseers who would share the path, saying that ''there are 90,000 bicyclers who would delight in it.''
But the speedway did not come to pass, and the 90,000 remained on the streets, where they were frequently decried as menace.
With more aqueduct construction the Central Park reservoirs became less essential, and the lower one, especially, attracted a growing number of replacement proposals: an exhibition hall, a stadium, a parking lot, swimming and wading pools. Finally the design for the Great Lawn was approved, and in the early 1930s the interior of the reservoir was filled with construction debris, and the walls partly demolished.
Anyone of an archaeological inclination can make a circuit of this subterranean public work, starting with the ladies' room entrance of the restroom building next to the Delacorte Theater.
Head north perhaps 200 feet, crossing the paved pathway to a sign explaining the history of the Great Lawn.
At its base, stretching away a few feet and exposed by erosion, is part of the sloping wall of the west face of the reservoir. It stretches north underground to the back of the police station on the 86th Street Transverse Road. There, part of the north wall, perhaps 15 feet high, is used as a retaining wall for a parking lot. On the east side of the police station, just beyond the north end of the basketball courts, a large corner section of the reservoir, the walls crudely repointed with white cement, pokes out of the earth.
Finally, along the east side of the Great Lawn, just outside the big oval walk, a north-south hummock over the eastern reservoir wall runs for a few hundred feet. The earth has been worn down, and isolated stones rise out of the ground in a rough north-south line.
Under the right conditions, they catch the drifting snow and present the shadow of a lost water-world from nearly two centuries ago.
It's not clear how much of this wall remains, but at least 10 or 12 feet on the west side must survive under the dirt. Were it scooped out, revealing the remains of the great sloping wall, it would form a suitable base for a platoon of troops, caps on bayonets, and a 38-gun salute to one of the great public works in New York history.

CHICAGO -- By the hundreds, mourners filed into the pews of a packed church on this city's South Side on Saturday, clutching one another, weeping and wearing buttons adorned with the smiling face of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old girl whose death has come to represent the miserable cost of gun and gang violence.
''She is a representative not just of the people in Chicago, she is a representative of people across this nation who have lost their lives,'' said Damon Stewart, Ms. Pendleton's godfather, as he urged people not to politicize her death.
An array of Washington officials -- the first lady, Michelle Obama; Arne Duncan, the education secretary; and Valerie Jarrett, a senior White House adviser -- were among dignitaries seated in the front row. Ms. Pendleton, a member of her high school's majorette team, traveled to Washington to perform during President Obama's inauguration festivities only a week before she was fatally shot here. 
Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who has met with the girl's family and spoken emotionally of her dreams for her future, attended, too, as did Gov. Patrick J. Quinn, who had alluded to Ms. Pendleton in his State of the State address.
As an emerging national debate about firearms has focused largely on mass shootings in places like Newtown, Conn., Ms. Pendleton's death last month became a symbol for a different element of gun violence -- urban and often overlooked or quickly forgotten. Ms. Pendleton, a student at King College Prep High School, was shot Jan. 29 as she sat after school in a park, about a mile from Mr. Obama's Chicago home, with friends -- a group that the police say was probably mistakenly swept up in the cross-fire of a gang fight.
In Chicago, people said they viewed the sudden flood of attention on Ms. Pendleton as a needed shift in the consciousness of the nation's third-largest city, which experienced more than 500 homicides in 2012, many of them from gun violence, and 46 more deaths since the start of 2013. If the city had grown inured at times to the stories of gang-related shootings, largely on the South and West Sides, Ms. Pendleton's death appeared -- at least for now -- to have reawakened many people, even those in more upscale neighborhoods away from the worst of the violence and far beyond Chicago.
So many people, including some who said they had never met Ms. Pendleton personally, had felt drawn to her funeral that space in the sanctuary and in an overflow room ran out and scores had to be turned away.
''It should be a tipping point,'' Andre Smith, head of Chicago Against Violence, a local group aimed at preventing neighborhood violence, said Friday, as he and scores of others attended a visitation for Ms. Pendleton, whom he had not known. ''I just hope that it's not here today and gone tomorrow.''
In the days since Ms. Pendleton's killing, a debate had ensued here over what the White House response should be. Some, including the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson and local newspaper editorial boards, had urged Mr. Obama to appear at the girl's funeral.
Some said he needed to draw the same attention to violence in his hometown and to the complicated urban questions of poverty, joblessness and gangs that he had given earlier to the mass shootings in Connecticut and elsewhere. Others, though, said that a White House presence would only politicize the funeral of a young girl and create a needless media spectacle, even as scores of other Chicagoans had died in violence here with little notice at all.
Asked why Mr. Obama, who is expected to address gun restrictions in his State of the Union address on Tuesday, had chosen not to attend Ms. Pendleton's funeral, his spokesman pointed out late last week that Mrs. Obama and others from the administration would attend.
''I think that represents the feeling that the president and the first lady both have about what happened to her and the tragedy that it represents both in real concrete terms to her family but also symbolically because of the tragedy of gun violence that our country has to deal with all too often,'' the spokesman, Jay Carney, said. Displayed on the back of a glossy funeral program for Ms. Pendleton was a copy of a handwritten note from the president to Ms. Pendleton's parents, which read, in part: ''We know that no words from us can soothe the pain, but rest assured that we are praying for you, and that we will continue to work as hard as we can to end this senseless violence. God Bless, Barack Obama.''
Family members of Ms. Pendleton said they were touched and honored that Mrs. Obama, who has lived on the South Side of Chicago, attended the service and met privately with family members and about 30 of her friends and classmates beforehand. Mrs. Obama made no public remarks during the three-and-a-half-hour funeral, nor did the elected officials here.
''She has daughters,'' said Shatira Wilks, a cousin of Ms. Pendleton's. ''She understands She's not being intrusive. It's not about her being seen.''
For Ms. Pendleton's family, the gathering was not about politics, but about Hadiya. Friends and family described the girl, who had once appeared in a video aimed at discouraging children from joining gangs, as a sweet and cheerful young woman who twirled batons on the majorette team, was considering going to college to become a journalist or pharmacist, and favored Chinese food, cheeseburgers, ice cream and Fig Newtons. Images of Ms. Pendleton flashed on a screen and filled the program book -- a tiny child wrapped in a baby blanket, a girl propped on the Easter Bunny's lap, a teen, smiling widely, with Washington landmarks in the background.
One by one, high school friends stepped shakily to a microphone to tell of a girl with a trademark, room-warming smile, the one who forgot her baton from time to time but always remembered her lip gloss, the one who whispered the right answers to them in chemistry class. Many pleaded for an end to violence. ''It's sad,'' one girl said, reading a poem for her dead friend, ''that you have to watch your front while watching your back.''
Around 2:30 p.m. on Jan. 29, Ms. Pendleton walked with friends to Harsh Park in the North Kenwood neighborhood. As the group huddled under a canopy as it began to rain, a man suddenly approached, jumped a fence, ran toward the group, and began shooting.
The police believe that the man mistook the group for members of a gang. Ms. Pendleton, who the police say was an unintended target with no ties to gangs, was shot in the back. By Saturday, no arrests had been made in the case.
Ms. Pendleton's mother, Cleopatra, rose to the microphone at one point, not far from her daughter's coffin. She thanked family members and the crowded room for what she described as an amazing outpouring of support, then grew quieter.
''You don't know everything,'' she said. ''You don't know how hard this really is. And those of you who do know how hard this is, I'm sorry. No mother, no father should ever have to experience this.''

I'm Begging, Don't Hack the Hacks

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

SECTION: Section SR; Column 0; Editorial Desk; OP-ED COLUMNIST; Pg. 11

LENGTH: 793 words

WASHINGTON
I SPENT a long time looking at W.'s sprezzatura in the shower, the play of light and shadow on his muscular back, and his face winsomely reflected in the shaving mirror.
I gazed at the former president's legs and toes in the bathtub, overcome with relief that W. was now under the influence of Lucian Freud rather than Dick Cheney.
Images of W.'s tasteful nude self-portraits went viral after being published on the Smoking Gun Web site on Thursday; they were stolen from his sister Doro's e-mail account by a hacker called Guccifer, who is now being investigated by the Secret Service for pillaging three years of Bush family e-mail. 
Congress and the news media are engaged in a febrile debate about the way America has used torture and drones, trying to figure out if the war on terror launched by W. got out of control and warped our sense of right and wrong. In the midst of this cacophony on morality, W. himself seems to have escaped to a simpler, more solipsistic landscape, making illustrations of his illustrious torso.
We are not talking Bonnard-level nude bath paintings. But, like W.'s charming oil portrait of Barney, signed ''43,'' which he released himself when his dog died recently, the pictures were surprisingly interesting and humanizing.
The way the artist uses light on surfaces, the sun coming through a fabric shade and hitting the water in the bathtub, is quite deft, as are his brush strokes and his use of a ''Rokeby Venus''-style face in the mirror.
The man can handle a brush. And we thought he could only clear brush. The president who came across as a paint-by-numbers executive in public life can actually paint in private life.
It's weird because W.'s presidency was not a reality-based undertaking; it did not look carefully at the world. And yet his paintings reflect meticulous optical observation.
As president (where he also showed sprezzatura), W. was led by Cheney and Rummy. But as a painter, he savors his own perspective.
The Smoking Gun reported that Guccifer infiltrated the e-mail of Doro Bush and several family friends, collecting cellphone numbers, security codes, photos -- including ones of the paintings and another of the first President Bush in the hospital -- and e-mails, including one by Jeb Bush about how his father helped restore Bill Clinton's ''sordid reputation.''
It was a week for worrying about the dark side of our cool, fast, exciting, heedless new technologies.
We are so dizzy and intoxicated by our new toys -- from iPhones to drones -- that we are hopelessly addicted to them before we fully understand the downsides.
The instant gratification they offer makes us shortsighted in an unprecedented way. It's insane how vulnerable we've made ourselves, like drunks failing to look around as they walk into traffic. Hackers could shut down the way we live, and if they hacked into drones or nuclear codes, determine the way we die. If you think it through, which most of us avoid, the prospect of Techmaggedon is terrifying.
On Thursday, at John Brennan's confirmation hearing to be C.I.A. director, some senators took a stab at thinking it through on the smart, sleek, robotic machine that dominates our political debate. (Drones, not Obama.)
Those who battled Cheney's nefarious efforts to obliterate constitutional checks and balances and practice pre-emption can't look the other way when a Democratic president is caught up in the narcotic allure of drones and pre-emption. You sell a little bit of the democratic soul when you start zapping people with no due process.
The Chinese, who have already broken into the White House computer network, have now pilfered, maybe spear-phished, oceans of e-mails from The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post.
With the Chinese stockpiling our vile, vexed, vulgar, vivacious and vinous e-mails, they can trounce us easily. They can simply threaten to release a batch of our e-bombs about our bosses, spouses, dates, friends and crushes. We'll all lose our jobs, but everyone else will, too, so we can just reboot and change places.
It's already too late to stop sending embarrassing e-missives, with a decade worth of hand grenades out there rolling around.
Just as Obama knows in his heart that, while seductive, drones need limits, so we know that, while seductive, e-mails need limits -- because sooner or later, the Chinese or some bitter hacker in his basement or some 10-year-old kid is going to make all our titillating e-mails public.
The rule of thumb in Washington used to be: Don't do anything that you wouldn't want to see printed on the front page of The New York Times. The new rule is: Don't send an e-mail you wouldn't want to see printed on the front page of The New York Times. (Especially if you work here.)

Sisterhood's Keeper

BYLINE: Interview by ANDREW GOLDMAN

SECTION: Section MM; Column 0; Magazine Desk; TALK; Pg. 12

LENGTH: 639 words

Terrible things happen to your characters. Your new book, ''The Storyteller,'' features a woman in Auschwitz. Past characters have included victims of a school shooting and parents of kids born with horrible diseases. Is it a little sadistic to put your characters through all this? I don't think I'm sadistic. I'm superstitious. There's a part of me that illogically believes if I write about a child with cancer, then my kids are going to be safe. If I write about a school shooting, it won't happen where we live. If I write about infidelity, then my marriage is going to be safe. Of course it does not work that way, and I know that.
So there's actually a neurosis behind this? Oh, gosh, of course there is. 
What did you, an author of serial No. 1 best sellers, make of ''50 Shades of Grey''? E. L. James has been upfront about the fact that this was ''Twilight'' fan fiction. As a writer, I find it pretty reprehensible that someone who began a story cycle with somebody else's created characters would go on to make gobs of money off those characters simply by slapping new names on them. Honestly, if I were Stephenie Meyer, I wouldn't have been that gracious.
You have bristled when others have labeled you a chick-lit author. I don't mind the term ''chick lit.'' I don't happen to write it, so I think it's funny when people assume I do just because I happen to have a vagina. It would be news to the 47 percent of people who write me fan mail who happen to be men to find out that I write chick lit.
But the cover of this book is obviously marketed to women. I agree. But I have learned to trust that the marketing departments know what they're doing. When 60 percent of book buyers are women, you can't fault a publisher for targeting that audience.
You're leaving your longtime publisher Simon & Schuster for Random House. Why? A lot of reasons. I have great relationships with people at Simon & Schuster. I'm not leaving in a huff, and I'm not upset at anybody. I just needed to try something new to reach a new level.
A new level of sales? It's not necessarily sales; it's recognition. There's a handful of what I would call the brand-name authors. Patterson, Evanovich. That's where I would like to head.
Whenever people have asked you what's the worst book you've read, you've consistently said ''The Notebook,'' by Nicholas Sparks. Aren't you afraid you're going to bump into him? One of the reasons that I say what I say about Nicholas Sparks is because I have bumped into him.
What happened? No way. I'm not going into that. But my feeling about ''The Notebook'' is that it's a terrific story poorly told.
Certain people in the literary community have said that because you write a book every year like clockwork, your process must be less creative. I've heard the word ''formulaic'' come up when people criticize my books. Why? Because I have a trial in many of my books. I don't know that John Grisham is called formulaic very often, so it is kind of interesting.
In 2010, you were critical of this paper because it reviewed Jonathan Franzen's ''Freedom'' twice in one week, which you found unsurprising because he is a ''white male literary darling.'' It took me by surprise when that blew up. I didn't feel like I was saying something that everyone didn't already know, that women are reviewed less frequently and differently than men and there are fewer female reviewers.
Who do you think should have been reviewed instead? A woman who writes genre commercial fiction would be great, even better if it's a woman of color. I don't have anyone in mind.
During the Franzen kerfuffle, you mentioned you hadn't read his book. Did you ever get to it? I read about half of it, and then I stopped.
Oh, yeah? Yeah. I thought, O.K., I got it. I've been here before. I remember ''The Corrections.'' I liked ''The Corrections'' better.

4 Shot During Argument on Bourbon Street

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

SECTION: Section ; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 

LENGTH: 286 words

NEW ORLEANS -- Four people were wounded in gunfire on the city's famed Bourbon Street as a costumed crowd partied amid the countdown to Mardi Gras, sending people running, the police and bystanders said. 
Four shots were fired Saturday night, followed by screams, a video taken by a bystander and released by the police showed. The authorities said an argument involving some of those in the crowd led up to the shooting. No arrests were immediately reported and the police said they were seeking three men.
Those wounded included a man who was shot in the abdomen, thigh and pelvis along with another man and two women, a spokesman for the New Orleans Police, Frank B. Robertson, said. His statement said the others were also hit by gunshots: the man in the buttocks, one woman on the chin and right foot and the other on a toe.
The police had said late Saturday that the most severely wounded man was in critical condition and undergoing surgery while the others were stable. They did not give their names or ages.
The shooting came on the last weekend of partying before Mardi Gras, the Fat Tuesday celebration that is the signature tourist event of the year in New Orleans.
New Orleans has been plagued for years by violent crime, including gun violence that has soared since Hurricane Katrina devastated the city in 2005.
The bystander's video shows many people on the street in costumes before the shooting, a number of them apparently unaware of what is unfolding.
The police said two men initially were arguing with the man now in critical condition. According to the police, two of the people involved pulled back after the argument, but one of them returned with a third man and the shooting erupted and then they fled.

In Connecticut Replay, Storm Comes, Power Goes

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME and ELIZABETH MAKER; Robert Davey contributed reporting from Bridgeport, Conn., and Thomas Kaplan from New York.

NEW HAVEN -- Few of the people parading around the streets with snow shovels on Sunday needed any reminder of the region's string of natural disasters in recent years: Hurricanes Irene and Sandy, and a rare pre-Halloween snowstorm.
But as parts of the state dug out from three feet or more of snow, there was no avoiding it.
In Old Lyme, Conn., Beth Hamilton and her husband, Matthew Barrett, were among 80 percent of the town who lost power on Friday night. They were still without power on Sunday night.
''We lost power in both of the hurricanes -- for five days during Irene, and six days during Sandy. So we're not having a lot of luck,'' said Ms. Hamilton, the mother of four children from age 3 to 16. ''Last night, it got down to zero degrees. It was brutal.'' She added, ''If we ever do make it through this, the first thing we'll do is buy a generator.'' 
Connecticut was hardly alone in being buried in the snow, but it seemed to suffer the worst of the storm. While much of the prestorm concerns centered on Eastern Massachusetts, no area was hit harder than Connecticut, where the town of Hamden took top snowfall honors: 40 inches.
Five of the 11 deaths attributed to the storm in the Northeast occurred in Connecticut. By Sunday evening, Connecticut Light and Power said it had restored service to more than 60,000 customers. Fewer than 7,000 customers remained without power, most of them in the southeastern corner of the state.
President Obama signed a disaster declaration for Connecticut, the fifth such instance in the two-plus years Dannel P. Malloy has been governor, a wearying tape loop of natural chaos -- with tragedies like the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in December and the previous year's fatal Christmas Eve fire in Stamford added to the mix -- that seems a long way from the state's traditional reputation as the low-drama ''Land of Steady Habits.''
''You learn from each of these but I think it's time for some other governor to learn,'' Mr. Malloy said in an interview on Sunday.
Mr. Malloy said the State Police had responded to some 400 accidents since the storm, with three dozen resulting in injuries. State officials also had received reports of a half-dozen roof collapses.With communities largely paralyzed by unplowed streets and stalled motorists, residents in Hamden, East Haven, New Haven and West Haven were warned to stay home Monday. Major employers have announced they will be closed. In some areas in the eastern part of the state it could be several days before all streets are plowed.
''I know that people are impatient, but I remind everyone that this is a record snowfall, the likes of which our state has never seen, or not seen since the 1880s,'' Mr. Malloy said.
Not everyone viewed the storm as a disaster.
In Canton, Peter and Dawn Siana made the best of the blizzard by snow-blowing a little ski course in their front yard for their three sons, ages 8, 7 and 3. The boys also designed and constructed their own giant igloo.
''I've never seen them so busy,'' Ms. Siana said. ''They can't get enough of it.''
In Avon, Mary Jane Bingham was thankful for a neighbor's help with the snow plowing and the ginger and carrot bisque she made for them to share.
''The sun is out, we have power and haven't lost any trees! Really can't complain too much!'' she said in an e-mail.
But, losing trees and power has been common in Connecticut in recent storms, including the pre-Halloween snowstorm in 2011 in which 830,000 people lost power.
In Old Lyme, Ms. Hamilton and her family have been surviving this particular storm by keeping a woodstove burning in their home, built in 1667, on a country dead-end road. Since they are on an electricity-powered well, they have no water.
''When we heard the storm was coming, Matt brought in a ton of wood. But we only have enough left for maybe a day or so. If we don't get power back before then, I don't know what we'll do.''
Ms. Hamilton said her family has been cooking chili, soup, and bacon and eggs on the wood stove, and huddling around it in multiple blankets. ''I also heat water on there to do dishes, which is about as primitive as you can get,'' she said.
In Mystic, Bob Dotson, who hosts ''American Story'' for NBC's ''Today'' show, lost power in his town house on Friday. ''We lost power from Hurricane Sandy for four days,'' he said. ''But that was nothing compared to this; we were warm.''
Still this storm packed enough punch that it did not necessarily need antecedents.
On Pierce Avenue in Bridgeport, Connecticut's largest city, Jose Pagan, 40, worried about a friend's ability to visit his sick mother while their street remained unplowed. Sunday, he began digging a path with a snow shovel to the nearest plowed street, Wood Avenue.
After a while, another resident, Elliott Santana, 39, joined him, and soon other neighbors with snow blowers joined in, and they eventually cleared an 80- to 90-yard path to the main road.
And for some, the storm was truly catastrophic.
Andy Mastrogiannis, 59, of New Milford, died Friday night soon after shoveling snow. Among those mourning were his sister in law, Corinne Thompson and brother-in-law and best friend, Bill Thompson of New Preston, Conn.
Mr. Thompson, who had worked with Mr. Mastrogiannis on a farm estate in Bridgewater, had often helped him plow driveways during snowstorms. Distraught, Mr. Thompson had to go back to his own work plowing roads, his wife said.
Along the way, around 1:30 a.m., Mr. Thompson's truck broke down, and he, his son and his dog had to walk along a rural road in Bridgewater, in white-out conditions, for almost two miles until help came. They were driven to Mr. Thompson's other truck, and continued to plow until 8 a.m. Saturday.
As he was pulling into his driveway, Mr. Thompson's truck got stuck in a snowdrift. Friends and neighbors pushed and pulled on Sunday to get it out.
''He got home, chugged some Jack Daniel's and passed out,'' Ms. Thompson said. ''He got up a couple of hours later and went to the funeral home to make arrangements for Andy. Then he went back out plowing. He was an emotional wreck, but that's what he had to do. People are desperate out there; no one can get out.''

A Helicopter Crash Kills 3 Television Crew Members

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

SECTION: Section B; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; MEDIA DECODER; Pg. 8

LENGTH: 382 words

A helicopter crash in Southern California on Sunday killed three men who were working on the production of a coming reality show for the Discovery Channel.
Production of the untitled series was shut down after the crash. The incident could draw new scrutiny of the production practices of reality TV shows. 
"A production company was shooting a show for Discovery Channel when this tragic accident occurred," a spokeswoman for the channel said. "We are all cooperating fully with authorities. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families."
The crash occurred around 3:30 a.m. Pacific time at Polsa Rosa Movie Ranch, about 30 miles north of Los Angeles. The ranch is frequently used by film and television crews.
"The helicopter, a Bell 206B Jet Ranger, crashed under unknown circumstances," said Allen Kenitzer, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration. The agency is helping the National Transportation Safety Board in an investigation of the crash.
A permit for filming at the ranch, provided by FilmL.A., described the Discovery Channel series as an "untitled military project." The permit allowed filming from 5 p.m. Saturday to 7 a.m. Sunday. Attached to the permit was a filming plan submitted by the helicopter pilot that proposed filming from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. Saturday.
The permit was provided to Bongo Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the production company behind the show, Eyeworks USA.
"We can confirm that a helicopter crash occurred this morning while shooting a new series for a cable network, which resulted tragically in three fatalities," an Eyeworks spokeswoman said. "We are cooperating fully with the authorities. We extend our deepest sympathies to the families of those involved."
A spokeswoman for Eyeworks identified the three victims as David Gibbs, 59; Darren Rydstrom, 45, and Michael Donatelli, 45. Mr. Gibbs was the helicoper pilot, Mr. Rydstrom a crew member and Mr. Donatelli a cast member.
Eyeworks, formerly known as 3 Ball Productions, has produced a wide range of reality shows. Its credits include "Flying Wild Alaska," a documentary series on Discovery; "Bar Rescue," on Spike; and "Splash," a diving competition that is scheduled to have its debut on ABC next month.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

War Closes In On the Heart Of Damascus

BYLINE: By an employee of THE NEW YORK TIMES in DAMASCUS SYRIA and ANNE BARNARD; Anne Barnard reported from Beirut, Lebanon.

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 1103 words

DAMASCUS, Syria -- Unkempt government soldiers, some appearing drunk, have been deployed near a rebel-held railway station in the southern reaches of this tense capital. Office workers on 29th of May Street, in the heart of the city, tell of huddling at their desks, trapped inside for hours by gun battles that sound alarmingly close.
Soldiers have swept through city neighborhoods, making arrests ahead of a threatened rebel advance downtown, even as opposition fighters edge past the city limits, carrying mortars and shelling security buildings. Fighter jets that pounded the suburbs for months have begun to strike Jobar, an outlying neighborhood of Damascus proper, creating the disturbing spectacle of a government's bombing its own capital.
On Sunday, the government sent tanks there to battle rebels for control of a key ring road. 
In this war of murky battlefield reports, it is hard to know whether the rebels' recent forays past some of the capital's circle of defenses -- in an operation that they have, perhaps immodestly, named the ''Battle of Armageddon'' -- will lead to more lasting gains than earlier offensives did. But travels along the city's battlefronts in recent days made clear that new lines, psychological as much as geographical, had been crossed.
''I didn't see my family for more than a year,'' a government soldier from a distant province said in a rare outpouring of candor. He was checking drivers' identifications near the railway station at a checkpoint where hundreds of soldiers arrived last week with tanks and other armored vehicles.
''I am tired and haven't slept well for a week,'' he said, confiding in a traveler who happened to be from his hometown. ''I have one wish -- to see my family and have a long, long sleep. Then I don't care if I die.''
For months, this ancient city has been hunched in a defensive crouch as fighting raged in suburbs that curve around the city's south and east. On the western edge of the city, the palace of the embattled president, Bashar al-Assad, sits on a steep, well-defended ridge.
In between, Damascus, with its walled Old City, grand diagonal avenues and crowded working-class districts, has remained the eye of the storm. People keep going to work, even as electric service grows sporadic and groceries dwindle, even as the road to the airport is often cut off by fighting outside the city, and even as smoke from artillery and airstrikes in suburbs becomes a regular feature on the horizon.
But after rebels took the railway station 10 days ago in a city district called Qadam and attacked Abassiyeen Square on an approach to the city center on Wednesday, a new level of alarm and disorder has suffused the city. Rebels have pushed farther into the capital than at any point since July, when they briefly held part of a southern neighborhood.
Near the Qadam railway station last week, many of the government soldiers, their hair and beards untrimmed, wore disheveled or dirty uniforms and smelled as if they had not had showers in a long time. Some soldiers and security officers even appeared drunk, walking unsteadily with their weapons askew -- a shocking sight in Syria, where regimented security forces and smartly uniformed officers have long been presented as a symbol of national pride.
The deployment appeared aimed at stopping the rebels from advancing past Qadam, either across the city's ring road and toward the downtown or to suburbs to the east to close a gap in the opposition's front line.
But even stationed here in Damascus, the heart of the government's power, the soldier at the checkpoint -- who was steady on his feet -- said he felt vulnerable.
''It is very scary to spend a night and you expect to be shot or slaughtered at any moment,'' he said. ''We spend our nights counting the minutes until daytime.''
The government has hit back hard, striking Qadam with artillery and airstrikes. It has also made pre-emptive arrests in Midan, the neighboring district, closer to downtown, where rebels gained a temporary foothold in July and which they said was their next target.
Soldiers summarily executed four people in Qadam on Friday, according to the Local Coordinating Committees, an anti-Assad activist network, though it was unclear if the victims were would-be military defectors or captured rebels.
On a recent journey along the front line, a traveler saw soldiers speaking harshly to residents at checkpoints outside Yarmouk Camp, a long-contested area east of Qadam that is home to both Syrians and Palestinian refugees, who have lived there for decades. Rebels took over much of the camp in December, drawing government airstrikes that drove out most residents. But about 20 percent of those people appear to have returned, in part, they said, because the government had attacked another refugee camp where they had taken shelter.
A Palestinian refugee who gave only a nickname, Abu Muhammad, was carrying a sack of bread into the camp. He said that he had started out with three sacks for his wife and three sons, but that officers -- he said they were from Mr. Assad's Alawite sect -- had shouted at him and confiscated two sacks, accusing him of taking bread to the rebels.
The government is pressing Palestinians to take the camp back from the rebels, Abu Muhammad said. He said that was an absurd demand from a government that bombed its own people, but made no response to last month's airstrike by Israel. ''Why doesn't the regime send its 'hero' army to liberate the camp?'' he said.
Another center of recent fighting is just northeast of the city. Rebels who have taken over much of the suburb of Qaboun recently pushed across the ring road there into the city neighborhood of Jobar. From there, said Abu Omar al-Jobrani, a leader of fighters in the area, they moved mortars close enough to attack a munitions factory and air force security headquarters near Abassiyeen Square, a traffic circle that is near a major stadium and that provides access to downtown.
Reports of rebel strikes on Wednesday on such a central landmark, which appeared to be backed up by videos showing black smoke pouring across the plaza, raised new fears in the capital. The government closed the roads around the square, causing traffic jams deep into downtown, and sent dozens of security men to protect the Parliament building. Terrified residents of the central Old City closed their shops.
Fighting continued over the weekend, as the government and rebels fought for control of the ring road near Jobar. Shells and airstrikes kept raining on the neighborhood, sending dust and smoke into the air, higher than the minarets on its mosques.

Conspiracy Buffs Gain In Court Ruling on Crash

BYLINE: By ELISABETTA POVOLEDO

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; ROME JOURNAL; Pg. 6

LENGTH: 1168 words

ROME -- Itavia Flight 870 was entering the final leg of a routine domestic trip from Bologna, Italy, to Palermo, Sicily, one clear summer evening when it suddenly plunged into the Tyrrhenian Sea near the small island of Ustica, killing all 81 people aboard.
Mechanical failure was ruled out early on, and almost 33 years later, the causes that led to the crash on June 27, 1980, are still a topic of passionate debate in Italy, fueled by three decades of inquiry boards, parliamentary commissions, countless expert reports and one of the longest judicial inquiries in recent Italian history. But despite all that, no formal charges have ever been filed in connection with the crash.
The crash, known as the Ustica affair, has produced legions of conspiracy theories here, the way the Kennedy assassination -- or, on a lesser scale, the crash of TWA Flight 800 off Long Island in 1996 -- have in the United States. But in the Ustica affair, the case for a cover-up is far stronger. 
Last week, when Italy's highest court ruled that the country's Defense and Transportation Ministries had to compensate the families of some of the victims, the court implicitly acknowledged the most widely accepted theory behind the crash: that a missile fired by a warplane had hit the twin-engine McDonnell Douglas DC-9 on Itavia, a now-defunct domestic Italian airline. But the court did not say where that missile came from.
To conspiracy buffs, it was vindication -- to a point.
''It's like the O. J. Simpson affair, where he got off in criminal court but was found guilty in a civil procedure and had to pay damages,'' said Andrea Purgatori, an investigative reporter whose exhaustive book on the disaster and the presumed cover-up was made into a 1992 film.
Over the years, several Air Force officials have been investigated for withholding evidence -- wiping clean flight tracks and radar scans -- and four generals were tried on charges of treason and obstructing investigations. But no one has been convicted.
In this hothouse atmosphere, it is not surprising that conspiracy theories have proliferated over the years. The crash has been blamed on U.F.O.'s (several Web sites subscribe to this reconstruction) or domestic terrorism (the Bologna train station was bombed not five weeks later, killing 85 and wounding dozens more). In this scenario, the plane went down after a bomb exploded onboard, most likely in the toilet.
The missile theory gained a new impetus in 2008 when Francesco Cossiga, the prime minister at the time of the Ustica affair, said in an interview that the flight had been shot down by French military planes. Mr. Cossiga did not provide further details, nor can he. He died in 2010, at age 82.
Cover-up theories have been fueled through the years by what news reports have described as a ''suspiciously high mortality'' among military personnel and others connected to the case. (Mr. Cossiga is not included among them.)
Through traffic accidents, shooting deaths and suicides by hanging, there were 36 untimely deaths by 2011, according to a television report about Ustica. The program also cited a number of ''bizarre accidents'' that befell Ustica witnesses, like being run over by a tricycle and slipping on a banana peel in a Rome subway station.
''What terrifying truth warranted a cover-up at the cost of the lives of all these people?'' asked the show's host, Adam Kadmon, who plays a mysterious masked vigilante who investigates topics like Ustica, underskin microchip implants and, more recently, Michael Jackson's prophecy about Sept. 11, and favors the French missile theory.
At the time, proponents say, Italy was covertly allowing Libyan aircraft to fly through its airspace undisturbed. They did so by gliding in the slipstream of Italian domestic aircraft, where they could not be detected by radar. On the night of June 27, 1980, there were unsubstantiated reports that Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi was on one of those planes, the theory goes, and French forces tried to shoot it down to kill the Libyan leader, but hit the DC-9 by mistake. Don't ask why. It has to do with rebels in North Africa and jockeying for oil concessions between Italy and France.
But Colonel Qaddafi had been warned of the plan and never boarded his plane, according to this reconstruction, which also says the pilot made a successful emergency landing at sea. There, a British submarine reached it and deployed scuba divers to plant explosives to sink the plane and to silence potential witnesses to the assassination attempt.
One hypothesis, detailed by an investigative journalist, Claudio Gatti, holds that the plane was shot down by Israeli forces that mistook it for a plane carrying enriched uranium earmarked for Iraq. ''No country would attack in the Mediterranean for anything but extraordinary reasons,'' and Israel ''had that reason,'' Mr. Gatti said. ''It's the only scenario that makes sense.''
The Western warplane scenario has gathered weight through the years, as Italian prosecutors disclosed that several NATO planes were flying in the same airspace that night.
But the dynamics of the grisly accident are still hypothetical. Was there a near collision with the DC-9? Was there a dogfight between NATO aircraft and Libyan jets (a theory substantiated, for some, by the recovery three weeks later of the wreckage of a Libyan MIG fighter in the remote Calabrian countryside)? Was the missile fired from a launcher based on land or sea, specifically from the French aircraft carrier Clemenceau or the United States aircraft carrier Saratoga? (The United States military denies any involvement.)
''We've known since the judicial inquiry issued in 1999 that a missile was involved, but the perpetrators are still missing. We don't know which country shot it,'' said Daria Bonfietti, who heads the association of families of the victims that has relentlessly spurred the justice system to pursue the case. The truth lies under an elaborate cover-up, she said, one in which ''everyone has something to lose.''
Prosecutors in Rome are still pursuing the Ustica affair. Several international rogatorie -- legal requests for information -- have since been sent to Belgium, France, Germany and the United States, but responses have been slow in coming, leading the victims' families to accuse those countries of dragging their feet.
Prosecutors say there are no time limits to such requests, which ''depend solely on the collaboration that countries see fit to give,'' said Erminio Amelio, one of the prosecutors currently leading the criminal investigation, which has passed through various hands over three decades.
Even though much has changed since that night in the Mediterranean almost 33 years ago -- like, for instance, the end of the cold war -- official sensitivities are still high, and no one expects any of the governments thought to be involved to come clean anytime soon.
''This is an incredible story, where a series of colossal lies have been told,'' Mr. Purgatori, the investigative reporter, said.

Weekly Police Briefing Offers Snapshot of Department and Its Leader

BYLINE: By JOSEPH GOLDSTEIN

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 15

LENGTH: 937 words

The president has his daily brief, a document of about a dozen pages concerning pressing matters of intelligence. The mayor of New York gets biweekly briefings, as well as a semiannual management report, each one some 250 pages. But in one respect, the police commissioner of New York, Raymond W. Kelly, appears to have them beat.
Each week, aides to Mr. Kelly deliver an even lengthier briefing document brimming with statistics and offering a kaleidoscopic overview of the department. 
A report from June 2011 ran 263 pages and covered a wide range of data, including the number of escaped prisoners (27 in 2010) and the specialties of Chinese organized crime in New York (trafficking of ketamine and Ecstasy, as well as collecting debts for Atlantic City loan sharks).
More than 50 pages were devoted to ''talking points on topical issues,'' like shooting episodes, confidential informants and search warrant procedures. The report, updated each week, suggests that Mr. Kelly prefers to have facts at his fingertips, rather than relying on aides for information.
For example, the report, obtained by The New York Times, indicated that the department had created a database to better track the reliability of confidential informants offering information. It told Mr. Kelly that in the previous week, no officer had been shot, committed suicide or shot a dog, but that one suspect had been shot. It gave details on the most recent escaped prisoner, and highlighted various crime trends.
It offered a breakdown of the police database of local gang members, which accounted for 22,935 people split among some 235 gangs and crews. More than 8,800 were Bloods members in 2011, and more than 3,249 belonged to the Crips. The Latin Kings claimed 2,657 members, and MS-13 had 514 members. Assorted Dominican gangs, including the Trinitarios, had 1,181 members.
The weekly report also serves as a statistical snapshot of the department.
The department spent nearly half a billion dollars in overtime costs in 2010, according to the document. The department compiled a graffiti database of ''11,018 chronic vandals as well as 16,497 color photos of their 'tags,' '' and made 3,840 arrests for graffiti in 2010 -- continuing an upward trend in graffiti arrest numbers.
The department had 59 horses, 114 motorcycles and 941 scooters. Its mobile license plate readers built a database of 16 million license plates, along with locations where the car was spotted.
The number of investigators assigned to narcotics cases has dwindled under Mr. Kelly. Since 1999, the number of investigators assigned to the Narcotics Division has decreased to 1,156 from 2,955, excluding undercover officers.
Over nearly a decade, the department's quality-of-life policing strategy has led to over 737,000 summonses and 76,000 arrests (as well as 1,638 placements for the homeless) at specific locations slated for extra police attention. The document indicates that the locations drew police attention for any number of reasons, like large numbers of prostitutes, homeless people or peddlers, or drug dealing. A few of the locations drew the police's attention for other reasons: one intersection in the Bronx was notorious for drag racing; dice games were cited as a problem at Putnam and Grand Avenues in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn.
''There is a lot on the police commissioner's plate every week,'' the Police Department's chief spokesman, Paul J. Browne, said. ''Things are rarely static in police work. It lends itself to information being in flux, and you need to stay as current as possible -- that's reflected in the size of the book and the face-to-face briefings that the commissioner has each week.''
Mr. Browne said that Mr. Kelly often reads the report on an iPad.
''He'll read the briefing material as he's going to and from community meetings and hospital visits,'' Mr. Browne said.
The document, titled ''Police Commissioner's Weekly Agency Overview,'' suggests that certain issues may be of particular interest to Mr. Kelly. Several pages are devoted to statistics about domestic violence and the department's response, like monthly visits to homes with a ''high propensity'' for domestic violence. One bullet point in 2011 noted a startling statistic: there were 1.8 million current and expired orders of protection on file in a police database (20,000 new ones are entered each month).
Numerous tables are devoted to the department's demographics. Some 53 percent of police officers were white, the document showed, although higher-ranking commanders are much more likely to be white. For instance, 85.2 percent of the department's inspectors were white men, as were 86.3 percent of the department's deputy chiefs.
The document is prepared by the police's Office of Management and Planning, an in-house think tank of sorts, which shares the 14th floor of Police Headquarters with Mr. Kelly.
The 2011 report steered clear of controversial topics, like the debate over the rise in police stops during Mr. Kelly's tenure.
The report did make mention of an issue with some direct connection to Mr. Kelly; the Harvard Club, where Mr. Kelly occasionally entertains guests, had received a ''security/vulnerability assessment'' from the department's counterterrorism bureau. Such assessments typically involve an examination of ''a building's threat posture and the potential consequences of an attack, and set out recommendations for building owners for improving security,'' according to the document.
Mr. Browne said the counterterrorism bureau ''conducted a similar assessment for The New York Times Building, as it does for many other buildings in the public eye.''

The Ignorance Caucus

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; OP-ED COLUMNIST; Pg. 19

LENGTH: 798 words

Last week Eric Cantor, the House majority leader, gave what his office told us would be a major policy speech. And we should be grateful for the heads-up about the speech's majorness. Otherwise, a read of the speech might have suggested that he was offering nothing more than a meager, warmed-over selection of stale ideas.
To be sure, Mr. Cantor tried to sound interested in serious policy discussion. But he didn't succeed -- and that was no accident. For these days his party dislikes the whole idea of applying critical thinking and evidence to policy questions. And no, that's not a caricature: Last year the Texas G.O.P. explicitly condemned efforts to teach ''critical thinking skills,'' because, it said, such efforts ''have the purpose of challenging the student's fixed beliefs and undermining parental authority.'' 
And such is the influence of what we might call the ignorance caucus that even when giving a speech intended to demonstrate his openness to new ideas, Mr. Cantor felt obliged to give that caucus a shout-out, calling for a complete end to federal funding of social science research. Because it's surely a waste of money seeking to understand the society we're trying to change.
Want other examples of the ignorance caucus at work? Start with health care, an area in which Mr. Cantor tried not to sound anti-intellectual; he lavished praise on medical research just before attacking federal support for social science. (By the way, how much money are we talking about? Well, the entire National Science Foundation budget for social and economic sciences amounts to a whopping 0.01 percent of the budget deficit.)
But Mr. Cantor's support for medical research is curiously limited. He's all for developing new treatments, but he and his colleagues have adamantly opposed ''comparative effectiveness research,'' which seeks to determine how well such treatments work.
What they fear, of course, is that the people running Medicare and other government programs might use the results of such research to determine what they're willing to pay for. Instead, they want to turn Medicare into a voucher system and let individuals make decisions about treatment. But even if you think that's a good idea (it isn't), how are individuals supposed to make good medical choices if we ensure that they have no idea what health benefits, if any, to expect from their choices?
Still, the desire to perpetuate ignorance on matters medical is nothing compared with the desire to kill climate research, where Mr. Cantor's colleagues -- particularly, as it happens, in his home state of Virginia -- have engaged in furious witch hunts against scientists who find evidence they don't like. True, the state has finally agreed to study the growing risk of coastal flooding; Norfolk is among the American cities most vulnerable to climate change. But Republicans in the State Legislature have specifically prohibited the use of the words ''sea-level rise.''
And there are many other examples, like the way House Republicans tried to suppress a Congressional Research Service report casting doubt on claims about the magical growth effects of tax cuts for the wealthy.
Do actions like this have important effects? Well, consider the agonized discussions of gun policy that followed the Newtown massacre. It would be helpful to these discussions if we had a good grasp of the facts about firearms and violence. But we don't, because back in the 1990s conservative politicians, acting on behalf of the National Rifle Association, bullied federal agencies into ceasing just about all research into the issue. Willful ignorance matters.
O.K., at this point the conventions of punditry call for saying something to demonstrate my evenhandedness, something along the lines of ''Democrats do it too.'' But while Democrats, being human, often read evidence selectively and choose to believe things that make them comfortable, there really isn't anything equivalent to Republicans' active hostility to collecting evidence in the first place.
The truth is that America's partisan divide runs much deeper than even pessimists are usually willing to admit; the parties aren't just divided on values and policy views, they're divided over epistemology. One side believes, at least in principle, in letting its policy views be shaped by facts; the other believes in suppressing the facts if they contradict its fixed beliefs.
In her parting shot on leaving the State Department, Hillary Clinton said of her Republican critics, ''They just will not live in an evidence-based world.'' She was referring specifically to the Benghazi controversy, but her point applies much more generally. And for all the talk of reforming and reinventing the G.O.P., the ignorance caucus retains a firm grip on the party's heart and mind.

With Inquiry, An Attempt To Reassure Los Angeles

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA and IAN LOVETT

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 9

LENGTH: 1089 words

LOS ANGELES -- Police Chief Charlie Beck stood in front of a bank of television cameras on Sunday afternoon facing what seemed like two impossible tasks: luring in a fugitive former police officer accused of three murders and simultaneously assuring the public that his department was not backsliding on accusations of racism and corruption.
For the last four days, dozens of law enforcement agencies across Southern California have been searching for Christopher J. Dorner, the former officer who posted a manifesto online promising revenge against Los Angeles police officers and claiming that racism had led to his firing. Chief Beck said on Sunday that the search for Mr. Dorner, who is wanted in connection with the killing of a former police captain's daughter and her fiancי and the shooting death of a police officer in Riverside, Calif., was ''by far the largest manhunt in the history of the L.A. region.''
Chief Beck spoke with visible emotion of the toll the threats were taking on officers. ''I think all of us in law enforcement accept a level of risk when we become police officers,'' he said at a news conference where he announced a $1 million reward for information that leads to the arrest of Mr. Dorner. ''But none of us accept that level of risk for our families, believe me.'' 
At the same time, Chief Beck said he was eager to protect the reputation of a department that he had worked painstakingly to repair over the last several years. On Saturday, he said he would review the investigation of the 2007 episode that led to Mr. Dorner's dismissal. He was fired in 2008 for giving false statements after he accused his training officer of kicking a suspect.
''I hear that people think that maybe there is something to what he says, and I want to put that to rest,'' Chief Beck said. ''The only way I know how to put that to rest is to review what has already been reviewed at multiple levels. But it has never been reviewed by me.''
Though many say the Los Angeles Police Department has radically transformed over the last two decades, Mr. Dorner's letter has renewed talk about the department's history of problems in dealing with African-Americans and in investigating charges of racism in its ranks.
''When I read that manifesto, my heart sank,'' said Connie Rice, a civil rights lawyer who represented police officers who faced retaliation after reporting racial problems and who has worked closely with the department to institute changes. ''Anything that threatens to undo what we've worked so hard for can mean a real crisis. They need to show that this isn't the old L.A.P.D. circling the wagons and manning the ramparts, but instead going to look to see if any mistakes were made.''
It was still unclear exactly how the department would investigate Mr. Dorner's claims, but Ms. Rice and others said someone outside the police force should lead the inquiry.
''I still don't trust internal affairs,'' Ms. Rice said.
Late last week, Chief Beck said he believed that Mr. Dorner's dismissal had been ''thoroughly adjudicated'' and ''reviewed at multiple levels.'' But that did little to quiet speculation in some quarters that the former officer had legitimate claims of racism.
The mistrust of the police deepened for some after two officers mistakenly shot two Latina women, a 71-year-old and her 47-year-old daughter, who were delivering newspapers in a truck that officers thought matched the description of Mr. Dorner's vehicle.
''That's the undercurrent you have -- that police were in such a rush to kill him they shot two Latina women who resemble nothing like a 6-foot-2-inch black man,'' said Najee Ali, the executive director of Project Islamic Hope, who has been a frequent critic of the department. ''That was a game changer for those who had just been casually watching and waiting for this to unfold. It gave the notion that they are out to get people credibility.''
But in some way, Mr. Ali said, the chief's decision lends more credence to Mr. Dorner's claims, which are just one part of his eight-page screed that also criticizes Wayne LaPierre of the National Rifle Association and praises the actor Charlie Sheen. (Mr. Sheen posted a video on the Internet over the weekend asking Mr. Dorner to call him so they could ''figure out together how to end this thing.'')
''They're turning him into some kind of a folk hero,'' Mr. Ali said. ''It gives people a context to view him as a man wrongly vilified by the system. If Beck is caving to political pressure, I'm not sure what it gets anyone -- it's not as though he is going to get his job back.''
Earl Ofari Hutchinson, who hosts a radio talk show here, said he heard from dozens of listeners who saw a pattern in what Mr. Dorner described.
''Given the history of the L.A.P.D. and the fact that there are so many people who have problems, there was going to be a huge backlash,'' Mr. Hutchinson said. ''There was going to be so much public clamor that Beck knew he had to get in front of it. Even the fact that they are willing to walk it back and look into it is going to be persuasive.''
At a forum on Saturday for candidates running for mayor -- sponsored by several African-American groups -- one woman asked each candidate if they would support an investigation of Mr. Dorner's case. Each said they would.
''This has gone far beyond just being about Dorner,'' said Jan Perry, one of the candidates. ''There is a real level of anxiety that people are talking about, and the chief is intelligent to engage in this process.''
John Mack, the vice president of the police commission who frequently criticized the police in the past, said it was important that the department not become complacent and assume that the right actions are taken at every level.
''We have to keep our eye on the ball and challenge the system,'' he said. But he dismissed any concern that a renewed investigation would encourage others who have been dismissed to take similar actions. ''We need to be clear this in no way even implies that there was any justification to Mr. Dornan's actions.''
Whether an investigation will lead to any new discoveries about Mr. Dorner is impossible to know. But Mayor Antonio R. Villaraigosa seemingly acknowledged that the authorities wanted him to know that they were looking into his claims.
''This is a man that's been preparing what he's doing for a long time now, it seems as long as 2009,'' the mayor said. ''You can bet, if he's still alive, that he's watching this newscast, that he's reviewing every single article that's written on this.''

Mali Rebels Attack City They Fled Last Month

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER and PETER TINTI; Adam Nossiter reported from Dakar, and Peter Tinti from Gao, Mali.

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 8

LENGTH: 678 words

DAKAR, Senegal -- Gunfire rang out in the streets of the strategic city of Gao in northern Mali on Sunday, two weeks after French troops appeared to have chased radical Islamists out of the city, which is at the edge of the desert and is the largest population center in the north.
The gun battle between Islamist militants and a force of Malian and French troops, which continued for much of Sunday afternoon, suggested that the quick French campaign against the local Al Qaeda affiliate and its allies was not over, but had entered a new phase of guerrilla warfare. 
Sunday's attack by the Islamist fighters was the most serious escalation in the fighting since the French ended over six months of brutal Islamist occupation in Gao at the end of January. That victory came after a quick French bombing campaign and with barely a shot fired.
Continuous bursts of gunfire were heard around the police station, in the city's center and in southern districts as French helicopters hovered overhead. Malian soldiers fought back against Islamists armed with AK-47 rifles as the streets cleared of residents. French troops were also patrolling the city, which has a population of about 86,000, including its surrounding areas.
By late Sunday afternoon, the Islamist fighters had been encircled by French troops, according to a Gao municipal councilor, Abdheramane Oumarou. Later, Mr. Oumarou said that troops had launched a ''final assault'' on the town's police station, where Islamist fighters had taken refuge, and that it appeared to have been successful.
The Islamists' attack appeared to have begun with an attempted suicide bombing late Saturday night, when a militant on foot blew himself up at a Malian Army checkpoint outside of town, in the second such episode in two days. The bomber's attack, which wounded a Malian soldier, was merely a ruse to allow an Islamist commando unit to enter the city, Mr. Oumarou said.
''The Malian soldiers panicked; that's how the Mujao got into town,'' Mr. Oumaro said, referring to the Islamist group, the Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa, which is affiliated with Al Qaeda and controlled Gao from May to January. Mr. Oumarou said that the fighters who penetrated Gao were aided by local sympathizers, and that caches of armaments had been discovered by the local authorities.
A Malian Army spokesman said that the bomber was part of a commando team of about 20 Islamist fighters who assaulted a bridge in marshland linking Gao to neighboring villages.
The spokesman, Capt. Daouda Diarra, said the bomber appeared to be of Arab ancestry. He tried to penetrate the army checkpoint, the captain said, setting off his explosives.
''It's pretty hot in the town right now,'' said the mayor, Sadou H. Diallo, who was reached by phone on Sunday afternoon. ''I can't talk now.''
Though the French appeared to be leading the fight on Sunday, primary responsibility for patrols had been handed back to the Malian Army, which is still shaky after the defeats of last month that led the French to intervene, and still plagued by the internecine squabbles that led to a gun battle at a barracks in the capital, Bamako, on Friday.
Embarrassed by the recent events, Mali's interim president, Dioncounda Traorי, apologized to the country's foreign partners in a statement to the state news media. Mali is dependent on large-scale military assistance and other aid from overseas.
The explosion on Saturday night rocked the neighborhood. ''We were very scared,'' said a resident, Halimatou Tourי. ''There are lots of mujahedeen who come from this area,'' she said. The bomber's remains were removed in a wheelbarrow, and French armored vehicles took up positions at the checkpoint.
While Sunday's clashes showed that the northern cities are still vulnerable to attacks from Islamists, the bulk of their force is thought to have taken refuge in the Adrar des Ifoghas, a remote mountain range near Algeria and hundreds of miles to the north of Gao. Troops from France and Chad, supported by French aircraft, are pursuing the Islamists there as well.

For a Composer's Birthday, A Tribute at Full Blast

BYLINE: By STEVE SMITH

SECTION: Section C; Column 0; The Arts/Cultural Desk; MUSIC REVIEW; Pg. 8

LENGTH: 538 words

''There's a little piece of paper attached to your program, but I have still been asked to say there will be a gunshot fired -- a blank, of course,'' the composer John Corigliano announced from the Carnegie Hall stage on Saturday night. 
''Now the reason this gun is fired is not just for special effect,'' he said, matter-of-factly. ''It's because it's supposed to frighten you.''
The occasion at hand was a concert by the Juilliard Orchestra honoring Mr. Corigliano's 75th birthday, which actually arrives on Saturday. Despite rough weather a hardy audience liberally sprinkled with composers assembled to celebrate, and to hear Mr. Corigliano's Symphony No. 3, ''Circus Maximus.''
Mr. Corigliano won the prestigious Grawemeyer Award for music composition for his Symphony No. 1. Two different recordings of that piece earned Grammy Awards. His Symphony No. 2, also performed here, won the 2001 Pulitzer Prize.
That Mr. Corigliano's Third Symphony has received comparatively less attention is almost certainly because he wrote it for wind ensemble rather than for symphony orchestra. The piece, introduced in 2005 by the University of Texas Wind Ensemble, is a major statement: the product of an enfant terrible grown into an elder statesman, his prodigious, provocative faculties razor sharp.
The symphony vividly expresses Mr. Corigliano's discouragement with the modern world's fragmented focus and lust for blood sport. ''Introitus,'' a recurring fanfare of nattering trumpets and machine-gun drum bursts emanating from players positioned in audience tiers throughout the hall, engulfs a listener, overloading senses immediately.
''Screen/Siren,'' in which hidden saxophonists lure other players into taking up their lissome song, segues into ''Channel Surfing,'' where fleeting snatches of music in a variety of familiar styles are cut off sharply with percussive snaps, meant to suggest a television's remote control. Two ''Night Music'' segments follow: the first a distant prairie with glittering stars and coyote yelps; the second an urban bustle punctuated with jazzy licks, heard briefly as if through nightclub doorways.
Bits of everything heard previously recur in the sixth movement, also titled ''Circus Maximus,'' in which a motley marching band stamped down one aisle and up the other. The concluding mass tutti might have been the loudest sound anyone has ever produced in Carnegie Hall. ''Prayer,'' awash in Mr. Corigliano's distinctive strain of melancholy lushness, offered passing easefulness, before tumult mounted anew in ''Coda: Veritas'' -- the forewarned shotgun blast a final jolt in a deeply unsettling work.
Marin Alsop, the conductor, was exemplary in shaping the piece's thrust and keeping its disparate parts in balance. The musicians, presumably including many seldom afforded so prominent a spotlight, were uniformly superb.
During the concert's first half Juilliard's string players rose to the occasion for a confident, deeply sensitive account of Mr. Corigliano's Symphony No. 2: a string-orchestra work eerie, driven and elegiac by turns, and dedicated here to the memory of the conductor James DePreist, Juilliard's director emeritus of conducting and orchestral studies, who died on Friday at 76.

Measure to Protect Women Stuck on Tribal Land Issue

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 11

LENGTH: 1059 words

WASHINGTON -- At 26, Diane Millich fell in love with and married a white man, moving with him in 1998 to a home on her native Southern Ute reservation in southern Colorado where, in short order, her life was consumed by domestic violence.
Her story of beatings and threats, reconciliations and divorce -- painfully common among Native American women -- had a twist. Because her husband was white, the Southern Ute Tribal Police could not touch him, and because she was a Native American on tribal land, La Plata County sheriff's deputies were powerless as well. She said she tried going to federal law enforcement, which did have jurisdiction, but that went nowhere. 
After one of his beatings, she said, he even called the county sheriff himself to prove to her that he could not be stopped. Only after he stormed her office at the federal Bureau of Land Management and opened fire, wounding a co-worker, was he arrested. And even then, law enforcement had to use a tape measure to sort out jurisdiction, gauging the distance between the barrel of the gun and the point of bullet impact to persuade the local police to intervene.
Obscure as it might be, the issue of tribal court powers and Ms. Millich's jurisdictional black hole has become the last remaining controversy holding up Congress's broad reauthorization of the landmark Violence Against Women Act. The Senate on Monday is expected to approve the 218-page bill with broad, bipartisan support.
But in the House, Republican negotiators are still struggling over a 10-page section that would, for the first time, allow Native American police and courts to pursue non-Indians who attack women on tribal land. Supporters and opponents of the language acknowledge the plight of women like Ms. Millich. Native American women are two and a half times more likely to be raped. One in three will be assaulted, and three out of five will encounter domestic violence, said Senator Tom Udall, Democrat of New Mexico.
''It was just crazy, now when I think back on how insane it was,'' Ms. Millich said in an interview.
If a Native American is raped or assaulted by a non-Indian, she must plead for justice to already overburdened United States attorneys who are often hundreds of miles away.
''Native women should not be abandoned to a jurisdictional loophole,'' Mr. Udall said.
But conservative opponents say the Senate's language goes too far, empowering courts that are not equipped for the job and depriving defendants of constitutional rights without nearly enough recourse to federal courts and no guaranteed protections like those afforded by the Bill of Rights.
''This is a bill which could do so much good in the battle for victims' rights, but unfortunately it is being held hostage by a single provision that would take away fundamental constitutional rights for certain American citizens,'' Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, said on the Senate floor on Thursday. ''And for what? For what? In order to satisfy the unconstitutional demands of special interests.''
The fight is pitting a dry legal position against an emotional and politically potent one. Native American groups and women's rights advocates say they are not special interests. They are voters, however.
''Let's just talk politics here,'' said Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma, who has been leading negotiations to end the impasse. ''This will have passed the Senate. The president's for it. And we're holding up a domestic violence bill that should be routine because you don't want to help Native women who are the most vulnerable over a philosophical point?''
Mr. Cole and another senior Republican, Representative Darrell Issa of California, have met repeatedly with Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader, to try to get Republicans past the tribal courts issue. They have proposed extending Native American court powers but also offering non-Indian defendants a chance to appeal to federal law enforcement after arrest and after a conviction. Representatives from the National Congress of American Indians met with Cantor staff members last week as well -- and they have backed the Issa-Cole compromise.
But with the Senate's action, native groups say they will feel less pressure to water down the provision, not more. Jacqueline Pata, executive director of the National Congress of American Indians, said the tribes have tried to assuage Congressional misgivings, expanding financing and capacity, bolstering indigent legal representation, and changing rules to ensure that non-Indian defendants would face a jury of their peers, Indian and non-Indian alike.
At this point, said Ms. Pata, an Alaska Native, the opposition smacks of bias.
''When you see these amendments that give more rights to perpetrators than Native women, you start to wonder where the balance is,'' she said. ''We would give any other community in this country the resources and tools they need for justice, but we won't give them to the Indians.''
Mr. Cole, whose state has one of the largest Indian populations in the country, agreed, to a point. He said some of his colleagues seem to ''fear Indians are going to take out 500 years of mistreatment on us through this.''
''It's that kind of fear, veiled in constitutional theories,'' he said.
Republican leaders are eager to tamp down such accusations. Mr. Cantor took to the House floor last week to assure Democratic leaders that he cares ''very deeply about women in the abuse situation, that we need to get them the relief that this bill offers,'' and that he is even enlisting Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in the talks.
But, he warned, ''There's been the introduction of some issues that are not directly related to the situation of domestic abuse on tribal lands.''
Advocates of the Senate's tribal language -- including some Republicans -- say they are not giving up. Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, went to the Senate floor on Thursday to denounce the violence endemic in her state's native communities, and to say she will urge the House to move forward.
''You don't give up when the cause is right,'' she said.
For Ms. Millich, the issue is very much alive. Her ex-husband is in prison, but she said she still feels the threat.
''It would be really good,'' she said, ''that regardless of where violence takes place, they're able to be prosecuted.''

Rising Voice of Gun Ownership Is Female

BYLINE: By ERICA GOODE

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 9

LENGTH: 1322 words

PAINESVILLE, Ohio -- Mary Ann Froebe stood feet apart with knees slightly bent and aimed the .22-caliber Ruger semiautomatic.
''You've got some adrenaline running through you right now,'' said Esther Beris, the coordinator of the northeastern Ohio chapter of A Girl and a Gun Women's Shooting League. ''It's O.K., just relax.''
Ms. Froebe, 42, a small-business owner who described herself as a ''virgin gun shooter,'' concentrated and pulled the trigger. ''It was awesome,'' she said, her face flushed, after emptying the 10-round clip. ''The sense of control, of being in charge of me.''
In the debate over firearms regulations, the voices of gun owners have largely been those of men. But at firing ranges across the country, a growing number of women are learning to use firearms and honing their skills. 
Women's participation in shooting sports has surged over the last decade, increasing by 51.5 percent for target shooting from 2001 to 2011, to just over 5 million women, and by 41.8 percent for hunting, according to the National Sporting Goods Association.
Gun sales to women have risen in concert. In a survey last year by the National Shooting Sports Foundation, 73 percent of gun dealers said the number of female customers had gone up in 2011, as had a majority of retailers surveyed in the two previous years.
Manufacturers have increasingly geared advertising toward women, marketing special firearms models with smaller frames, custom colors (pink is a favorite), and accessories like the ''concealed carry'' ''salmon kiss'' leather handbag offered by Cobra Firearms or the leopard shooting gloves and Bullet Rosette jewelry sold by Sweet Shot (''Look cute while you shoot!'' is the company's motto).
Women's shooting clubs have also proliferated -- not just in small towns like Painesville, but also in Atlanta, Houston, even Manhattan, where a women's gun club meets regularly at a firing range in Chelsea, a neighborhood better known for art galleries.
On a recent Friday, Ms. Froebe and eight other women attended the Painesville shooting league's inaugural Breakfast and Bullets gathering at Perkins Family Restaurant for brunch and then moved on to Atwell's Shooting Range. There, Ms. Beris taught them how to hold and load a handgun safely and then coached them on the range.
Though they may share a fierce belief in the Second Amendment with their male counterparts, female gun owners often learn to shoot for different reasons, their interest in and proficiency with firearms not just a hobby or a means for self-defense, but a statement of independence and personal power.
Tina Wilson-Cohen, a former Secret Service agent who founded She Can Shoot, a women's league with 10 chapters and 3,000 members across the country, said 90 percent of women who joined did so because ''they've been a victim at one point of their life, of stalking or date rape or domestic violence, or they have just felt so vulnerable, and they want to feel competent and like they can protect themselves.''
Firearms also often carry a different meaning for women than for men, who grow up with Hollywood images of guns that tell them ''this is what a real man looks like and that's how a real man acts, and it's kind of delusional, really,'' Ms. Wilson-Cohen said.
''We don't see women acting like this,'' she said. ''It doesn't have that bad-ass mentality attached to it.''
Yet women who shoot recreationally often find themselves confronting the misconceptions of the non-gun-owning public, said Mary Stange, a professor of women's studies and religion at Skidmore College and a co-author of ''Gun Women: Firearms and Feminism in Contemporary America.''
She said that when Nancy Lanza was identified as the owner of the guns her son Adam used to kill 20 children and 6 adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in December, some seemed to blame her. Ms. Lanza, who owned at least five firearms, including a Bushmaster AR-15-style rifle used in the shooting, was labeled in a headline as a ''gun-crazed mother'' and was described in some accounts as ''stockpiling an arsenal.''
''What strikes me is the way that, rather than really trying to understand what may have been going on, there is this tendency to want to latch on to conventional arguments and stereotypical images,'' Professor Stange said. ''There's this idea that women are more affiliative, more peace loving, more pacifistic, which should then make women as a group gun averse.''
It is difficult to pinpoint how many gun owners in the United States are women -- the federal government does not break down background checks by demographic, and most manufacturers do not release information on sales. But Peggy Tartaro, the editor of Women and Guns magazine, a nonprofit publication of the Second Amendment Foundation, said she had found estimates varying from 12 million to 17 million.
They cross the political spectrum. Professor Stange, who hunts regularly and owns several rifles and shotguns, describes herself as a liberal Democrat.
Of those who attended the breakfast in Painesville, Ms. Froebe votes Republican. Terri Herbert, 57, a retired special education teacher who said the nephew of a close friend had been killed in a school shooting, is a registered Democrat. She favors background checks on private sales but opposes a ban on military-style semiautomatic rifles or high-capacity magazines. ''I'm not sure gun control is the answer,'' she said.
Tamara Wysocki, 52, a caterer, said she wanted a handgun for protection at her business, but would not keep a gun at home. ''If you have a gun and they have a gun, somebody's bound to get shot,'' she said.
Ms. Tartaro, the magazine editor, said that women's interest in guns began increasing in the 1980s, when women began moving into previously male-dominated professions like law enforcement and the military and began taking charge of their own finances and living arrangements. ''It makes sense that as you think about your financial security and your kids' security, the whole idea of personal protection and home defense comes in,'' she said.
Smith & Wesson, which in 1989 introduced a LadySmith line of revolvers, was the first manufacturer to recognize the potential of the women's market, Ms. Tartaro said, but other gun makers soon followed. And the attitudes of men gradually changed, she said.
''Maybe 25 years ago, if you put on your power suit with your floppy bow and marched yourself into a gun club and said, 'Where do I sign up, boys?' you might have gotten a couple of funny looks,'' Ms. Tartaro said. ''But now they might say: 'Hey, sit down. What are you interested in? I'll show you mine if you show me yours.' ''
Advocates of tighter firearms regulations have argued in the past that advertising by gun manufacturers manipulates women into buying guns for protection. An advertisement by Colt in the 1990s showed a mother tucking a child into bed -- ''Self-protection is more than your right ... it's your responsibility,'' the ad said -- and academics argued in 1991 in The Whittier Law Review that such ads were intended to trick women.
But Ms. Tartaro bridles at the idea that women are not smart enough to decide for themselves whether to buy a gun. After the article appeared, her publication went on the counterattack, running a cover line that said, ''Are You Too Stupid to Read This Magazine?''
Yet even some of the most ardent female gun enthusiasts said the industry had made a misstep in concluding that all women shooters like pink.
Professor Stange called gun makers' obsession with the color ''infantilizing.'' Ms. Wilson-Cohen said that ''a large majority of females sort of feel like it's a slap in the face'' to assume that a pink gun will draw them in.
For her part, Ms. Tartaro said, ''I don't personally care for it.''
But she added that she knew a woman who had a different take, saying, ''It's not my favorite color, but I bought it because now my husband never touches it.''

2 Men Are Held In Shooting Death Of Girl in Chicago

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

LENGTH: 128 words

CHICAGO (AP) -- Two men were taken into custody on Sunday as ''persons of interest'' in the fatal shooting of a 15-year-old girl here, a police spokeswoman said. 
The spokeswoman, Melissa Stratton, said the two men, ages 18 and 20, were taken into custody early Sunday morning and were being questioned. She said no charges have been filed.
The development comes a day after the funeral of Hadiya Pendleton, which the first lady, Michelle Obama, and several other dignitaries attended.
Hadiya was shot and killed Jan. 29 in a park about a mile from President Obama's home on the city's South Side. The police have said that she was an innocent victim in a gang-related shooting.
Days before her death, Hadiya, a band majorette, performed during Mr. Obama's inauguration events.

Motivated by a long child custody dispute, a man opened fire on Monday in the lobby of the New Castle County Courthouse just as the building was opening, leaving two women dead before police officers fatally shot him, the authorities said. Sgt. Paul Shavack of the Delaware State Police said two police officers suffered wounds that were not life-threatening. The gunman opened fire before he passed metal detectors in the lobby, the sergeant said. Joseph R. Biden III, the state attorney general, said at a news conference that the shooting was not a random act. ''It's developed out of a long -- over the course of many years -- custody dispute in the courts of this state,'' he said.

Three Nigerian journalists have been arrested and accused of inciting violence by saying on a radio show that polio immunizations were an anti-Islamic Western conspiracy, just days before health workers administering the vaccines were killed, the police said Monday. Gunmen shot the nine health workers in Kano on Friday. The Kano police chief, Ibrahim Idris, said Monday that three journalists from the radio station Wazobia FM had been detained after they said on their show last Wednesday that immunization against polio was anti-Islamic and a Western conspiracy to cause infertility in women.

Chicago Mayor Seeks More Prison Time for Gun Crimes

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY; Michael D. Shear contributed reporting from Washington.

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 17

LENGTH: 714 words

CHICAGO -- On a day when the authorities here filed murder charges in a case that had come to represent the painful price of gun violence, Mayor Rahm Emanuel on Monday called on state lawmakers to increase minimum sentences for gun crimes in Illinois and require violators to serve the bulk of those prison sentences.
The push to increase minimum sentences for serious gun violations to three years in prison comes as one piece in a larger assortment of efforts -- including more mentoring, after-school activities, policing and early childhood education -- that Mr. Emanuel and other leaders here say they are advocating to stem gang-connected violence that contributed to more than 500 deaths in Chicago last year. 
The legislative proposal came not long before the Chicago police announced arrests in the killing of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old high school majorette who was fatally shot here a week after taking part in inauguration festivities in Washington. The two men arrested -- Michael Ward, 18, and Kenneth Williams, 20 -- had ties to a gang, the police said, and one of them had been convicted of a gun charge last year but was granted probation.
The death of Ms. Pendleton, who the police say had no ties to gangs and had once appeared in a video urging young people to stay out of gangs, has drawn new national focus to everyday urban gun violence, beyond the mass shootings that grab national headlines like those at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., and a movie theater in Aurora, Colo. The two men charged in the case mistakenly thought that Ms. Pendleton and a group of her friends who had gathered in a park on the city's South Side were members of a rival gang, the police said, and were seeking retaliation for an earlier shooting.
Ms. Pendleton's parents were expected to attend the State of the Union address on Tuesday as guests of Michelle Obama, who traveled to Chicago over the weekend to attend the girl's funeral. President Obama is expected to appear in Chicago on Friday, officials said, both to elaborate on the economic themes he plans to raise in the address and to talk about gun violence in Chicago and around the nation.
Mr. Emanuel, who served as Mr. Obama's chief of staff, said he welcomed the visit. ''We have to have the enforcement,'' he said. ''We have to have better gun laws. We have to have more investment in our children. But part of this is having an honest conversation, given that the lion's share of both the victims and the perpetrators are young African-American men. Who better to have that discussion than the president of the United States, who has repeatedly talked about fathering and the role of fathering?''
Compared with some other parts of the country, Illinois and Chicago laws regulating weapons are seen as relatively strict. Still, in a city that banned handguns until 2010 when a court overturned the ordinance, guns have been prevalent. More guns have been confiscated in recent months by the police here than in the nation's two larger cities, New York and Los Angeles. In just the first six weeks of the year, 809 weapons were seized here, the police superintendent, Garry F. McCarthy, said Monday, standing near a table covered in guns.
While some view Chicago's experience as evidence that gun restrictions fail to improve safety, others say it reflects a need for consistent federal restrictions rather than a patchwork of local and state laws, as well as for sentencing harsh enough to deter gang members.
Anita Alvarez, the Cook County state's attorney, said that gun offenders here sometimes get one-year sentences and may serve only about half of their sentences or even less.
Mr. Ward, who was charged with murder and attempted murder in the shooting that left Ms. Pendleton dead in a park not far from Mr. Obama's Chicago home on Jan. 29, in 2012 received a sentence of two years' probation, Superintendent McCarthy said, after being charged with unlawful use of a weapon. A mandatory prison sentence, the superintendent said, could have changed everything.
''We cannot continue to rely on laws that are not working and expect to see a different result,'' Ms. Alvarez said, urging the legislative changes that would require that those convicted in gun crimes to serve at least 85 percent of their sentences.

Militant Threats Test Pentagon's Role in Africa

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 1418 words

NIAMEY, Niger -- Created five years ago to focus on training the armed forces of dozens of African nations and strengthening social, political and economic programs, the Pentagon's Africa Command now finds itself on a more urgent mission: confronting a new generation of Islamist militants who are testing the United States' resolve to fight terrorism without being drawn into a major conflict.
Some military and Congressional critics question whether the command is up to dealing with its dual mission, and some influential lawmakers warn that Africom, with its headquarters in Germany, is understaffed and poorly financed for challenges that include countering Al Qaeda's fighters in Mali, Islamic extremists in Libya, drug traffickers in West Africa and armed rebels in the Democratic Republic of Congo. 
The leader of the command, Gen. Carter F. Ham, must straddle the new and the old missions, as he demonstrated one day last month when he flew to the northern reaches of this largely desert nation to watch United States troops train Niger's fledgling border corps in basic skills to help combat Al Qaeda's branch in North and West Africa. Then, within hours, he was back here in the capital for an urgent secure phone call from Washington to weigh what kind of advanced military support or surveillance the Pentagon could provide a French-led operation to blunt an Islamist offensive in neighboring Mali.
''The command is searching to find the right balance between the press of current military operations and the vision of longer-term engagement, helping Africans develop greater capacity for themselves,'' said Christopher W. Dell, a former United States ambassador to Angola and Zimbabwe, who is General Ham's deputy for civil-military activities.
Africom has an annual budget of about $300 million and 2,000 employees worldwide -- an operation that Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat who is chairman of the Armed Services Committee, calls ''an 'economy of force' effort.'' By comparison, the military's Central Command, which oversees Afghanistan and the Middle East, has a yearly budget of about $800 million and 5,000 employees.
With no assigned forces in the region except for those at a base in Djibouti, in the Horn of Africa, the command was caught napping last Sept. 11, critics contend, when it had no military forces poised to respond to the attack on the diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens. An independent review of the attack concluded that events had unfolded too quickly for any American forces to make a difference.
Still, controversy has dogged the command since its creation in 2008. Initial statements about its mission and scope of activity alarmed some African leaders and State Department officials, who feared that the Pentagon was trying to militarize diplomacy and development on the continent. These concerns led the command to set up its headquarters in Stuttgart.
The command's first boss, Gen. William E. Ward, left two years ago under a cloud. Pentagon investigators later found that General Ward had lavishly overspent on official trips. He was ordered to repay the government $82,000 and was forced to retire as a lieutenant general, a one-rank demotion.
Enter General Ham, who turns 61 this week and is the rare Army officer to have risen from private to four-star commander in a 40-year career. He has led troops in northern Iraq, overseen military operations at the Pentagon's Joint Staff and helped lead reviews into the Defense Department's ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy and the fatal shootings at Fort Hood, Tex.
His combat mettle was tested almost immediately. Within days of assuming command in March 2011, General Ham was leading the initial phase of the Libya air campaign, for which he earned high marks from his civilian bosses at the Pentagon and the White House.
But the general, who will retire this spring, acknowledged in one of three interviews during his recent trip to Niger that the command's ability to address the terrorist threat in Africa had been ''mixed.''
His grades? ''Pretty good'' in Somalia, where the Shabab, Islamist militants, have been dealt several setbacks in the past year. ''Less good'' in Libya, Mali and other parts of North and West Africa, where the United States is hunting Mokhtar Belmokhtar, a militant leader who claimed responsibility for the attack on a gas field in Algeria last month. And lacking in Nigeria, where an Islamist extremist group, Boko Haram, poses a major threat.
''Frankly, the intelligence community has not focused a lot on this part of the world,'' General Ham said. ''But we are starting to, out of necessity.''
With the war in Afghanistan winding down, senior Pentagon officials are scrambling to address the growing threat in North and West Africa by repositioning spy satellites and shifting surveillance aircraft from other theaters, all at a time when shrinking military budgets are forcing the Obama administration to make difficult choices on where to accept more risk.
The Pentagon is preparing to establish a drone base in Niger so that it can increase surveillance missions on the local Qaeda affiliate, Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, and associated groups. Starting this year, the Africa Command will also send small teams from a 4,000-member brigade in Kansas to conduct nearly 100 exercises and training programs in 35 African countries.
''We're going to see more and more demands on Africom,'' Hillary Rodham Clinton, then secretary of state, said in January.
As for Benghazi, General Ham said he did not request any additional forces to be on hand in the region for the anniversary of the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, saying there was no specific intelligence indicating an imminent attack.
He acknowledged that ''knowing what I know now would I make different decisions? Absolutely.'' A special emergency force, which all combatant commands have but that the Africa Command did not until Oct. 1, now splits time between Europe and its base in Colorado. General Ham said he is drawing up plans to have other forces in Europe, West Africa or Djibouti ready to respond quickly to a crisis.
''Instead of responding in a day,'' he said, ''they could respond within some number of hours.''
But with the Obama administration wary of putting American boots on the ground, General Ham and his lieutenants are sticking to the philosophy ''African solutions to African problems.''
''The underlying ethos remains the same: We're not looking to be the security provider for Africa,'' said Mr. Dell, General Ham's deputy.
American training programs have not always worked. As insurgents surged across Mali's northern desert last year, United States-trained commanders of the country's elite army units defected at a critical time, taking troops, trucks, weapons and their newfound skills to the enemy.
A confidential internal review completed last July by the Africa Command concluded that there were critical gaps in the American training for Malian troops and senior officers.
''We've focused exclusively on tactical and technical,'' General Ham said in a speech in January in Washington. ''We didn't spend probably the requisite time focusing on values, ethics and a military ethos that says when you put on the uniform of your nation, then you accept the responsibility to defend and protect that nation, to abide by the legitimate civilian authority.''
In Niger, officials reached a status-of-forces agreement in January that clears the way for greater American military involvement in the country, including the drone base.
''The U.S. should do more in the area training, equipment, land and air, and intelligence capability,'' Niger's president, Mahamadou Issoufou, said in an interview. ''African countries face threats beyond their means.''
General Ham insists that the command can carry out both combat operations and its original ''soft power'' missions, taking cues from envoys in the region like Bisa Williams, the United States ambassador in Niamey.
Ms. Williams said the command responded to her request a year ago to help train Niger's troops to improve relations with its citizens. The command ended other practices at her request, like financing the purchase of T-shirts urging Nigeriens to vote, money that could be better spent elsewhere, she said in an interview.
''That's what I need from you,'' Ms. Williams recalled General Ham telling her later. ''I need for you to tell me if we're tone deaf or in the wrong lane.''

Shooting in the Dark

BYLINE: By BENEDICT CAREY

SECTION: Section D; Column 0; Science Desk; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 1196 words

The young men who opened fire at Columbine High School, at the movie theater in Aurora, Colo., and in other massacres had this in common: they were video gamers who seemed to be acting out some dark digital fantasy. It was as if all that exposure to computerized violence gave them the idea to go on a rampage -- or at least fueled their urges.
But did it really?
Social scientists have been studying and debating the effects of media violence on behavior since the 1950s, and video games in particular since the 1980s. The issue is especially relevant today, because the games are more realistic and bloodier than ever, and because most American boys play them at some point. Girls play at lower rates and are significantly less likely to play violent games. 
A burst of new research has begun to clarify what can and cannot be said about the effects of violent gaming. Playing the games can and does stir hostile urges and mildly aggressive behavior in the short term. Moreover, youngsters who develop a gaming habit can become slightly more aggressive -- as measured by clashes with peers, for instance -- at least over a period of a year or two.
Yet it is not at all clear whether, over longer periods, such a habit increases the likelihood that a person will commit a violent crime, like murder, rape, or assault, much less a Newtown-like massacre. (Such calculated rampages are too rare to study in any rigorous way, researchers agree.)
''I don't know that a psychological study can ever answer that question definitively,'' said Michael R. Ward, an economist at the University of Texas, Arlington. ''We are left to glean what we can from the data and research on video game use that we have.''
The research falls into three categories: short-term laboratory experiments; longer-term studies, often based in schools; and correlation studies -- between playing time and aggression, for instance, or between video game sales and trends in violent crime.
Lab experiments confirm what any gamer knows in his gut: playing games like ''Call of Duty,'' ''Killzone 3'' or ''Battlefield 3'' stirs the blood. In one recent study, Christopher Barlett, a psychologist at Iowa State University, led a research team that had 47 undergraduates play ''Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance'' for 15 minutes. Afterward, the team took various measures of arousal, both physical and psychological. It also tested whether the students would behave more aggressively, by having them dole out hot sauce to a fellow student who, they were told, did not like spicy food but had to swallow the sauce.
Sure enough, compared with a group who had played a nonviolent video game, those who had been engaged in ''Mortal Kombat'' were more aggressive across the board. They gave their fellow students significantly bigger portions of the hot sauce.
Many similar studies have found the same thing: A dose of violent gaming makes people act a little more rudely than they would otherwise, at least for a few minutes after playing.
It is far harder to determine whether cumulative exposure leads to real-world hostility over the long term. Some studies in schools have found that over time digital warriors get into increasing numbers of scrapes with peers -- fights in the schoolyard, for example. In a report published last summer, psychologists at Brock University in Ontario found that longer periods of violent video game playing among high school students predicted a slightly higher number of such incidents over time.
''None of these extreme acts, like a school shooting, occurs because of only one risk factor; there are many factors, including feeling socially isolated, being bullied, and so on,'' said Craig A. Anderson, a psychologist at Iowa State University. ''But if you look at the literature, I think it's clear that violent media is one factor; it's not the largest factor, but it's also not the smallest.''
Most researchers in the field agree with Dr. Anderson, but not all of them. Some studies done in schools or elsewhere have found that it is aggressive children who are the most likely to be drawn to violent video games in the first place; they are self-selected to be in more schoolyard conflicts. And some studies are not able to control for outside factors, like family situation or mood problems.
''This is a pool of research that, so far, has not been very well done,'' said Christopher J. Ferguson, associate professor of psychology and criminal justice at Texas A&M International University and a critic of the field whose own research has found no link. ''I look at it and I can't say what it means.''
Neither Dr. Ferguson, nor others interviewed in this article, receive money from the gaming industry.
Many psychologists argue that violent video games ''socialize'' children over time, prompting them to imitate the behavior of the game's characters, the cartoonish machismo, the hair-trigger rage, the dismissive brutality. Children also imitate flesh and blood people in their lives, of course -- parents, friends, teachers, siblings -- and one question that researchers have not yet answered is when, exactly, a habit is so consuming that its influence trumps the socializing effects of other major figures in a child's life.
That is, what constitutes a bad habit? In surveys about 80 percent of high school-age boys say they play video games, most of which are thought to be violent, and perhaps a third to a half of those players have had a habit of 10 hours a week or more.
The proliferation of violent video games has not coincided with spikes in youth violent crime. The number of violent youth offenders fell by more than half between 1994 and 2010, to 224 per 100,000 population, according to government statistics, while video game sales have more than doubled since 1996.
In a working paper now available online, Dr. Ward and two colleagues examined week-by-week sales data for violent video games, across a wide range of communities. Violence rates are seasonal, generally higher in summer than in winter; so are video game sales, which peak during the holidays. The researchers controlled for those trends and analyzed crime rates in the month or so after surges in sales, in communities with a high concentrations of young people, like college towns.
''We found that higher rates of violent video game sales related to a decrease in crimes, and especially violent crimes,'' said Dr. Ward, whose co-authors were A. Scott Cunningham of Baylor University and Benjamin Engelstהtter of the Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim, Germany.
No one knows for sure what these findings mean. It may be that playing video games for hours every day keeps people off the streets who would otherwise be getting into trouble. It could be that the games provide ''an outlet'' that satisfies violent urges in some players -- a theory that many psychologists dismiss but that many players believe.
Or the two trends may be entirely unrelated.
''At the very least, parents should be aware of what's in the games their kids are playing,'' Dr. Anderson said, ''and think of it from a socialization point of view: what kind of values, behavioral skills, and social scripts is the child learning?''

Ruling Adds Another Chapter to Unsolved Italian Jet Crash

BYLINE: By ELISABETTA POVOLEDO

SECTION: Section ; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 

LENGTH: 848 words

ROME -- Itavia Flight 870 was entering the final leg of a routine domestic trip from Bologna to Palermo, Sicily, one clear summer evening when it suddenly plunged into the Tyrrhenian Sea near the small island of Ustica, killing all 81 people aboard.
Mechanical failure was ruled out early on, and almost 33 years later, the causes that led to the crash on June 27, 1980, are still a topic of passionate debate in Italy, fueled by three decades of inquiry boards, parliamentary commissions, countless expert reports and one of the longest judicial inquiries in recent Italian history. But despite all that, no formal charges have ever been filed in connection with the crash. 
The crash, known as the Ustica affair, has produced legions of conspiracy theories here, the way the Kennedy assassination -- or, on a lesser scale, the crash of TWA Flight 800 off Long Island in 1996 -- have in the United States. But in the Ustica affair, the case for a cover-up is far stronger.
Last week, when Italy's highest court ruled that the country's Defense and Transportation Ministries had to compensate the families of some of the victims, the court implicitly acknowledged the most widely accepted theory behind the crash: That a missile fired by a warplane had hit the twin-engine McDonnell Douglas DC-9 of Itavia, a now-defunct domestic Italian airline. But the court did not say where that missile came from.
To conspiracy buffs, it was vindication -- to a point.
''It's like the O.J. Simpson affair, where he got off in criminal court but was found guilty in a civil procedure and had to pay damages,'' said Andrea Purgatori, an investigative reporter whose exhaustive book on the disaster and the presumed cover-up was made into a 1992 film.
Over the years, several Italian Air Force officials have been investigated for withholding evidence -- wiping clean flight tracks and radar scans -- and four generals were tried on charges of treason and obstructing investigations. But no one has been convicted.
In this atmosphere, it is not surprising that conspiracy theories have proliferated over the years. The crash has been blamed on U.F.O.'s (several Web sites subscribe to this reconstruction) or domestic terrorism (the Bologna train station was bombed not five weeks later, killing 85 and wounding dozens more). In this scenario, the plane went down after a bomb exploded onboard, most likely in the toilet.
The missile theory gained a new impetus in 2008 when Francesco Cossiga, the prime minister at the time of the Ustica affair, said in an interview that the flight had been shot down by French military planes. Mr. Cossiga did not provide further details, nor can he. He died in 2010, at age 82.
At the time, proponents say, Italy was covertly allowing Libyan aircraft to fly through its airspace undisturbed. They did so by gliding in the slipstream of Italian domestic aircraft, where they could not be detected by radar. On the night of June 27, 1980, there were unsubstantiated reports that Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi was on one of those planes, the theory goes, and French forces tried to shoot it down to kill the Libyan leader, but hit the DC-9 by mistake. Don't ask why. It has to do with rebels in North Africa and jockeying for oil concessions between Italy and France.
But Colonel Qaddafi had been warned of the plan and never boarded his plane, according to this reconstruction, which also says the pilot made a successful emergency landing at sea. There, a British submarine reached it and deployed scuba divers to plant explosives to sink the plane and to silence potential witnesses to the assassination attempt.
One hypothesis, detailed by an investigative journalist, Claudio Gatti, holds that the plane was shot down by Israeli forces that mistook it for a plane carrying enriched uranium earmarked for Iraq. ''No country would attack in the Mediterranean for anything but extraordinary reasons,'' and Israel ''had that reason,'' Mr. Gatti said. ''It's the only scenario that makes sense.''
The Western warplane scenario has gathered weight through the years, as Italian prosecutors disclosed that several NATO planes were flying in the same airspace that night.
Prosecutors in Rome are still pursuing the Ustica affair. Several international rogatorie -- legal requests for information -- have since been sent to Belgium, France, Germany and the United States, but responses have been slow in coming, leading the victims' families to accuse those countries of dragging their feet.
Prosecutors say there are no time limits to such requests, which ''depend solely on the collaboration that countries see fit to give,'' said Erminio Amelio, one of the prosecutors currently leading the criminal investigation, which has passed through various hands over three decades.
Even though much has changed since that night in the Mediterranean almost 33 years ago, official sensitivities are still high, and no one expects any of the governments thought to be involved to come clean anytime soon.
''This is an incredible story, where a series of colossal lies have been told,'' Mr. Purgatori said.

Malian and French Troops Reassert Control in Key City

BYLINE: By PETER TINTI and ADAM NOSSITER. 
Peter Tinti reported from Gao, Mali, and Adam Nossiter from Dakar, Senegal

SECTION: Section ; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 

LENGTH: 726 words

GAO, Mali -- French and Malian troops appeared on Monday to have reasserted control of this strategic settlement in northern Mali after a protracted firefight with Islamist extremists who infiltrated the city after being chased from it two weeks ago.
Malian troops took up position on virtually every street corner on Monday and fresh bullet holes scarred a police headquarters, testimony to Sunday's fighting in Gao, which is at the edge of the desert and is the largest population center in the north. 
The battle between Islamist militants and a force of Malian and French troops, which continued for much of Sunday afternoon, suggested that the quick French campaign against the local Al Qaeda affiliate and its allies was not over.
Overnight, a series of explosions echoed in the early hours of Monday but the cause of the blasts was not immediately clear.
Sunday's attack by the Islamist fighters was the most serious escalation in the fighting since the French ended over six months of brutal Islamist occupation in Gao at the end of January. That victory came after a quick French bombing campaign and with barely a shot fired.
Continuous bursts of gunfire were heard around the police station, in the city's center and in southern districts as French helicopters hovered overhead. Malian soldiers fought back against Islamists armed with AK-47 rifles as the streets cleared of residents. French troops were also patrolling the city, which has a population of about 86,000, including its surrounding areas.
By late Sunday afternoon, the Islamist fighters had been encircled by French troops, according to a Gao municipal councilor, Abdheramane Oumarou. Later, Mr. Oumarou said that troops had launched a ''final assault'' on the town's police station, where Islamist fighters had taken refuge, and that it appeared to have been successful.
The Islamists' attack appeared to have begun with an attempted suicide bombing late Saturday night, when a militant on foot blew himself up at a Malian Army checkpoint outside of town, in the second such episode in two days. The bomber's attack, which wounded a Malian soldier, was merely a ruse to allow an Islamist commando unit to enter the city, Mr. Oumarou said.
''The Malian soldiers panicked; that's how the Mujao got into town,'' Mr. Oumaro said, referring to the Islamist group, the Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa, which is affiliated with Al Qaeda and controlled Gao from May to January. Mr. Oumarou said that the fighters who penetrated Gao were aided by local sympathizers, and that caches of armaments had been discovered by the local authorities.
A Malian Army spokesman said that the bomber was part of a commando team of about 20 Islamist fighters who assaulted a bridge in marshland linking Gao to neighboring villages.
The spokesman, Capt. Daouda Diarra, said the bomber appeared to be of Arab ancestry. He tried to penetrate the army checkpoint, the captain said, setting off his explosives.
''It's pretty hot in the town right now,'' said the mayor, Sadou H. Diallo, who was reached by phone on Sunday afternoon. ''I can't talk now.''
Though the French appeared to be leading the fight on Sunday, primary responsibility for patrols had been handed back to the Malian Army, which is still shaky after the defeats of last month that led the French to intervene, and still plagued by the internecine squabbles that led to a gun battle at a barracks in the capital, Bamako, on Friday.
Embarrassed by the recent events, Mali's interim president, Dioncounda Traorי, apologized to the country's foreign partners in a statement to the state news media. Mali is dependent on large-scale military assistance and other aid from overseas.
The explosion on Saturday night rocked the neighborhood. ''We were very scared,'' said a resident, Halimatou Tourי. ''There are lots of mujahedeen who come from this area,'' she said. The bomber's remains were removed in a wheelbarrow, and French armored vehicles took up positions at the checkpoint.
While Sunday's clashes showed that the northern cities are still vulnerable to attacks from Islamists, the bulk of their force is thought to have taken refuge in the Adrar des Ifoghas, a remote mountain range near Algeria and hundreds of miles to the north of Gao. Troops from France and Chad, supported by French aircraft, are pursuing the Islamists there as well.

Obama Awards Medal of Honor to Former Army Sergeant

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 18

LENGTH: 499 words

WASHINGTON -- Saluting Clinton Romesha for embodying the soldier's creed of never leaving behind a fallen comrade, President Obama on Monday bestowed the Medal of Honor on him for courageously defending a remote American outpost in eastern Afghanistan from a ferocious attack by more than 300 Taliban fighters. 
During the daylong attack on Combat Outpost Keating, the president said, Mr. Romesha, a 31-year-old Army staff sergeant, now retired, showed ''conspicuous gallantry'' in taking out an enemy machine-gun position, calling in airstrikes that killed 30 Taliban fighters, laying down covering fire to allow three soldiers to run to safety, and scrambling through a fusillade of enemy fire to recover the bodies of fallen American soldiers.
His bravery, Mr. Obama said, helped prevent the outpost from being overrun by Taliban fighters. He was wounded in the neck, shoulder and arms by shrapnel after a rocket-propelled grenade hit a generator he was hiding behind. Eight American service members were killed in the October 2009 battle, one of the most intense of the war.
Before draping the medal, the nation's highest military honor, around Mr. Romesha's neck, Mr. Obama recited the former sergeant's own words to an audience in the East Room of the White House that included military commanders, his family and other members of his company who had come under attack.
''We weren't going to be beat that day,'' Mr. Obama quoted him as saying. ''You're not going to back down in the face of adversity like that. We were just going to win -- plain and simple.''
Mr. Romesha stood solemnly next to the president, tearing up at times but also smiling slightly as Mr. Obama told the audience how Mr. Romesha's young son, Colin, had been racing around the Oval Office. He is the fourth living American soldier from the Afghanistan war to receive the Medal of Honor. He now works for an oil drilling company in North Dakota.
The heavy American losses at Combat Outpost Keating led the military to rethink its policy of placing garrisons in remote places, which was part of its broader counterinsurgency strategy. The outpost lay at the bottom of a deep valley, which allowed the Taliban fighters to take positions above it and pound it with mortars, rocket-propelled grenades and other fire. The United States abandoned it soon after the attack.
''There were many lessons from COP Keating,'' Mr. Obama declared. ''One of them is that our troops should never, ever, be put in a position where they have to defend the indefensible. But that's what these soldiers did -- for each other, in sacrifice driven by pure love.''
For his part, Mr. Romesha has expressed regret that he had not been able to save more of his buddies. Speaking to Jake Tapper, a CNN correspondent who has written a book about the battle, ''The Outpost: An Untold Story of American Valor,'' Mr. Romesha described a hellish scene.
''Everything was a target,'' he said, ''and I was trying to cover everything at once, as fast as I could.''

Struggling Nets Get Big Win Without Williams

BYLINE: By BEN STRAUSS

SECTION: Section B; Column 0; Sports Desk; NETS 89, PACERS 84, OVERTIME; Pg. 9

LENGTH: 703 words

INDIANAPOLIS -- Ninety minutes before his team was to play the Indiana Pacers, Nets General Manager Billy King met members of the New York news media in front of his team's bench to address the state of his reeling team.
First on the agenda was Deron Williams, the point guard and cornerstone of the franchise, who the Nets said Monday would miss two games to receive platelet-rich plasma treatment on his ankles. Then there were the six losses in the last nine games, the defeats coming by an average of 17.7 points. 
''We've had our peaks and valleys, our ebbs and flows,'' King said, at one point pulling out a handkerchief from his pocket and wiping sweat from his forehead. ''Right now, we're definitely in an ebb. Can we correct it? Yes.''
The Nets then backed up King's words with an 89-84 overtime victory against the first-place Pacers. Brook Lopez led the offense with 25 points, Reggie Evans controlled the glass, pulling down 22 rebounds, and point guard Tyshawn Taylor provided a huge boost off the bench.
For much of the night, it looked like a game that would fit neatly into the narrative for the Nets, who began 2013 by winning 10 of 11 games and running their record to 26-14 before falling on hard times.
The Nets (30-22) opened a 9-point lead in the fourth quarter only to see the Pacers come roaring back to grab a 76-72 lead when George Hill stole the ball from Gerald Wallace and went the length of the floor for a layup with less than two minutes to play. But two Nets free throws and a 10-foot jumper by Joe Johnson tied the score with 13 seconds to play and sent the game to overtime.
Taylor scored the Nets' first two baskets of overtime. Wallace drained a 3-pointer from the corner to give the Nets an 83-79 lead with less than two minutes to play, and the Nets held on.
With Williams out, the rookie Taylor -- and not the ineffective C. J. Watson -- picked up the slack at point guard. Taylor, a Kansas product, slashed to the basket effectively, both scoring and distributing the ball. He finished with 12 points and played 34 minutes. Watson, who had first crack at the point guard job, appeared out of sorts, shooting 0 for 7 from the field and scoring only a single point in 19 minutes.
''Honestly, I don't think he went into this game knowing I'm going to play Tyshawn 'X' amount of minutes,'' Taylor, who has played sparingly this season, said of Nets Coach P. J. Carlesimo. ''I kind of feel like he was going to put me out there to see how it went. If I play good, keep him in. If he doesn't, take him out.
''That's the situation I felt like I was in today and why I'm even happier, because I made the most of that.''
After a 111-86 loss to San Antonio on Sunday, the Nets showed a renewed energy that had been missing on the court and on their bench. They built up their fourth-quarter lead with a burst that began when Taylor missed a layup and Evans slammed home the rebound to give the Nets a 56-52 lead late in the third quarter.
''The only good thing about getting killed by San Antonio is the next day we beat one of the better teams in their own building,'' Carlesimo said. He added, ''I couldn't be prouder of the way we played.''
As for Williams's absence, it clouds not only the short-term outlook for the Nets, but also the long-term picture. Williams signed a five-year, $98 million contract during the off-season, but has struggled with ankle injuries since training camp. He has looked nothing like the player King has called the best point guard in the N.B.A.
King cited Williams's participation in last summer's Olympics and fatigue for what the team is calling synovitis, an ailment that has inflamed the linings of Williams's ankle joints. King insisted that Williams's health was not a structural issue and would not harm his career.
''Let's not the put the dirt on him and say his career is over at 28,'' King said.
King watched much of the game leaning on a railing in the tunnel that leads from the court to the locker rooms. He alternately checked his phone, chatted with fans and monitored the action on the court. He smiled when the Nets scored, but replaced it with a look of consternation when his team's fortunes changed.
When the final buzzer sounded, he was smiling again.

The 'Die Hard' Quandary

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; OP-ED COLUMNIST; Pg. 31

LENGTH: 787 words

Later this week, the fifth installment of the ''Die Hard'' movies is scheduled to open in theaters across the country. ''A Good Day to Die Hard'' stars, once again, Bruce Willis as John McClane, a too-stubborn-for-his-own-good cop who has to stop a highly trained army of bad guys out to wreak destruction and death. It will undoubtedly be a giant hit for Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, the owner of the ''Die Hard'' franchise.
In promoting the new movie, both the Regal and AMC movie chains are holding ''Die Hard'' marathons on Wednesday. Starting at noon, an AMC theatergoer can spend 12 straight hours watching all five ''Die Hard'' movies. 
That's a lot of ''Die Hard.'' Among the guns used -- and used, and used, and used -- in just the first ''Die Hard'' are a Steyr AUG assault rifle, a Heckler & Koch MP5 submachine gun, and a Walther PPK pistol with silencer. McClane himself relies on a Beretta 92 semiautomatic pistol in the first three movies, and a Sig Sauer P220 in the more recent films. (He also favors the bald look in the last two movies.)
Of course, it is cartoonish violence, in the sense that rarely -- in all the innumerable killings -- is blood seen pouring out of the victims, or does anyone cry out in anguish and pain. Incredibly, the Motion Picture Association of America judges foul language to be more problematic for children than this kind of bloodless violence, which perhaps explains why the 2007 installment, ''Live Free or Die Hard,'' was rated PG-13: the normally foul-mouthed McClane barely swears in it. (The new one has reclaimed its traditional R.)
What got me thinking about ''Die Hard'' -- and guns in the movies more generally -- is, of course, the furious gun debate since the killings in Newtown, Conn. On one side are those who believe we can cut down on gun violence by, among other things, banning the assault weapons that always seem to be used in mass shootings.
On the other side are the Second Amendment absolutists, who argue that the real problem is the culture, soaked in so much violent imagery that it is virtually impossible to avoid. They add that a ban on assault weapons would be the beginning of a slippery slope that would ultimately lead to a ban on weapons of every kind.
It's not that I don't want to see a ban on assault weapons. I sincerely do. But after poking around the world of gun-crazed movies and other media, I have to say, the Second Amendment absolutists have a point. For instance, when you ask a spokesman for the M.P.A.A. about the real-world effect of gun imagery in the movies, he actually pushes back by claiming that ''there is a predominance of findings that show there is no consistent or convincing evidence that exposure causes people to be more violent.''
This is, quite simply, untrue. ''There is tons of research on this,'' says Joanne Cantor, professor emerita of communications at the University of Wisconsin, and an expert on the effect of violent movies and video games. ''Watching violence makes kids feel they can use violence to solve a problem. It brings increased feelings of hostility. It increases desensitization.'' Every parent understands this instinctively, of course, but those instincts are backed by decades of solid research.
There is a second reason many people -- indeed, many of the same people who would like to ban assault weapons -- shrink from demanding changes in the culture's tolerance for violent images. To do anything about it legislatively would likely violate the First Amendment. Just as an assault weapon ban is the slippery slope for Second Amendment advocates, efforts to restrict violent images -- or pornography, for that matter -- is the slippery slope for First Amendment absolutists.
Craig Anderson, a psychologist at Iowa State University, told me that children who watch even something as seemingly benign as Woody Woodpecker cartoons -- in which Woody often pecks on someone's head -- can become temporarily more aggressive. ''If you are going to start to ban media violence, where do you stop?'' he asked.
Violent video games and movies, he went on to say, are certainly not the only factor that can lead someone to commit an act of gun violence. ''If someone has no other risk factors, he can play Grand Theft Auto all day and never commit a violent act. But if he has a number of the other risk factors. ...'' Anderson let the thought hang.
On Monday, I called an AMC spokesman to ask if his company was worried about its customers watching nonstop shootings for 12 straight hours.
''We are very excited about the 'Die Hard' marathon,'' he replied. ''It will be a great time for our guests.'' He added, however, that the company had its ''security measures in place.''
Just, you know, in case.

At Texas Service, Mourners Remember Slain Ex-Sniper as Warrior and Family Man

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ; Kathryn Jones contributed reporting.

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 13

ARLINGTON, Tex. -- Military leaders, law enforcement officials and thousands of others gathered at Cowboys Stadium here on Monday to remember Chris Kyle, the retired Navy SEAL sniper and author who was killed with another man, investigators say, by a troubled veteran he was trying to help.
In a tribute filled with prayers, eulogies and country tunes sung by Randy Travis, friends and fellow SEAL members remembered Mr. Kyle, 38, as the military's deadliest sniper, a Navy man who hated the water and a devoted father who walked away from his military career to spend more time with his wife and two children, ages 8 and 6. 
''God knew it would take the toughest and softest-hearted man on earth to get a hardheaded, cynical, hard-loving woman like me to see what God needed me to see, and he chose you for the job,'' Mr. Kyle's wife, Taya Kyle, told the audience. ''He chose well.''
On Feb. 2, Mr. Kyle and his friend Chad Littlefield took the veteran, Eddie Ray Routh, 25, to a remote shooting range in Erath County. According to the authorities, Mr. Routh turned his weapon on the two men, shooting and killing them before fleeing in Mr. Kyle's truck.
Investigators believe that Mr. Kyle, an expert marksman who survived four tours of duty in Iraq and became known for spotting enemy targets at extraordinary distances, was gunned down at point-blank range by a mentally ill young man he had tried to befriend and help, as he had many other veterans struggling to adjust to life at home.
In the hours before and after his arrest, Mr. Routh told relatives and investigators that he killed Mr. Kyle and Mr. Littlefield. Court documents suggest he may have done so because he believed the two men were trying to kill him. Mr. Routh remains at the Erath County Jail and faces capital murder charges. He and his relatives had told the police in recent weeks and months that he was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.
On Monday, Mr. Routh's name was never spoken during the two-hour service, which a Cowboys spokesman said was attended by roughly 7,000 people. Relatives and friends sat at the 50-yard line as pictures of Mr. Kyle were displayed on a giant screen. Many of the mourners were Texans who had never met Mr. Kyle. On the stage, a helmet and vest were draped on a cross behind a pair of boots and two rifles. His coffin rested at the center of the field. Motorcycle riders in leather jackets stood at attention at the sidelines holding American flags.
One Navy SEAL member, who spoke anonymously, described Mr. Kyle as the epitome of the team's ethos. ''Will every Frogman, past and present, please stand,'' he said. After a number of men in suits and Naval uniforms rose, he recited the SEAL creed.
In a funeral procession planned for Tuesday, Mr. Kyle's body will be carried 200 miles from Midlothian, the Dallas suburb where he attended high school and returned years later to live with his wife and children, to Austin. He will be buried there at the Texas State Cemetery.
In Iraq, Mr. Kyle was known for protecting American troops while perched on a rooftop with a bolt-action rifle, describing his use of deadly skill as payback for the 9/11 attacks.
Back at home, Mr. Kyle, the author of ''American Sniper: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History,'' continued to protect troops by other means. He helped create the nonprofit Fitco Cares Foundation to help veterans overcome post-traumatic stress disorder by providing exercise equipment and counseling. Though his book became a best seller, he never collected money from it, friends said, donating the proceeds to the families of two friends and fallen SEAL members, Ryan Job and Marc Lee.
''I was speechless, overwhelmed and in tears,'' Mr. Lee's mother, Debbie Lee, told the audience about the day she learned of the donation. ''Chris didn't publish that book for an income or to be famous. He hated the spotlight. Chris did that for his teammates.''
Mr. Kyle grew up raising cows for the National FFA Organization. In high school, he planned to become a county agricultural agent, but joined the Navy instead. He was still in training in San Diego in 2001 when he met his wife, Taya.
In a passage she wrote for his book, she recalled telling Mr. Kyle that she thought SEAL personnel were ''arrogant, self-centered and glory-seeking.''
''I would lay down my life for my country,'' she recalled him responding. ''How is that self-centered?'' They talked some more, and finally Mr. Kyle announced that he was going home. ''Well, you were saying about how you never would date a SEAL or go out with one,'' he told her. ''Oh no,'' she replied, ''I said I would never marry one. I didn't say I wouldn't go out with one.''
They married not long after, and had a son and a daughter.
As Mrs. Kyle spoke Monday, a Marine in uniform stood by her, providing encouragement and, at one point when she needed a tissue, his white glove. She spoke to her children, her sobs echoing through the silent stadium. ''So, my sweet angels, we will put one foot in front of the other,'' she said.
At the end of the service, Mr. Kyle's wife and children walked hand in hand behind the uniformed pallbearers as the sound of bagpipes filled the stadium.

U.N. Fact-Finding Team to Visit Site of South Sudan Killings

BYLINE: By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 8

LENGTH: 636 words

NAIROBI, Kenya -- The United Nations is sending a fact-finding team to the site of a recent massacre in a remote region of South Sudan where more than 100 people may have been killed, United Nations officials said Monday.
South Sudan, Africa's newest country, is struggling with a number of serious security issues, including bombing along the border of Sudan, violent protests in some areas and ethnically driven clashes in others. 
On Friday, heavily armed militiamen from the Murle ethnic group ambushed a large gathering of Lou Nuer villagers making their way with their cattle to a river, the local authorities said. Preliminary estimates from local officials indicate that 103 people were killed -- mostly women, children and elderly people unable to run away.
The raiders also took all the cattle and kidnapped dozens of children. Officials said that a platoon of government soldiers had tried to fight off the raiders, but that more than a dozen soldiers had been killed.
A deadly feud between the two groups has been raging for years, exacerbated by a simmering proxy war between South Sudan and Sudan. South Sudanese officials said Monday that there was evidence that the Sudanese government was arming Murle militias and that villagers had seen planes dropping crates of guns and ammunition to David Yau Yau, a fugitive Murle rebel leader who has been hiding out by the Ethiopian border, organizing attacks against civilians and government forces.
''He's part of a destabilizing strategy of Khartoum,'' said Col. Philip Aguer, the spokesman for South Sudan's military.
Officials in Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, have denied arming rebels in South Sudan and leveled the same type of allegations against the South Sudanese. They contend that South Sudan has been helping rebels in Darfur and the Nuba Mountains, two restive regions of Sudan. Most independent analysts believe that both Sudan and South Sudan, which broke off from Sudan in 2011, have provided covert aid to militias on the opposite sides of the border.
In South Sudan, especially in Jonglei State, a vast, swampy hinterland where the Murle, Dinka and Lou Nuer have clashed over land and cattle for years, ethnic grievances can be set off easily. The Murle are a relatively small group and have long complained about being marginalized and discriminated against. The Lou Nuer, on the other hand, supply thousands of soldiers to South Sudan's army and are considered more a part of the political establishment.
In late December 2011, thousands of Lou Nuer attacked Murle civilians, killing hundreds. Murle leaders complained that United Nations peacekeepers and the South Sudanese national forces had abandoned them in their hour of need and simply stood by. In one place, an entire family was executed together, the bodies discovered facedown in the swamp grass.
Kouider Zerrouk, a spokesman for the United Nations mission in South Sudan, said that since that attack, ''in general, it was stable, until this incident.''
Mr. Zerrouk said that a team of United Nations officials was traveling Monday to the site of the massacre, several hours' walk from the small town of Walgak in a thickly forested area of Jonglei State. The United Nations team, along with South Sudanese officials, will ''assess the situation and ascertain the facts,'' he said.
Kuol Manyang Juuk, the governor of Jonglei State, described the Murle as pastoralists with a history of raiding cattle from their neighbors, partly as a way to survive in a harsh environment.
''This has been their way of life all along,'' he said Monday by telephone from Bor, the state capital.
The only long-term solution to this feud, the governor said, is roads.
''Roads will allow the security forces to move and will introduce trade,'' he said. ''This is about development. What we need is development.''

Ruling Islamists, Under Attack, Reject Blame for Tunisia's Woes

BYLINE: By KAREEM FAHIM; Farah Samti contributed reporting.

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; MEMO FROM TUNIS; Pg. 4

LENGTH: 923 words

TUNIS -- Facing public anger and internal divisions after the assassination of an opposition leader, Tunisia's largest Islamist party, which leads a governing coalition, blamed the news media, secular elites and the remnants of the old government for its troubles.
As Tunisians fretted about the specter of political violence, the party, Ennahda, did not seem to look inward. It strongly condemned the assassination, but did not see any blame for the anger in its own actions. But others did. 
Its implacable critics renewed their charge that the killing was the result of Ennahda's conservative religious agenda. Others, including supporters of the group, said the movement's own missteps since coming to power contributed to the public outburst after the politician Chokri Belaid was gunned down last week. The group had lost confidence, some said, by focusing on power rather than on governing.
As tens of thousands took to the streets last week and Tunisia's divisions were laid bare, many waited to see how Ennahda would respond. Would it reach out to find common ground with some of its critics, or would it retreat to its base of support? The challenge resonates here and in Egypt, where the Muslim Brotherhood is facing even harsher questions about its rule.
Ennahda's leader, Rachid al-Ghannouchi, dismissed the criticism, saying that the movement remained popular and that a majority of Tunisians were not afraid of his group. ''Just a tiny part of the aristocracy,'' he said.
Nevertheless, the anger amounted to a humbling setback for Ennahda, which had been in the vanguard of Islamists seeking political power after the Arab uprisings two years ago and had held up its record of building political consensus as a model. After decades of being jailed, or forced underground or into exile by authoritarian leaders, the Islamist groups' rise to power in Egypt and Tunisia has been swift. So has the reckoning on their rule.
''They thought that governing would be easy,'' said Abou Yaareb Marzouki, a philosophy professor who is close to Ennahda. ''And they imagined that through governance, they will reject forced modernism,'' he said, referring to what he called a policy of westernization under colonial rulers and authoritarian governments. But Ennahda and the Brotherhood had swung too far in the opposite direction, he suggested, imposing ''forced easternization.''
Since the uprising against President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali two years ago, Ennahda has insisted that whatever the results of elections, it would rule with others and had no intention of imposing a conservative religious agenda. After winning a plurality in Tunisia's first elections, the party formed a coalition with the center left.
Facing challenges that would test any government, the coalition became noted for its incompetence, failing to dent the economic crisis or reform institutions.
Ennahda was accused of coddling ultraconservatives, known as Salafis, some of whom have been tied to a string of violent episodes.
The blame intensified after the killing of Mr. Belaid, who had received death threats for his criticisms of Islamists. At his funeral on Friday, tens of thousands of mourners directed their anger at Ennahda and Mr. Ghannouchi, blaming them for fostering extremism and taunting the leader with an incendiary chant: ''Slaughterer.''
Intensifying the pressure on Ennahda, the prime minister, Hamadi Jebali -- a top Ennahda leader -- defied his colleagues by calling for the Islamist-led cabinet to replaced by technocrats with no political affiliations. Ennahda said it was still considering whether to accept the proposal to reconstitute the government, which many people believe could quiet some of the anger.
In an interview on Saturday, Mr. Ghannouchi said Tunisia's difficulties could be ''contained,'' saying he was not worried that the country would devolve into violence. ''The Tunisian people are known for being peaceful,'' he said.
He said he was surprised at the accusations against Ennahda, which understood that its success in governing depended on stability. ''These kinds of things happen in revolutions,'' he said, speaking of the assassination. He avoided Mr. Belaid's funeral to ''avoid tensions,'' he said, but was clearly stung by the chants against him, which he called part of a demonization campaign.
Mr. Ghannouchi said the party remained ''open and accepting,'' and said most people were not preoccupied with ideological conflict but with concerns like food and medicine. He blamed a ''French model of secularism'' for conflicts in Tunisia, and insisted that no more than 20 percent of Tunisians were opposed to Islamist rule. ''The rest are against radical secularism,'' he said.
Khalil al-Anani, a scholar of Middle East Studies at Durham University in England, said the Islamists shared a misconception that by securing electoral victories, they were free to act as they wished. ''They replicate the policies of authoritarian regimes, and underestimate the weight of secular and liberal forces.'' And they did not understand how the uprisings had changed the structures of power. ''No one can claim the authority of the street in the Arab world,'' he said.
Abdulbasset Belhassan, the president of the Tunis-based Arab Institute for Human Rights, said the Islamists ''are facing a strategic choice -- between keeping an ideological approach based on their old legacy, or entering a new era based on human rights and democracy.'' ''They should take a historical decision,'' he said. ''The revolution was not made by one party.''

9 P.M. (ABC, Bloomberg, CBS, CNBC, CNN, C-Span, Fox, Fox Business, Fox News, MSNBC, NBC, 11, 13, 49) STATE OF THE UNION President Obama is expected to focus on restoring prosperity to the middle class and will unveil initiatives in education, infrastructure, clean energy and manufacturing, according to White House officials. He will also try to summon support for the passage of stricter gun laws and an overhaul of immigration policy. And he will confront the looming battle with Congress over his call to lower the deficit by cutting spending on Medicare, stabilizing Social Security and revamping the tax code. 
1:30 P.M. (Starz) COCO BEFORE CHANEL (2009) Audrey Tautou portrays Gabrielle Chanel, and Marie Gillain is her sister Adrienne in this chronicle of the early life of the woman who would become perhaps the single most influential figure in 20th-century fashion. The story begins in an orphanage, where the girls have been left by their father, and continues as they make their way to a provincial music hall, in which they specialize in naughty songs while trying not to be mistaken for prostitutes, and on to the well-heeled men they, as women without money or status, find to keep them. ''With a mixture of brutal candor and tender sympathy, it charts the rise of an ambitious, difficult woman, taking note of the obstacles and opportunities offered by her time, place and circumstances,'' A. O. Scott said in The New York Times about the film, which was directed by Anne Fontaine, also one of its screenwriters. Mr. Scott noted that ''Ms. Tautou's fierce and sinewy performance represents a decisive break with the dimpled-pixie typecasting she has been struggling against since 'Amיlie.' '' He added: ''Coco disdains corsets, sometimes dresses in men's garments, and adapts simple hats and fishermen's shirts to marvelously chic effect. The blossoming of her ambition, as much as her love life, drives the story forward, and turns 'Coco Before Chanel' into a costume drama worthy of the name.''
7:30 P.M. (HBO) BOBBY McFERRIN: A YOUNGARTS MASTERCLASS For more than 30 years YoungArts, a program of the National Foundation for Advancement in the Arts, has offered scholarships and mentoring to emerging high school artists. This latest installment of the Emmy-nominated ''Masterclass'' series, directed by the Oscar-winning filmmakers Karen Goodman and Kirk Simon and featuring sessions between acclaimed artists and students, focuses on Mr. McFerrin, the Grammy-winning vocalist whose repertory spans jazz, pop and classical music. Here he prepares four young singers -- Aaron Casey, Christine Jones, Ryan McCartan and Hannah Zazzaro -- to accompany him in a concert at the Festspielhaus in Baden-Baden, Germany. Their first challenge: to sing ''Swing Low, Sweet Chariot'' in their own styles, then ''mess it up,'' he says, as he improvises with them. ''To me, the stage is a platform for adventure,'' he adds, ''and I think they got a taste of what that feels like.''
8 P.M. (USA) THE 137TH WESTMINSTER KENNEL CLUB SHOW The Treeing Walker Coonhound and the Russell Terrier become the latest additions to the American Kennel Club's list of more than 170 recognized purebreds at this event held at Madison Square Garden. The judging on this second night continues with the sporting, working and terrier groups, followed by best in show. David Frei and Mary Carillo are the hosts. Above, Aristocrat the St. Bernard.
8:30 P.M. (TV5Monde) LE BONHEUR (1965) In her first color film, now a French New Wave classic, the director Agnטs Varda dissects amour in this tale of a happily married carpenter (Jean-Claude Drouot), who betrays his wife (Claire Drouot, his real spouse, below with Mr. Drouot) and two children (played by their own children) by having an affair with a postal clerk (Marie France Boyer). But, finding it difficult to keep a secret from the woman he still loves, he decides to tell her all. Writing in The Times, A. H. Weiler said ''it is both a memorable and exasperating view of the male and female animals -- awash in familiar togetherness, sacred sex and frank adultery -- that makes it at once joyful and moving but crucially immature, disturbing and tragic.''
9 P.M. (Oxygen) THE FACE Twelve aspiring models, divided into teams overseen by Naomi Campbell, Karolina Kurkova and Coco Rocha, move into a loft together before tackling their initial assignment: to create an image worthy of W magazine. But two coaches come to verbal blows when the first woman is eliminated. Nigel Barker hosts this new series, the winner of which will represent the retail chain ULTA Beauty. KATHRYN SHATTUCK

Brooklyn Man Convicted Of Killing Officer in 2011

BYLINE: By MOSI SECRET

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 26

LENGTH: 553 words

A Brooklyn man who shot and killed a New York City police officer during a botched drug robbery was convicted of second-degree murder on Monday but acquitted of the most serious murder charge, suggesting that jurors had doubts about whether he intentionally killed the officer.
The man, Lamont Pride, shot Officer Peter Figoski in the face as he fled the scene of a robbery in Cypress Hills, Brooklyn, in December 2011, the first fatal shooting of a New York police officer in the line of duty since 2007. 
During the three-week trial in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, prosecutors tried to prove that the shooting was intentional, introducing testimony from a member of Mr. Pride's robbery crew who said Mr. Pride cocked his handgun before storming into the home, and playing a videotaped statement from Mr. Pride in which he seemed to change his story in response to different questions.
Mr. Pride's lawyer, James Koenig, argued that the shooting was an accident -- the tragic result of a slip of the finger in a moment of panic.
The verdict acquitted Mr. Pride, 28, of aggravated murder but found him guilty of second-degree murder and other charges, including burglary and aggravated manslaughter. He faces 45 years to life in prison when he is sentenced on Feb. 28. A conviction on the more-serious charge would have carried a mandatory life sentence.
After a trial that was filled with emotion -- each day's testimony was attended by Officer Figoski's family, including his four daughters, and more than a dozen fellow officers -- the announcement of the verdict provoked only a subdued response. Several officers gasped audibly, and Mr. Figoski's mother, Mary Ann Figoski, quietly covered her mouth. Mr. Pride showed little emotion.
Outside the courtroom, Mr. Koenig gave the verdict measured praise. ''For Lamont, this was the best-case scenario,'' he said. ''This case was not a victory for anyone.''
Patrick J. Lynch, president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, said that the jury found reasonable doubt where there was none. ''To say the least, we're disappointed and angry,'' Mr. Lynch said. ''This clown intended on killing Peter Figoski, period.''
The jurors did not speak to reporters after the verdict.
Officer Figoski, a 22-year veteran of the Police Department, and his partner, Officer Glenn Estrada, had answered a call for assistance at a robbery at 25 Pine Street in Cypress Hills, near the Queens border. They found a victim who was beaten and bloodied in the basement apartment and tended to him, not knowing that Mr. Pride and one of his associates were hiding in the basement's shadows. Mr. Pride burst into view and, during a quick confrontation with Officer Figoski, shot the officer in the face.
Officer Estrada chased down Mr. Pride and apprehended him several blocks away.
Mr. Pride was tried with Michael Velez, who prosecutors said was the getaway driver that night. A separate jury is considering second-degree murder charges against Mr. Velez and is expected to begin deliberations this week.
Two other men who prosecutors said were there that night, Kevin Santos and Nelson Morales, are expected to be tried on murder charges later this year. And a fifth, Ariel Tejada, who testified against Mr. Pride, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and robbery, and was sentenced to 18 years.

Divesting Gun Stocks

SECTION: Section ; Column 0; Editorial Desk; LETTER; Pg. 

LENGTH: 233 words

To the Editor:
Alicia H. Munnell's Feb. 1 Op-Ed essay, ''A Pension for Security, Not Politics,'' suggested that divesting from firearms companies is a political statement with little real-world impact. This assessment is not only mistaken, but also ignores the role of pension funds as long-term stewards of educators' deferred wages. 
Cerberus Capital made news in December when it announced its intention to sell Freedom Group, the gun company whose rifle was used in the massacre in Newtown, Conn.
One of the events precipitating this was the concern expressed by the California State Teachers' Retirement System, known as CalSTRS, over Cerberus's stake in Freedom Group. CalSTRS's action was based on its fiduciary responsibility to act in the best interests of the more than 856,000 educators and school personnel participating in the plan.
CalSTRS's decision represents a greater readiness by banks, insurance companies and other institutional investors to recognize their growing exposure to environmental, social and governmental risks.
Teachers devote their careers to improving the lives of children and our society as a whole. Investing teachers' money in companies that make products damaging to our children and our society would fail to honor the special duty of trust placed on the stewards of workers' capital.

Politics in Bangladesh Jolted by Daily Demonstrations

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY; Julfikar Ali Manik contributed reporting from Dhaka, Bangladesh.

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 4

LENGTH: 830 words

NEW DELHI -- Huge daily demonstrations in the heart of Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, are upending the nation's politics and illustrating how heavily the country's bloody past still weighs on its present. Thousands of protesters, most of them college students and other young people, demonstrated again on Tuesday, fueled by broad public anger over a recent ruling by the country's special war crimes tribunal that they say was too lenient.
Though the protests have been peaceful, a gunfight erupted in another part of Dhaka on Tuesday when followers of Jamaat-e-Islami, the country's largest Islamic political party, vandalized vehicles and clashed with the police. Earlier in the day, the Bangladeshi government had rejected a request by Jamaat leaders to stage a counterprotest against the youth demonstrations. 
For more than two years, the Bangladeshi government has been prosecuting defendants accused of atrocities during the country's 1971 war of independence from Pakistan. On Feb. 5, the special tribunal hearing the cases convicted Abdul Quader Mollah, 65, now a leader of the Jamaat party, on charges of rape and mass murder and sentenced him to life in prison.
Within hours of the verdict, protesters gathered at Shahbagh, a major intersection in the center of the capital near Dhaka University. Their message was loud and clear: they thought the life sentence was too lenient, possibly the result of a political deal, and they demanded that Mr. Mollah be sentenced to death. Protesters waved torches and banners and chanted slogans like ''Joy Bangla.''
''We were really surprised'' at the large turnout the first day, said Imran H. Sarkar, one of the organizers. ''But young people were very concerned.'' Last weekend, the crowds swelled to 200,000 or more by some estimates.
Protests and strikes, common in Dhaka, are often coordinated and organized by political parties. But the Shahbagh protests, as the demonstrations over the verdict have come to be known, were organized by bloggers and have attracted poets, artists, social activists and untold numbers of other citizens. Related protests are being held in other cities.
The protesters have directed their ire at Jamaat-e-Islami, which has been accused of opposing independence and collaborating with Pakistani forces during the 1971 war, charges the party has denied. At the Shahbagh protests, thousands of people pledged to boycott the Jamaat party and its related businesses, and a delegation of protest leaders presented the Bangladeshi Parliament with a list of demands, including that laws be changed so that Mr. Mollah's life sentence can be appealed.
Political analysts in Bangladesh say the youth demonstrations reflect broad public disenchantment with the usual style of Bangladeshi politics. Debapriya Bhattacharya, a Bangladeshi economist and former United Nations diplomat, said the demands for tough sentencing reflected a broader public desire for closure on the 1971 war, in which rapes and assaults of women were common and an estimated three million people were killed.
''There is a general understanding among the people that they want justice in the case,'' said Mr. Bhattacharya, who is now a senior fellow at the Center for Policy Dialogue, a leading research institute in Dhaka. ''And somehow, at the end of the day here, justice is about capital punishment.''
The protests, he said, are entwined with a rising patriotism among many young Bangladeshis, who are proud of their country's progress even as they often distrust the established political parties. ''This is something different and something new,'' Mr. Bhattacharya said of the protests. ''This is the rise of a new social force that can change the political calculus in the country.''
The Awami League, the political party leading the national government, now faces political pressure from opposing directions. The Shahbagh protesters are complaining that the recent verdict is too lenient, while opposition parties, including the Jamaat party, have accused the government of manipulating the tribunal to ensure convictions of their leaders.
One justice has resigned from the tribunal over irregularities in its work. Before its verdict on Feb. 5, Jamaat and other opposition parties staged huge protests against the tribunal's proceedings; they sought to renew those protests on Tuesday, but the government denied their request. Tensions are expected to remain high as the tribunal issues more verdicts in coming weeks.
The scattered violence on Tuesday occurred about a mile from the Shahbagh protest site. Followers of Jamaat and members of its youth wing were photographed smashing vehicles and clashing with security officers. Officials say that the Jamaat followers opened fire with machine guns and that the police responded with rubber bullets.
Bangladeshi news media reported that at least 10 people were injured by the rubber bullets, and that members of the Jamaat youth wing were seen firing weapons and throwing fire bombs.

One of two men charged with killing a 15-year-old majorette from Chicago who performed at President Obama's inauguration last month told the police that he shot her because ''she was just there'' as he targeted a rival gang, prosecutors said on Tuesday. The man, Michael Ward, 18, was charged on Monday with first-degree murder and attempted murder in the shooting of the girl, Hadiya Pendleton, as was Kenneth Williams, 20. Prosecutors said the murder was a case of mistaken identity. Police officials said Mr. Ward, a member of the Su-Wu gang, had given a videotaped confession saying he rode in his mother's car with Mr. Williams looking for members of the rival 4-6 Terror gang. Mr. Ward said that Ms. Pendleton ''had nothing to do with it,'' officials said. Mr. Williams is accused of providing the gun to Mr. Ward and pointing out a group of young people, including Ms. Pendleton, at a South Side park, prosecutors said.

Fugitive Ex-Officer Is Believed Dead in Cabin

BYLINE: By IAN LOVETT, JENNIFER MEDINA, MICHAEL WILSON and FERNANDA SANTOS; Ian Lovett reported from Big Bear Lake, Jennifer Medina from Los Angeles, Michael Wilson from New York, and Fernanda Santos from San Bernardino, Calif. Rebecca Fairley Raney contributed reporting from Big Bear Lake.

BIG BEAR LAKE, Calif. -- After a shootout and a forest standoff on Tuesday afternoon, Christopher J. Dorner, the former Los Angeles police officer sought in the region's largest manhunt, was apparently killed in a cabin as it burned down around him, but officials said they needed time to sort through the rubble.
Mr. Dorner, a self-described survivalist believed to be heavily armed, had holed up in the rental cabin hours earlier and engaged deputies in a shootout, killing one deputy and wounding a second.
The dramatic chain of events, which included hostage taking and a chase in vehicles and on foot, played out in the sun-dappled, snowy San Bernardino Mountains. 
It was unclear how the fire at the cabin began, but the authorities said that no one escaped the blaze and that Mr. Dorner was believed to be alone inside.
Officers, shouting orders through loudspeakers for Mr. Dorner to surrender, heard what they believed to be a single gunshot from within.
News organization widely reported that Mr. Dorner's body was found in the building, but a spokesman from the Los Angeles Police Department said on Tuesday evening that they did not have the body.
Even after officers retrieve the body, it could take days or weeks to identify it, officials said. Cindy Bachman, a spokeswoman for the San Bernardino County sheriff, said in an evening news conference, ''We believe that he was still inside the cabin,'' but that it was not safe to enter because of the heat.
Both the suspect and the police were believed to have used smoke grenades during the shootout. The two deputies who were shot were airlifted to Loma Linda University Medical Center; the second deputy's condition was not disclosed on Tuesday evening, but he was expected to recover.
The standoff drew scores of police officers and sheriff's deputies from surrounding jurisdictions, led by the San Bernardino Sheriff-Coroner Department. The tension heightened as the day wore on, and local schools were locked down.
Law enforcement agencies ordered news helicopters to keep their distance for the protection of the officers involved. The sheriff's online feed to the department's radio scanner was shut down for the same reason. Reporters were asked to stop posting updates on Twitter.
The police believed that Mr. Dorner was monitoring the news, and Cmdr. Andrew Smith, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department, addressed him directly at a news briefing on Tuesday afternoon.
''Enough is enough,'' Commander Smith said. ''It's time to stop the bloodshed and let this incident be over.''
Officers had been searching the Big Bear area since last week, when Mr. Dorner's burning truck was found on a forest road. Mr. Dorner, a former reservist in the Navy, had boasted about his sharpshooting and survival abilities.
Days ago, Mr. Dorner apparently broke into a couple's home on Club View Drive, the authorities said on Tuesday. The street is nestled beside a golf course in a community called Moonridge near Big Bear Lake. Mr. Dorner reportedly tied them up as his hostages and stayed out of sight until Tuesday afternoon.
Shortly after 12 p.m. Tuesday, the authorities received a report of a stolen white pickup truck and a description that fit Mr. Dorner's. Soon after, he was spotted driving a white 2005 Dodge pickup by an officer with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. The suspect was driving toward the officer in the opposite lane, said Andrew Hughan, a spokesman for the department. The officer recognized Mr. Dorner, stepped out of his vehicle and fired at the suspect, who returned fire. Neither was injured, Mr. Hughan said.
The officer and a colleague chased the man, who crashed the pickup, fired at them and ran into the cabin.
More officers arrived and surrounded the cabin, and more gunfire was exchanged. Mr. Dorner fired out a window of the cabin before trying to flee from the rear, throwing a smoke bomb to hide his escape, but police gunfire drove him back inside, The Los Angeles Times reported. The newspaper also reported that deputies used smoke bombs to cover their evacuation of the fallen deputies.
At the news briefing, Commander Smith said the Los Angeles Police Department had officers ready to be deployed from the San Bernardino airport, several miles from the cabin. He said the San Bernardino County sheriff had not yet asked for help from the Los Angeles force. Commander Smith would not say how many officers were at the airport because they did not want to ''tip their hand'' in case Mr. Dorner was watching.
The standoff came while officers investigated over 1,000 clues and tips about Mr. Dorner's whereabouts, past and present, Commander Smith said.
The standoff capped a week of sightings, shootings and false leads in the hunt for Mr. Dorner, who was dismissed from the Los Angeles Police Department in 2008 after investigators concluded that he had lied in his claim that a training officer had assaulted a homeless person.
In a 6,000-word manifesto that Mr. Dorner published on his Facebook page, he complained that he had been dismissed wrongfully. He cited racism and corruption in the department and threatened several police officials and their families.
Los Angeles police officers guarded 50 families around the clock, taking up a significant amount of department resources.
On Feb. 3, the police in Irvine, Calif., discovered the bodies of Monica Quan, 28, and her boyfriend, Keith Lawrence, 27, in their car in a parking garage near a condominium complex where they lived. Ms. Quan was the daughter of a retired Los Angeles police captain who played a role in the disciplinary process that led to Mr. Dorner's dismissal.
Last Wednesday at 10:30 p.m., the police believe, Mr. Dorner tried to hijack a boat at a marina in Point Loma, a community in San Diego. The man mentioned to the boat's captain that he intended to take the craft to Mexico. But the boat became disabled as he was trying to steal it, so he fled instead.
On Thursday at 1:45 a.m., two officers in a protection detail for one of the people threatened by name in the manifesto confronted a man they believe was Mr. Dorner near the person's home in Corona. Shots were exchanged, and one of the officers had a graze wound to his head. The gunman fled.
A short while later, two police officers in Riverside, Calif., were sitting in their patrol car at a stoplight when they were attacked by a man they believe was Mr. Dorner.
One of the officers was killed, the other injured. Again, the gunman fled.
At 5:20 the same morning, Los Angeles officers mistakenly shot and wounded two women delivering newspapers, thinking the pickup truck they were driving matched the description of the one Mr. Dorner was driving.
Late that afternoon, the police found the suspect's truck in the San Bernardino Mountains near Big Bear Lake. The hunt then focused on that area, which has only a handful of access roads.

The Rap On Rubio

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; OP-ED COLUMNIST; Pg. 27

LENGTH: 827 words

WASHINGTON
Not long ago, scrolling for a movie, I saw that ''Notorious'' was on.
How can you resist Cary Grant as an American spy in Rio recruiting Ingrid Bergman to seduce and betray a Nazi played by Claude Rains?
But it turned out to be a very different ''Notorious,'' one about the rise of gangsta rapper Biggie Smalls, a k a The Notorious B.I.G., his artistic relationship with Sean ''Puffy'' Combs at Bad Boy Records in New York and the bloody East vs. West feud between Biggie and Tupac Shakur, a star in L.A. who spent his final year at Death Row records. 
Like the 1946 ''Notorious,'' the 2009 gangsta rap saga offered sex, strife, danger, gats, Champagne, a strong immigrant mother and trust issues. Crack replaced uranium as the perilous substance. The movie climaxed with Tupac getting shot in a car on the Las Vegas Strip in 1996 and then, in retaliation six months later, Biggie getting shot in a car in L.A.
Little did I know, as I brushed up on gangsta rap history, that the topic would soon spice up the overture to the 2016 presidential race.
Gangsta rap used to be a reliable issue for politicians, but they were denouncing it. Now Senator Marco Rubio of Florida is praising it -- and right at the moment when Republicans are pushing the argument that guns don't kill people; it's a culture glorifying guns and violence that kills people.
The ubiquitous 41-year-old -- who's on the cover of Time as ''The Republican Savior'' -- looked as if he needed some saving himself Tuesday night as he delivered the party's response to the State of the Union address in English (and Spanish). He seemed parched, shaky and sweaty, rubbing his face and at one point lunging off-camera to grab a bottle of water. He needed some of the swagger reflected on the Spotify playlist he recently released, featuring Tupac's ''Changes,'' as well as Flo Rida, Pitbull, The Sugar Hill Gang, Kanye, Big Sean, devoted Obama supporters Jay-Z and Will.I.Am, and a Foster the People song about ''a cowboy kid'' who finds a gun in his dad's closet and goes after ''all the other kids with the pumped up kicks.''
Rubio told GQ that he loved the documentary on Tupac, ''Resurrection,'' and his song, ''Killuminati,'' and that 30-year-old hip-hop is now ''indistinguishable'' from pop. (Sorry, Tipper.)
He said that Tupac, who loved Shakespeare and called ''Romeo and Juliet'' ''serious ghetto,'' wrote poetry. Tupac's ''Changes'' lyric -- ''You see the old way wasn't working so it's on us to do what we gotta do to survive'' -- could be an anthem for the busted Republican Party.
Maybe Rubio is siding with West Coast rap in an early bid to nail down California's 55 electoral votes. But in The Atlantic Wire, Elspeth Reeve argues that, message-wise, it would make more sense for the ambitious G.O.P. senator to go with B.I.G., who had ''up-from-his-bootstraps small-business acumen'' and a mom who immigrated from Jamaica and ended up, as Biggie rapped, pimping an Acura with ''minks on her back.'' Tupac's mother and stepfather were Black Panthers.
Asked by BuzzFeed's Ben Smith about this recently, Rubio said that he was in school at the peak of Death Row music and preferred it.
He demurred when asked if he had learned any life lessons from Tupac -- ''I don't listen to music for the politics of it'' -- and noted that mostly, rappers were not ''condoning a certain lifestyle'' as much as reporting on ''what life was like in South Central.''
One-upping Paul Ryan and his heavy metal playlist, Rubio noted that the real name of Pitbull -- also born in Miami to Cuban parents -- is Armando and that Tupac has a lyric citing Bill Clinton and ''Mr. Bob Dole.''
In 1995, Dole railed that human dignity is demeaned when ''sexual violence is given a catchy tune.'' And, in 1992, Dan Quayle met with the daughter of a Texas state trooper who was fatally shot by a man who said he'd been listening to Tupac's ''2pacalypse Now,'' with lyrics about ''droppin' the cop;'' Quayle said such songs should not be published.
Rush Limbaugh mocked Tupac when he was shot in 1994 outside a New York studio where Biggie was recording; and he recently re-broadcast his 20-year-old rant about America losing its soul: ''Look at 2 Live Crew's 'Me So Horny.' You know what that's about? It's about the destruction of the female vagina by a bunch of men having a good time.'' (Sounds like a description of retrogressive Republicans in 2012; when the Violence Against Women Act passed the Senate on Tuesday, Rubio voted against it.)
But other Republicans are so frantic to make their party less white and more hip that Rubio's exegeses on gangsta rap are music to their ears.
Right now, Marco is like a paper doll, trying on different outfits of style and substance as the party oohs and aahs. As Nicolle Wallace, the former adviser to Sarah Palin, gushed to George Stephanopoulos: ''He's modern. He knows who Tupac is. He is on social media.'' And ''he's close to the younger Bushes.''
Who could ask for anything more?

Challenged for His Seat at 89, A Senator Does Not Go Gentle

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE and RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 1413 words

WASHINGTON -- As he approached his 89th birthday this year, Senator Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey was finally considering retirement, an option he had tried a decade earlier and hated so much that he jumped at the chance to return to political life.
Now he was the oldest member of the Senate. His family was urging him not to seek a sixth term. Polls were showing that voters might not give him one, and he had never liked fund-raising.
Then came Cory A. Booker, the 43-year-old mayor of Newark, whose 1.3 million followers on Twitter and robust presence on television had given him a reputation as a rising star in the Democratic Party, announcing that he would run for the Senate when Mr. Lautenberg's term is up. He made his declaration nearly two years before Election Day, and, notably, before Mr. Lautenberg, a fellow Democrat, had announced his own intentions.
If Mr. Booker was hoping to nudge Mr. Lautenberg toward the door, his announcement has had precisely the opposite effect. Mr. Lautenberg, a fighter dubbed ''swamp dog'' by a past opponent, has embraced his job with new vigor. He has taken a leading role on the issues of the day: fighting for recovery money for his hurricane-hit state and pushing for gun control after the shootings in Newtown, Conn. 
And he brightens at the prospect of tussling with a man half his age, even speaking openly to his staff about running again. He has jabbed at Mr. Booker, joking that he deserves a spanking for trying to unseat a fellow Democrat, and noting that the well-traveled mayor has no shortage of work to do in his own struggling city. ''I'm going to finish the work I'm doing,'' he said in an interview. ''And he should finish the work he is doing instead of traipsing around the country.''
Though most in his inner circle say they believe it is more likely that Mr. Lautenberg will ultimately decide to retire, some of those same people say he is convincing when he talks about the next campaign.
Mr. Booker's challenge has exposed a delicate discussion that senators and the protective cordon of aides around them rarely conduct in public: at what point does experience become more of a liability than an asset?
No one would accuse the United States Senate of age discrimination; stalwarts like Strom Thurmond and Robert C. Byrd affirmed a tradition that allows senators to go out on a stretcher if they choose. After an infusion of young blood in the last two years, the median age is 61. In the last several weeks, Jay Rockefeller (age 75), the five-term senator, announced he would retire, as did Tom Harkin (72) and Saxby Chambliss (69), all speaking of their desire to enjoy life beyond politics, mentioning their frustration with the paralysis afflicting Congress and only hinting at the difficulty they may have faced winning re-election. But Mr. Lautenberg, who has been around so long that his signature accomplishment is the law that banned smoking on airplanes, has never been one to go gently.
Raised poor in Paterson, N.J., where his father worked in the silk mills, Mr. Lautenberg made a fortune as the chief executive of Automatic Data Processing, the payroll company he helped found after graduating from Columbia on the G.I. Bill. In five terms in the Senate, he has earned a reputation as a fighter even by bare-knuckled New Jersey standards.
In 2000, he lashed out at the state's junior senator, Robert G. Torricelli, during a Democratic weekly caucus lunch, accusing him of encouraging the state's Republican governor to run for Mr. Lautenberg's seat. (Mr. Torricelli, in turn, threatened to castrate him.)
Mr. Lautenberg announced his retirement that year, saying he did not have the stomach for fund-raising. But he eagerly accepted two years later when he was asked to replace Mr. Torricelli, who was facing an ethics investigation, on the ballot.
He is not among the senators complaining about the institution being ''broken.'' He loves the work, and has taken on some of the most difficult battles -- with chemical companies, to maintain the Superfund program, with the National Rifle Association, to ban gun sales to people convicted of domestic violence and with the alcohol industry, to lower the legal blood-alcohol limit for driving to .08.
He is a night owl who enjoys the receptions of official Washington. He married his second wife when he was 80 and she was 56. He also successfully battled cancer two years ago.
Still, he had become increasingly convinced that it might be time to leave. Knowing that Mr. Booker was considering a run, two of the senator's aides approached the mayor in December and noted that the signs were pointing toward Mr. Lautenberg's retirement. During a visit and in several spirited phone calls to his office, the aides told the mayor he would not have to wait long, and urged him not to announce his intention until Mr. Lautenberg announced his own exit, saying it would be highly disrespectful to a sitting senator from his own party. When Mr. Booker made it clear he would announce, they asked that he say what other lawmakers interested in the seat have said: that he would run only if Mr. Lautenberg retired.
Mr. Booker did not do so when he announced his interest in running for the seat in December, then formed an exploratory committee and declared himself an official candidate in January. After Democrats in New Jersey and Washington criticized him, Mr. Booker acknowledged that he had not even spoken with Mr. Lautenberg.
For his part, Mr. Lautenberg insists he did not ''give a damn'' about any offense Mr. Booker might have caused. ''He doesn't have to respect me,'' Mr. Lautenberg said. ''But other people were offended by it. And it won me a lot of friends.''
And indeed, though Mr. Lautenberg has never enjoyed particular affection from his state's Democratic establishment, party leaders in New Jersey and Washington have rushed to his defense, publicly chastising Mr. Booker for trying to push out a fellow Democrat.
''We in the Democratic Party brought Senator Lautenberg out of retirement, and he's done more than help us out,'' said Loretta Weinberg, the majority leader in the New Jersey State Senate. ''He's a great senator. Cory Booker will make a great future leader, but I think a little sensitivity was called for.''
Charles E. Schumer of New York, the third ranking Democrat in the Senate, said Mr. Lautenberg should not be pushed into a premature decision to retire. ''In just the last couple months, he's been effective on two big fronts: passing Sandy aid and fighting for reasonable laws on gun safety,'' he said. ''Frank deserves the time and respect to make his own decisions.''
Some might say turnabout is fair play. In his first race, against Millicent H. Fenwick, Mr. Lautenberg reminded voters of his Republican opponent's 72 years by referring to her as ''eccentric'' and ''a national monument.''
A recent poll showed that most New Jersey voters approve of Mr. Lautenberg, but an even larger majority thinks his age makes another six-year term too difficult.
Mr. Lautenberg, however, remembers how ''awful'' he found retirement the last time. He left the Senate before the start of a recession, the Sept. 11 attacks and the start of the war in Afghanistan. ''I'm sitting on the sidelines like a spectator,'' he recalled. ''That wasn't the place I wanted to be.''
''There's a lot of work to be done,'' he said. ''So whether or not, 20 months from now, I'll be on the slate is not the primary issue.''
There was talk that he would announce his retirement at the annual New Jersey Chamber of Commerce dinner in Washington on Jan. 31, but that morning, he was talking to his staff about running again.
Speaking to the 900 people at the dinner, he tweaked Mayor Booker for not attending: ''I thought traveling out of the city was one of his favorite activities; perhaps we're too close to Newark.''
As a young staff member led him out of the ballroom, he headed toward a reception, where music was thumping. His wife, Bonnie, intercepted him. Mr. Lautenberg deferred to her, deflated, and headed toward the door.
He was stopped twice by constituents, then veered, like a salmon swimming upstream, toward the lobby bar. As he made his third attempt to leave, 20 minutes later, he was stopped again, by two teachers. As the conversation turned to Newtown, he thumped his cane. ''We have got to bring this country to its senses.''
He moved on. More people stopped him. It was close to midnight, and Frank Lautenberg was only halfway to the door.

Two Maryland Students Die in Murder-Suicide

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS; Christine Hauser contributed reporting.

LENGTH: 388 words

A University of Maryland graduate student shot his two roommates, one fatally, early Tuesday before killing himself outside the house they shared near the College Park campus, the authorities said. 
In addition to a handgun that the police say was used in the shootings, officers found a bag of weapons near the gunman's body -- including a loaded semiautomatic weapon that was not used in the attack, a machete and a baseball bat.
The police said that just before 1 a.m., the student, Dayvon Green, 23, set several small fires in the basement and the backyard of the house, which is about a block from campus.
When his roommates, both 22-year-old students, woke up, they persuaded Mr. Green to help them extinguish the fires, said Julie Parker, a spokeswoman for the Prince George's County Police Department.
The police said that as one of the roommates was going inside the house to get water, he saw Mr. Green reach inside his waistband and pull out a gun. The student told the authorities that he began to run but was struck by a bullet. He was still able to reach a neighbor's house.
The other roommate, however, identified by the police as Stephen Alex Rane, was shot several times and collapsed outside the house.
Moments later, Mr. Green walked to the back of the house and fatally shot himself, the police said.
The injured student, whose name has not yet been released, does not have life-threatening injuries, the authorities said.
Throughout the day on Tuesday, the university made walk-in emergency counseling available for students.
Wallace D. Loh, the university's president, said in a statement that ''the University of Maryland community awoke this morning to heartbreak,'' but added that ''together, we will emerge from our collective sadness.''
Mr. Green, a graduate engineering student, had previously attended Morgan State University in Baltimore.
As part of his undergraduate education, he had been a NASA student ambassador, a program run by the space agency that mentors talented college students studying science, engineering, technology or mathematics, according to the NASA Web site.
Mr. Green's research interest at the time, according to the site, was ''quality control and reliability studies, including the reliability of robotic satellite servicing missions for commercial and military communications spacecraft.''

Taking Guns to Holy Ground

BYLINE: By ELISABETH MALKIN

MEXICO CITY -- A young woman cradling a large crucifix left Mexico's holiest shrine, the Basilica of St. Mary of Guadalupe, on a recent afternoon and stopped at a tent outside, where soldiers were piling up pistols and rifles on a table, part of a citywide cash-for-guns program.
The woman had brought the crucifix to be blessed, but the sight of the tent reminded her father, who was with her, that he could finally get rid of the .22-caliber pistol and the .38-caliber revolver he kept at home.
''I have had them for 40 years, and I have never used them or will use them,'' said the 67-year-old man, who declined to give his name, citing the gun plan's anonymity. ''So I might as well exchange them.'' 
Mexico City officials have invited residents to drop off their antique pistols, rusted rifles, Saturday night specials, air guns, even their grenades -- no names, no questions -- hoping to put a dent in the number of weapons they believe are hidden in people's homes, avoid accidents and maybe even reduce violent crime.
They chose the basilica in the belief that people would feel more confident turning over their weapons on holy ground.
''It's neutral territory,'' said Rosa Icela Rodrםguez, the city's secretary of social development. People may not trust the police or the government, she said, but ''who doesn't know the basilica?''
The capital has largely been spared the gun violence that has ravaged much of the country. The city of nearly nine million had an average of slightly more than two killings a day last year, a rate lower than that of many large cities in the United States.
But in November, a 10-year-old boy at the movies was killed when a stray bullet fired into the air outside pierced the cinema's roof. The killing struck a nerve here, leading to calls for action.
City officials responded by shifting the desultory and poorly publicized efforts of the past into overdrive.
They are sending social workers door to door to remind residents that it is illegal to have a gun without a permit and that a gun at home does not guarantee protection. The workers have been spreading the word about the exchange and compiling an informal census on attitudes about guns. The buyback program, which began in December, has so far collected almost 3,500 guns, as well as ammunition and grenades.
Unlike the United States, where proposals for stricter gun laws are driving a heated political debate, Mexico has strict gun laws and little formal opposition to them. Mexico's Constitution guarantees the right to bear arms, but that right has been severely restricted.
It is virtually impossible to buy a gun legally; there is only one gun shop in the country, and it is run by the army. The kinds of guns people can buy are sharply limited and require a permit first. Private gun sales also require a permit, and carrying a gun outside one's home requires a separate document.
The Small Arms Survey, a research project at the Graduate Institute of Research and Development in Geneva, estimates that Mexico has 15.5 million civilian-owned guns, about 15 guns for every 100 residents, compared with 99 per 100 in the United States.
But the number of legal guns in Mexico is even lower: only 2.8 million are registered, according to the Organization of American States.
The vast majority of guns here come from the United States, either smuggled in by criminal gangs or diverted from legal purchases by corrupt officials, according to Magda Coss, who has written about Mexico's gun trade. Mexican leaders have blamed lax gun laws north of the border for the gun violence here, which the government says has taken about 50,000 lives in the past six years.
Long before the drug wars, Mexicans had an ambivalent relationship with guns. The history of insurrection and revolution created a popular mythology studded with armed folk heroes like Emiliano Zapata, the revolutionary depicted in a famous photograph with a rifle and bandoleers across his chest.
Village festivals to celebrate the patron saint often end with drunken men lumbering down starlit country roads shooting their weapons into the air. Mexico's fast-forward urbanization has simply moved the festivals and their shooting into densely populated working-class streets.
Ms. Rodrםguez, who personally lobbied the archbishop of Mexico City, Cardinal Norberto Rivera, to get the church involved, would like priests to discourage this holiday tradition publicly. She is organizing puppet shows and school talks to get the message to children. The buyback program, which she plans to continue all year, has since moved from the basilica to churches in other neighborhoods.
Experts say there is little evidence that voluntary gun buyback schemes, which have been popular in the United States, reduce gun violence. ''High-risk people don't tend to participate,'' said Jon Vernick, the co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research. ''You don't tend to get the high-risk guns. They tend to be older, lower caliber and not functional. Even the most successful buybacks aren't likely to take a substantial portion of the guns off the street.''
Mr. Vernick says, however, that such programs can help mobilize a community, and that is a goal of the Mexico City program.
Ms. Rodrםguez acknowledged that the program was not reaching the criminals most likely to use guns.
''What's important is communication,'' she said, ''that women make the men aware, that they tell them, 'Why do you have these weapons when you can get a computer for your children?' ''
Tucking ancient pistols into purses, and taping multiple plastic shopping bags around rifles, the city's residents have been climbing aboard buses and the subway in the hope of collecting as little as $20 for an airgun to as much as $500 for the occasional grenade launcher.
''My sons are grown, and it is a temptation to have it in the house,'' said Gabriel Garduסo Aceves, 48, an accountant, who got about $120 for a Smith & Wesson revolver.
Ana Vבzquez came with her 8-year-old son, Hיctor, to turn in a .38 Special revolver that belonged to her father. ''He likes weapons,'' she said, motioning to her son. As part of the scheme, children can also turn in toy guns in exchange for other toys, but Hיctor had refused.
One 38-year-old woman, who declined to give her name, handed over ammunition. Her father had left a collection of guns and ammunition when he died, and it had taken her years to get rid of it. ''Living with this is absurd and dangerous,'' she said.
Karina Camargo, 35, took her three children out of school for the day, wrapped up her husband's never-used hunting rifle and boarded the bus to bring it in. ''I need money,'' she said. ''I'll take whatever they give.''

Lutheran Leader Apologizes To Rebuked Newtown Pastor

In an unexpected reversal, the head of a conservative national Lutheran denomination has apologized after criticizing a pastor in Newtown, Conn., for taking part in an interfaith memorial service.
The Rev. Matthew C. Harrison, president of the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod, had sought, and received, an apology from the Newtown pastor, the Rev. Rob Morris, for violating the denomination's prohibition against joint worship with people of other faiths. But in the face of intense criticism, Mr. Harrison this week apologized himself. 
''I naןvely thought an apology for offense in the church would allow us to move quickly beyond internal controversy and toward a less emotional process of working through our differences, well out of the public spotlight,'' Mr. Harrison wrote on the church's Web site. ''That plan failed miserably.''
The Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod, which is smaller and more conservative than the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, bars joint worship because of a concern that such services could lend credence to faiths it views as false, or could suggest that differences between faiths are not important. It drew attention to itself by suspending a Brooklyn pastor, the Rev. David H. Benke, for taking part in an interfaith service after the Sept. 11, 2001, attack; Mr. Benke was later reinstated.
Mr. Harrison, in his pastoral letter, acknowledged tension within his denomination over the subject, saying it has ''struggled with this issue to the very breaking point.''
''One view is that by standing side-by-side with non-Christian clergy in public religious events, we give the impression that Christ is just one path among many,'' he wrote. ''Others view participation as an opportunity to share Christ and to truly love a hurting community, which may not happen if we are not participating. We struggle with the tension between these two views.''
In Newtown, the issue was particularly sensitive because a child in Mr. Morris's congregation had been killed in the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School on Dec. 14. Mr. Morris, serving in his first year as pastor of Christ the King Lutheran Church in Newtown, gave the benediction at a high-profile memorial service held on Dec. 16, which was attended by President Obama as well as representatives of many other religions.
Mr. Harrison said he took full ''responsibility for this debacle.''
''I handled it poorly, multiplying the challenges. I increased the pain of a hurting community,'' he wrote. ''I humbly offer my apologies to the congregation, Christ the King Lutheran Church, Newtown, Conn.; to Pastor Morris; and to the Newtown community.''

Obama's 2013 State of the Union Address

SECTION: Section ; Column 0; National Desk; TEXT; Pg. 

LENGTH: 6294 words

The following is the text as prepared for delivery of President Obama's State of the Union Address, as provided by the White House:
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, fellow citizens:
Fifty-one years ago, John F. Kennedy declared to this Chamber that ''the Constitution makes us not rivals for power but partners for progress...It is my task,'' he said, ''to report the State of the Union -- to improve it is the task of us all.''
Tonight, thanks to the grit and determination of the American people, there is much progress to report. After a decade of grinding war, our brave men and women in uniform are coming home. After years of grueling recession, our businesses have created over six million new jobs. We buy more American cars than we have in five years, and less foreign oil than we have in twenty. Our housing market is healing, our stock market is rebounding, and consumers, patients, and homeowners enjoy stronger protections than ever before.
Together, we have cleared away the rubble of crisis, and can say with renewed confidence that the state of our union is stronger. 
But we gather here knowing that there are millions of Americans whose hard work and dedication have not yet been rewarded. Our economy is adding jobs -- but too many people still can't find full-time employment. Corporate profits have rocketed to all-time highs -- but for more than a decade, wages and incomes have barely budged.
It is our generation's task, then, to reignite the true engine of America's economic growth -- a rising, thriving middle class.
It is our unfinished task to restore the basic bargain that built this country -- the idea that if you work hard and meet your responsibilities, you can get ahead, no matter where you come from, what you look like, or who you love.
It is our unfinished task to make sure that this government works on behalf of the many, and not just the few; that it encourages free enterprise, rewards individual initiative, and opens the doors of opportunity to every child across this great nation.
The American people don't expect government to solve every problem. They don't expect those of us in this chamber to agree on every issue. But they do expect us to put the nation's interests before party. They do expect us to forge reasonable compromise where we can. For they know that America moves forward only when we do so together; and that the responsibility of improving this union remains the task of us all.
Our work must begin by making some basic decisions about our budget -- decisions that will have a huge impact on the strength of our recovery.
Over the last few years, both parties have worked together to reduce the deficit by more than $2.5 trillion -- mostly through spending cuts, but also by raising tax rates on the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans. As a result, we are more than halfway towards the goal of $4 trillion in deficit reduction that economists say we need to stabilize our finances.
Now we need to finish the job. And the question is, how?
In 2011, Congress passed a law saying that if both parties couldn't agree on a plan to reach our deficit goal, about a trillion dollars' worth of budget cuts would automatically go into effect this year. These sudden, harsh, arbitrary cuts would jeopardize our military readiness. They'd devastate priorities like education, energy, and medical research. They would certainly slow our recovery, and cost us hundreds of thousands of jobs. That's why Democrats, Republicans, business leaders, and economists have already said that these cuts, known here in Washington as ''the sequester,'' are a really bad idea.
Now, some in this Congress have proposed preventing only the defense cuts by making even bigger cuts to things like education and job training; Medicare and Social Security benefits.
That idea is even worse. Yes, the biggest driver of our long-term debt is the rising cost of health care for an aging population. And those of us who care deeply about programs like Medicare must embrace the need for modest reforms -- otherwise, our retirement programs will crowd out the investments we need for our children, and jeopardize the promise of a secure retirement for future generations.
But we can't ask senior citizens and working families to shoulder the entire burden of deficit reduction while asking nothing more from the wealthiest and most powerful. We won't grow the middle class simply by shifting the cost of health care or college onto families that are already struggling, or by forcing communities to lay off more teachers, cops, and firefighters. Most Americans -- Democrats, Republicans, and Independents -- understand that we can't just cut our way to prosperity. They know that broad-based economic growth requires a balanced approach to deficit reduction, with spending cuts and revenue, and with everybody doing their fair share. And that's the approach I offer tonight.
On Medicare, I'm prepared to enact reforms that will achieve the same amount of health care savings by the beginning of the next decade as the reforms proposed by the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles commission. Already, the Affordable Care Act is helping to slow the growth of health care costs. The reforms I'm proposing go even further. We'll reduce taxpayer subsidies to prescription drug companies and ask more from the wealthiest seniors. We'll bring down costs by changing the way our government pays for Medicare, because our medical bills shouldn't be based on the number of tests ordered or days spent in the hospital -- they should be based on the quality of care that our seniors receive. And I am open to additional reforms from both parties, so long as they don't violate the guarantee of a secure retirement. Our government shouldn't make promises we cannot keep -- but we must keep the promises we've already made.
To hit the rest of our deficit reduction target, we should do what leaders in both parties have already suggested, and save hundreds of billions of dollars by getting rid of tax loopholes and deductions for the well-off and well-connected. After all, why would we choose to make deeper cuts to education and Medicare just to protect special interest tax breaks? How is that fair? How does that promote growth?
Now is our best chance for bipartisan, comprehensive tax reform that encourages job creation and helps bring down the deficit. The American people deserve a tax code that helps small businesses spend less time filling out complicated forms, and more time expanding and hiring; a tax code that ensures billionaires with high-powered accountants can't pay a lower rate than their hard-working secretaries; a tax code that lowers incentives to move jobs overseas, and lowers tax rates for businesses and manufacturers that create jobs right here in America. That's what tax reform can deliver. That's what we can do together.
I realize that tax reform and entitlement reform won't be easy. The politics will be hard for both sides. None of us will get 100 percent of what we want. But the alternative will cost us jobs, hurt our economy, and visit hardship on millions of hardworking Americans. So let's set party interests aside, and work to pass a budget that replaces reckless cuts with smart savings and wise investments in our future. And let's do it without the brinksmanship that stresses consumers and scares off investors. The greatest nation on Earth cannot keep conducting its business by drifting from one manufactured crisis to the next. Let's agree, right here, right now, to keep the people's government open, pay our bills on time, and always uphold the full faith and credit of the United States of America. The American people have worked too hard, for too long, rebuilding from one crisis to see their elected officials cause another.
Now, most of us agree that a plan to reduce the deficit must be part of our agenda. But let's be clear: deficit reduction alone is not an economic plan. A growing economy that creates good, middle-class jobs -- that must be the North Star that guides our efforts. Every day, we should ask ourselves three questions as a nation: How do we attract more jobs to our shores? How do we equip our people with the skills needed to do those jobs? And how do we make sure that hard work leads to a decent living?
A year and a half ago, I put forward an American Jobs Act that independent economists said would create more than one million new jobs. I thank the last Congress for passing some of that agenda, and I urge this Congress to pass the rest. Tonight, I'll lay out additional proposals that are fully paid for and fully consistent with the budget framework both parties agreed to just 18 months ago. Let me repeat -- nothing I'm proposing tonight should increase our deficit by a single dime. It's not a bigger government we need, but a smarter government that sets priorities and invests in broad-based growth.
Our first priority is making America a magnet for new jobs and manufacturing.
After shedding jobs for more than 10 years, our manufacturers have added about 500,000 jobs over the past three. Caterpillar is bringing jobs back from Japan. Ford is bringing jobs back from Mexico. After locating plants in other countries like China, Intel is opening its most advanced plant right here at home. And this year, Apple will start making Macs in America again.
There are things we can do, right now, to accelerate this trend. Last year, we created our first manufacturing innovation institute in Youngstown, Ohio. A once-shuttered warehouse is now a state-of-the art lab where new workers are mastering the 3D printing that has the potential to revolutionize the way we make almost everything. There's no reason this can't happen in other towns. So tonight, I'm announcing the launch of three more of these manufacturing hubs, where businesses will partner with the Departments of Defense and Energy to turn regions left behind by globalization into global centers of high-tech jobs. And I ask this Congress to help create a network of fifteen of these hubs and guarantee that the next revolution in manufacturing is Made in America.
If we want to make the best products, we also have to invest in the best ideas. Every dollar we invested to map the human genome returned $140 to our economy. Today, our scientists are mapping the human brain to unlock the answers to Alzheimer's; developing drugs to regenerate damaged organs; devising new material to make batteries ten times more powerful. Now is not the time to gut these job-creating investments in science and innovation. Now is the time to reach a level of research and development not seen since the height of the Space Race. And today, no area holds more promise than our investments in American energy.
After years of talking about it, we are finally poised to control our own energy future. We produce more oil at home than we have in 15 years. We have doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon of gas, and the amount of renewable energy we generate from sources like wind and solar -- with tens of thousands of good, American jobs to show for it. We produce more natural gas than ever before -- and nearly everyone's energy bill is lower because of it. And over the last four years, our emissions of the dangerous carbon pollution that threatens our planet have actually fallen.
But for the sake of our children and our future, we must do more to combat climate change. Yes, it's true that no single event makes a trend. But the fact is, the 12 hottest years on record have all come in the last 15. Heat waves, droughts, wildfires, and floods -- all are now more frequent and intense. We can choose to believe that Superstorm Sandy, and the most severe drought in decades, and the worst wildfires some states have ever seen were all just a freak coincidence. Or we can choose to believe in the overwhelming judgment of science -- and act before it's too late.
The good news is, we can make meaningful progress on this issue while driving strong economic growth. I urge this Congress to pursue a bipartisan, market-based solution to climate change, like the one John McCain and Joe Lieberman worked on together a few years ago. But if Congress won't act soon to protect future generations, I will. I will direct my Cabinet to come up with executive actions we can take, now and in the future, to reduce pollution, prepare our communities for the consequences of climate change, and speed the transition to more sustainable sources of energy.
Four years ago, other countries dominated the clean energy market and the jobs that came with it. We've begun to change that. Last year, wind energy added nearly half of all new power capacity in America. So let's generate even more. Solar energy gets cheaper by the year -- so let's drive costs down even further. As long as countries like China keep going all-in on clean energy, so must we.
In the meantime, the natural gas boom has led to cleaner power and greater energy independence. That's why my Administration will keep cutting red tape and speeding up new oil and gas permits. But I also want to work with this Congress to encourage the research and technology that helps natural gas burn even cleaner and protects our air and water.
Indeed, much of our new-found energy is drawn from lands and waters that we, the public, own together. So tonight, I propose we use some of our oil and gas revenues to fund an Energy Security Trust that will drive new research and technology to shift our cars and trucks off oil for good. If a non-partisan coalition of CEOs and retired generals and admirals can get behind this idea, then so can we. Let's take their advice and free our families and businesses from the painful spikes in gas prices we've put up with for far too long. I'm also issuing a new goal for America: let's cut in half the energy wasted by our homes and businesses over the next twenty years. The states with the best ideas to create jobs and lower energy bills by constructing more efficient buildings will receive federal support to help make it happen.
America's energy sector is just one part of an aging infrastructure badly in need of repair. Ask any CEO where they'd rather locate and hire: a country with deteriorating roads and bridges, or one with high-speed rail and internet; high-tech schools and self-healing power grids. The CEO of Siemens America -- a company that brought hundreds of new jobs to North Carolina -- has said that if we upgrade our infrastructure, they'll bring even more jobs. And I know that you want these job-creating projects in your districts. I've seen you all at the ribbon-cuttings.
Tonight, I propose a ''Fix-It-First'' program to put people to work as soon as possible on our most urgent repairs, like the nearly 70,000 structurally deficient bridges across the country. And to make sure taxpayers don't shoulder the whole burden, I'm also proposing a Partnership to Rebuild America that attracts private capital to upgrade what our businesses need most: modern ports to move our goods; modern pipelines to withstand a storm; modern schools worthy of our children. Let's prove that there is no better place to do business than the United States of America. And let's start right away.
Part of our rebuilding effort must also involve our housing sector. Today, our housing market is finally healing from the collapse of 2007. Home prices are rising at the fastest pace in six years, home purchases are up nearly 50 percent, and construction is expanding again.
But even with mortgage rates near a 50-year low, too many families with solid credit who want to buy a home are being rejected. Too many families who have never missed a payment and want to refinance are being told no. That's holding our entire economy back, and we need to fix it. Right now, there's a bill in this Congress that would give every responsible homeowner in America the chance to save $3,000 a year by refinancing at today's rates. Democrats and Republicans have supported it before. What are we waiting for? Take a vote, and send me that bill. Right now, overlapping regulations keep responsible young families from buying their first home. What's holding us back? Let's streamline the process, and help our economy grow.
These initiatives in manufacturing, energy, infrastructure, and housing will help entrepreneurs and small business owners expand and create new jobs. But none of it will matter unless we also equip our citizens with the skills and training to fill those jobs. And that has to start at the earliest possible age.
Study after study shows that the sooner a child begins learning, the better he or she does down the road. But today, fewer than 3 in 10 four year-olds are enrolled in a high-quality preschool program. Most middle-class parents can't afford a few hundred bucks a week for private preschool. And for poor kids who need help the most, this lack of access to preschool education can shadow them for the rest of their lives.
Tonight, I propose working with states to make high-quality preschool available to every child in America. Every dollar we invest in high-quality early education can save more than seven dollars later on -- by boosting graduation rates, reducing teen pregnancy, even reducing violent crime. In states that make it a priority to educate our youngest children, like Georgia or Oklahoma, studies show students grow up more likely to read and do math at grade level, graduate high school, hold a job, and form more stable families of their own. So let's do what works, and make sure none of our children start the race of life already behind. Let's give our kids that chance.
Let's also make sure that a high school diploma puts our kids on a path to a good job. Right now, countries like Germany focus on graduating their high school students with the equivalent of a technical degree from one of our community colleges, so that they're ready for a job. At schools like P-Tech in Brooklyn, a collaboration between New York Public Schools, the City University of New York, and IBM, students will graduate with a high school diploma and an associate degree in computers or engineering.
We need to give every American student opportunities like this. Four years ago, we started Race to the Top -- a competition that convinced almost every state to develop smarter curricula and higher standards, for about 1 percent of what we spend on education each year. Tonight, I'm announcing a new challenge to redesign America's high schools so they better equip graduates for the demands of a high-tech economy. We'll reward schools that develop new partnerships with colleges and employers, and create classes that focus on science, technology, engineering, and math -- the skills today's employers are looking for to fill jobs right now and in the future.
Now, even with better high schools, most young people will need some higher education. It's a simple fact: the more education you have, the more likely you are to have a job and work your way into the middle class. But today, skyrocketing costs price way too many young people out of a higher education, or saddle them with unsustainable debt.
Through tax credits, grants, and better loans, we have made college more affordable for millions of students and families over the last few years. But taxpayers cannot continue to subsidize the soaring cost of higher education. Colleges must do their part to keep costs down, and it's our job to make sure they do. Tonight, I ask Congress to change the Higher Education Act, so that affordability and value are included in determining which colleges receive certain types of federal aid. And tomorrow, my Administration will release a new ''College Scorecard'' that parents and students can use to compare schools based on a simple criteria: where you can get the most bang for your educational buck.
To grow our middle class, our citizens must have access to the education and training that today's jobs require. But we also have to make sure that America remains a place where everyone who's willing to work hard has the chance to get ahead.
Our economy is stronger when we harness the talents and ingenuity of striving, hopeful immigrants. And right now, leaders from the business, labor, law enforcement, and faith communities all agree that the time has come to pass comprehensive immigration reform.
Real reform means strong border security, and we can build on the progress my Administration has already made -- putting more boots on the southern border than at any time in our history, and reducing illegal crossings to their lowest levels in 40 years.
Real reform means establishing a responsible pathway to earned citizenship -- a path that includes passing a background check, paying taxes and a meaningful penalty, learning English, and going to the back of the line behind the folks trying to come here legally.
And real reform means fixing the legal immigration system to cut waiting periods, reduce bureaucracy, and attract the highly-skilled entrepreneurs and engineers that will help create jobs and grow our economy.
In other words, we know what needs to be done. As we speak, bipartisan groups in both chambers are working diligently to draft a bill, and I applaud their efforts. Now let's get this done. Send me a comprehensive immigration reform bill in the next few months, and I will sign it right away.
But we can't stop there. We know our economy is stronger when our wives, mothers, and daughters can live their lives free from discrimination in the workplace, and free from the fear of domestic violence. Today, the Senate passed the Violence Against Women Act that Joe Biden originally wrote almost 20 years ago. I urge the House to do the same. And I ask this Congress to declare that women should earn a living equal to their efforts, and finally pass the Paycheck Fairness Act this year.
We know our economy is stronger when we reward an honest day's work with honest wages. But today, a full-time worker making the minimum wage earns $14,500 a year. Even with the tax relief we've put in place, a family with two kids that earns the minimum wage still lives below the poverty line. That's wrong. That's why, since the last time this Congress raised the minimum wage, nineteen states have chosen to bump theirs even higher.
Tonight, let's declare that in the wealthiest nation on Earth, no one who works full-time should have to live in poverty, and raise the federal minimum wage to $9.00 an hour. This single step would raise the incomes of millions of working families. It could mean the difference between groceries or the food bank; rent or eviction; scraping by or finally getting ahead. For businesses across the country, it would mean customers with more money in their pockets. In fact, working folks shouldn't have to wait year after year for the minimum wage to go up while CEO pay has never been higher. So here's an idea that Governor Romney and I actually agreed on last year: let's tie the minimum wage to the cost of living, so that it finally becomes a wage you can live on.
Tonight, let's also recognize that there are communities in this country where no matter how hard you work, it's virtually impossible to get ahead. Factory towns decimated from years of plants packing up. Inescapable pockets of poverty, urban and rural, where young adults are still fighting for their first job. America is not a place where chance of birth or circumstance should decide our destiny. And that is why we need to build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class for all who are willing to climb them.
Let's offer incentives to companies that hire Americans who've got what it takes to fill that job opening, but have been out of work so long that no one will give them a chance. Let's put people back to work rebuilding vacant homes in run-down neighborhoods. And this year, my Administration will begin to partner with 20 of the hardest-hit towns in America to get these communities back on their feet. We'll work with local leaders to target resources at public safety, education, and housing. We'll give new tax credits to businesses that hire and invest. And we'll work to strengthen families by removing the financial deterrents to marriage for low-income couples, and doing more to encourage fatherhood -- because what makes you a man isn't the ability to conceive a child; it's having the courage to raise one.
Stronger families. Stronger communities. A stronger America. It is this kind of prosperity -- broad, shared, and built on a thriving middle class -- that has always been the source of our progress at home. It is also the foundation of our power and influence throughout the world.
Tonight, we stand united in saluting the troops and civilians who sacrifice every day to protect us. Because of them, we can say with confidence that America will complete its mission in Afghanistan, and achieve our objective of defeating the core of al Qaeda. Already, we have brought home 33,000 of our brave servicemen and women. This spring, our forces will move into a support role, while Afghan security forces take the lead. Tonight, I can announce that over the next year, another 34,000 American troops will come home from Afghanistan. This drawdown will continue. And by the end of next year, our war in Afghanistan will be over.
Beyond 2014, America's commitment to a unified and sovereign Afghanistan will endure, but the nature of our commitment will change. We are negotiating an agreement with the Afghan government that focuses on two missions: training and equipping Afghan forces so that the country does not again slip into chaos, and counter-terrorism efforts that allow us to pursue the remnants of al Qaeda and their affiliates.
Today, the organization that attacked us on 9/11 is a shadow of its former self. Different al Qaeda affiliates and extremist groups have emerged -- from the Arabian Peninsula to Africa. The threat these groups pose is evolving. But to meet this threat, we don't need to send tens of thousands of our sons and daughters abroad, or occupy other nations. Instead, we will need to help countries like Yemen, Libya, and Somalia provide for their own security, and help allies who take the fight to terrorists, as we have in Mali. And, where necessary, through a range of capabilities, we will continue to take direct action against those terrorists who pose the gravest threat to Americans.
As we do, we must enlist our values in the fight. That is why my Administration has worked tirelessly to forge a durable legal and policy framework to guide our counterterrorism operations. Throughout, we have kept Congress fully informed of our efforts. I recognize that in our democracy, no one should just take my word that we're doing things the right way. So, in the months ahead, I will continue to engage with Congress to ensure not only that our targeting, detention, and prosecution of terrorists remains consistent with our laws and system of checks and balances, but that our efforts are even more transparent to the American people and to the world.
Of course, our challenges don't end with al Qaeda. America will continue to lead the effort to prevent the spread of the world's most dangerous weapons. The regime in North Korea must know that they will only achieve security and prosperity by meeting their international obligations. Provocations of the sort we saw last night will only isolate them further, as we stand by our allies, strengthen our own missile defense, and lead the world in taking firm action in response to these threats.
Likewise, the leaders of Iran must recognize that now is the time for a diplomatic solution, because a coalition stands united in demanding that they meet their obligations, and we will do what is necessary to prevent them from getting a nuclear weapon. At the same time, we will engage Russia to seek further reductions in our nuclear arsenals, and continue leading the global effort to secure nuclear materials that could fall into the wrong hands -- because our ability to influence others depends on our willingness to lead.
America must also face the rapidly growing threat from cyber-attacks. We know hackers steal people's identities and infiltrate private e-mail. We know foreign countries and companies swipe our corporate secrets. Now our enemies are also seeking the ability to sabotage our power grid, our financial institutions, and our air traffic control systems. We cannot look back years from now and wonder why we did nothing in the face of real threats to our security and our economy.
That's why, earlier today, I signed a new executive order that will strengthen our cyber defenses by increasing information sharing, and developing standards to protect our national security, our jobs, and our privacy. Now, Congress must act as well, by passing legislation to give our government a greater capacity to secure our networks and deter attacks.
Even as we protect our people, we should remember that today's world presents not only dangers, but opportunities. To boost American exports, support American jobs, and level the playing field in the growing markets of Asia, we intend to complete negotiations on a Trans-Pacific Partnership. And tonight, I am announcing that we will launch talks on a comprehensive Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the European Union -- because trade that is free and fair across the Atlantic supports millions of good-paying American jobs.
We also know that progress in the most impoverished parts of our world enriches us all. In many places, people live on little more than a dollar a day. So the United States will join with our allies to eradicate such extreme poverty in the next two decades: by connecting more people to the global economy and empowering women; by giving our young and brightest minds new opportunities to serve and helping communities to feed, power, and educate themselves; by saving the world's children from preventable deaths; and by realizing the promise of an AIDS-free generation.
Above all, America must remain a beacon to all who seek freedom during this period of historic change. I saw the power of hope last year in Rangoon -- when Aung San Suu Kyi welcomed an American President into the home where she had been imprisoned for years; when thousands of Burmese lined the streets, waving American flags, including a man who said, ''There is justice and law in the United States. I want our country to be like that.''
In defense of freedom, we will remain the anchor of strong alliances from the Americas to Africa; from Europe to Asia. In the Middle East, we will stand with citizens as they demand their universal rights, and support stable transitions to democracy. The process will be messy, and we cannot presume to dictate the course of change in countries like Egypt; but we can -- and will -- insist on respect for the fundamental rights of all people. We will keep the pressure on a Syrian regime that has murdered its own people, and support opposition leaders that respect the rights of every Syrian. And we will stand steadfast with Israel in pursuit of security and a lasting peace. These are the messages I will deliver when I travel to the Middle East next month.
All this work depends on the courage and sacrifice of those who serve in dangerous places at great personal risk -- our diplomats, our intelligence officers, and the men and women of the United States Armed Forces. As long as I'm Commander-in-Chief, we will do whatever we must to protect those who serve their country abroad, and we will maintain the best military in the world. We will invest in new capabilities, even as we reduce waste and wartime spending. We will ensure equal treatment for all service members, and equal benefits for their families -- gay and straight. We will draw upon the courage and skills of our sisters and daughters, because women have proven under fire that they are ready for combat. We will keep faith with our veterans -- investing in world-class care, including mental health care, for our wounded warriors; supporting our military families; and giving our veterans the benefits, education, and job opportunities they have earned. And I want to thank my wife Michelle and Dr. Jill Biden for their continued dedication to serving our military families as well as they serve us.
But defending our freedom is not the job of our military alone. We must all do our part to make sure our God-given rights are protected here at home. That includes our most fundamental right as citizens: the right to vote. When any Americans -- no matter where they live or what their party -- are denied that right simply because they can't wait for five, six, seven hours just to cast their ballot, we are betraying our ideals. That's why, tonight, I'm announcing a non-partisan commission to improve the voting experience in America. And I'm asking two long-time experts in the field, who've recently served as the top attorneys for my campaign and for Governor Romney's campaign, to lead it. We can fix this, and we will. The American people demand it. And so does our democracy.
Of course, what I've said tonight matters little if we don't come together to protect our most precious resource -- our children.
It has been two months since Newtown. I know this is not the first time this country has debated how to reduce gun violence. But this time is different. Overwhelming majorities of Americans -- Americans who believe in the 2nd Amendment -- have come together around commonsense reform -- like background checks that will make it harder for criminals to get their hands on a gun. Senators of both parties are working together on tough new laws to prevent anyone from buying guns for resale to criminals. Police chiefs are asking our help to get weapons of war and massive ammunition magazines off our streets, because they are tired of being outgunned.
Each of these proposals deserves a vote in Congress. If you want to vote no, that's your choice. But these proposals deserve a vote. Because in the two months since Newtown, more than a thousand birthdays, graduations, and anniversaries have been stolen from our lives by a bullet from a gun.
One of those we lost was a young girl named Hadiya Pendleton. She was 15 years old. She loved Fig Newtons and lip gloss. She was a majorette. She was so good to her friends, they all thought they were her best friend. Just three weeks ago, she was here, in Washington, with her classmates, performing for her country at my inauguration. And a week later, she was shot and killed in a Chicago park after school, just a mile away from my house.
Hadiya's parents, Nate and Cleo, are in this chamber tonight, along with more than two dozen Americans whose lives have been torn apart by gun violence. They deserve a vote.
Gabby Giffords deserves a vote.
The families of Newtown deserve a vote.
The families of Aurora deserve a vote.
The families of Oak Creek, and Tucson, and Blacksburg, and the countless other communities ripped open by gun violence -- they deserve a simple vote.
Our actions will not prevent every senseless act of violence in this country. Indeed, no laws, no initiatives, no administrative acts will perfectly solve all the challenges I've outlined tonight. But we were never sent here to be perfect. We were sent here to make what difference we can, to secure this nation, expand opportunity, and uphold our ideals through the hard, often frustrating, but absolutely necessary work of self-government.
We were sent here to look out for our fellow Americans the same way they look out for one another, every single day, usually without fanfare, all across this country. We should follow their example.
We should follow the example of a New York City nurse named Menchu Sanchez. When Hurricane Sandy plunged her hospital into darkness, her thoughts were not with how her own home was faring -- they were with the twenty precious newborns in her care and the rescue plan she devised that kept them all safe.
We should follow the example of a North Miami woman named Desiline Victor. When she arrived at her polling place, she was told the wait to vote might be six hours. And as time ticked by, her concern was not with her tired body or aching feet, but whether folks like her would get to have their say. Hour after hour, a throng of people stayed in line in support of her. Because Desiline is 102 years old. And they erupted in cheers when she finally put on a sticker that read ''I Voted.''
We should follow the example of a police officer named Brian Murphy. When a gunman opened fire on a Sikh temple in Wisconsin, and Brian was the first to arrive, he did not consider his own safety. He fought back until help arrived, and ordered his fellow officers to protect the safety of the Americans worshiping inside -- even as he lay bleeding from twelve bullet wounds.
When asked how he did that, Brian said, ''That's just the way we're made.''
That's just the way we're made.
We may do different jobs, and wear different uniforms, and hold different views than the person beside us. But as Americans, we all share the same proud title:
We are citizens. It's a word that doesn't just describe our nationality or legal status. It describes the way we're made. It describes what we believe. It captures the enduring idea that this country only works when we accept certain obligations to one another and to future generations; that our rights are wrapped up in the rights of others; and that well into our third century as a nation, it remains the task of us all, as citizens of these United States, to be the authors of the next great chapter in our American story.
Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.

G.O.P. Puts On a Calmer Face, Except for One Wild-Eyed Rocker

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN; Ashley Parker and Jeremy Peters contributed reporting.

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 19

LENGTH: 1033 words

WASHINGTON -- In the wake of their electoral drubbing in November, Republicans sought an image reboot at President Obama's State of the Union address, a new face that would be both more positive and less strident, youthful and multicultural but also quietly constructive and respectful.
Then there was Ted Nugent, the 64-year-old rocker who once told the president to ''suck on my machine gun.'' 
Mr. Nugent, the gun-rights brawler, sat stone-faced high up in the House spectators' gallery as the president pressed an agenda that went far beyond gun control. Invited to watch as the guest of another firebrand, Steve Stockman, a Republican representative from Texas, his crossed arms and stern visage seemed to capture the conflict still lurking within the Republican Party as its leaders look to expand their appeal.
There were no shouts of ''you lie!'' Tuesday night, no overt moments of disrespect beyond the usual partisan responses to policy. But in a House chamber filled conspicuously with the victims of gun violence and family members still grieving for lost loved ones, Mr. Nugent seemed like a provocation, a saber-toothed tiger invited to a garden party.
''I tend not to engage in inflammatory displays like that,'' said Representative Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, a Republican moderate who invited a young constituent he had nominated for the United States Naval Academy.
Such dissonant notes reverberated throughout the marble halls of the Capitol all day Tuesday, from the office suite of the House speaker to the floor of the Senate to a rancorous roll call for Chuck Hagel at the usually decorous Senate Armed Services Committee. It reflected the very real struggle within the party between Republicans who believe tangible adjustments are needed, in policy and tone, and an equally confident core that maintains the party's problem is that it has not been conservative enough.
''He'll continue this demagoguery,'' Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, said of the president after the speech. ''He'll still waste everybody's time on gun control -- it's not going to pass -- and distract Americans from what we really need to do.''
Senator Marco Rubio of Florida gave the official Republican response, taking the unprecedented step for the party of speaking in English and in Spanish to reach out to Latino voters who forsook the party in November.
''Despite our differences, I know that both Republicans and Democrats love America,'' he said, in an address that spoke passionately of his own immigrant background and economic rise. ''I pray we can come together to solve our problems, because the choices before us could not be more important.''
The lasting image of Mr. Rubio's address may not have been his youthful face and stately backdrop but an odd lurch off camera mid-speech for a quick drink of water. He recovered from the glitch, but it marred an otherwise smooth performance.
But before Mr. Rubio spoke from the well-appointed Capitol cloisters of House Speaker John A. Boehner, the speaker grabbed attention when he told reporters that he would like ''a little foreplay first'' from the president before embracing a path to citizenship for undocumented workers in an immigration bill.
Fellow Republican senators hailed Mr. Rubio, their new spokesman and a 2016 presidential hopeful, in terms that spoke to broader hopes for the party: youth, vitality, thoughtfulness and an affirmative agenda that was not just oppositional.
''Obviously, we know we've got to be for things,'' said Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona. Still, Mr. Rubio voted Tuesday against reauthorizing a more muscular Violence Against Women Act, an echo of his own roots on the right flank of his party. He was one of only 22 senators to oppose the bill, which 23 Republicans and 55 Democrats endorsed.
The Republicans sent out another mixed message earlier in the day when Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, the House Republican Conference chairwoman, launched the party's first official Spanish-language Twitter account, @GOPespanol. But last week, when House Republicans tried to begin a broader ''G.O.P. en Espaסol'' program, which was to distribute Republican reactions to the State of the Union in Spanish, the most vociferous anti-illegal immigration voices in the House objected.
''There's a conflicting message that comes out from the Republicans if we want to recognize the unifying power of English, and meanwhile, we send out communications in multiple languages,'' Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa, told National Journal. Official business and documents, he said, need to be in English.
The Tea Party's response to the State of the Union address fell to Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, no shrinking violet but a softer voice than last year's respondent, Herman Cain, or the inaugural choice in 2011, Representative Michele Bachmann, who looked away from the camera as she denounced the ''16,500 I.R.S. agents in charge of policing President Obama's health care bill'' and hailed ''the early days of a history-making turn'' in American governance.
Meanwhile, in the Senate Armed Services Committee -- a panel that for decades has been run with bipartisan decorum -- Senator Ted Cruz, a freshman Republican from Texas, all but called President Obama's nominee for defense secretary, Mr. Hagel, an extremist with ties to shady organizations.
''I will point out that right now this committee knows absolutely nothing about the personal compensation Chuck Hagel received in 2008 and 2009 or 2010,'' Mr. Cruz said. ''We do not know, for example, if he received compensation for giving paid speeches at extreme or radical groups.''
That yielded a stinging rebuke from the usually soft-spoken Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, who said Mr. Cruz, a Tea Party favorite, had gone ''over the line'' and ''impugned the patriotism of the nominee.''
Republicans still held out hope that the lasting image of the night would not be such backbiting but a new tone of cooperation. ''Good people will show that we're a governing party,'' said Senator Mike Johanns, a Nebraska Republican. ''You win elections because people believe you can make a difference.''

Obama Vows Push to Life Economy for Middle Class

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 1310 words

WASHINGTON -- President Obama, seeking to put the prosperity and promise of the middle class at the heart of his second-term agenda, called on Congress on Tuesday night to raise the federal minimum wage to $9 an hour, saying that would lift millions out of poverty and energize the economy.
In an assertive State of the Union address that fleshed out the populist themes of his inauguration speech, Mr. Obama declared it was ''our generation's task'' to ''reignite the true engine of America's economic growth -- a rising, thriving middle class.''
''Every day,'' he said, ''we should ask ourselves three questions as a nation: How do we attract more jobs to our shores? How do we equip our people with the skills to get those jobs? And how do we make sure that hard work leads to a decent living?'' 
The increase in the minimum wage, from $7.25 an hour now, was the most tangible of a raft of initiatives laid out by the president, from education and energy to public works projects. Taken together, Mr. Obama said, these investments would accelerate the nation's recovery by helping those in the broad middle class.
Raising the minimum wage holds particular political appeal for younger Americans, struggling workers and labor groups, all of which were important to Mr. Obama's re-election. His proposal drew one of the loudest ovations of the evening from Democrats in the House chamber.
Speaking to a divided Congress, with many Republicans still smarting from his November victory, Mr. Obama declared, ''Together, we have cleared away the rubble of crisis, and we can say with renewed confidence that the state of our union is stronger.''
He urged lawmakers to act on immigration, climate change, budget negotiations, and, above all, on gun violence, delivering an emotional appeal for stricter controls that drew on recent tragedies like the schoolhouse massacre in Newtown, Conn.
''They deserve a vote,'' Mr. Obama declared over and over, gesturing to victims of various shootings, who were scattered through the audience.
Mr. Obama took the podium after a rousing welcome from lawmakers and other dignitaries. But millions of TV viewers, not to mention people glancing at their smartphones inside the chamber, were distracted by a manhunt across the country, where the police in California were tracking a suspect in the killing of officers and others.
News coverage concentrated on the search almost up to the point the president entered the chamber, and immediately after he finished, networks cut away to continue reporting on the events in California.
Republicans quickly rejected Mr. Obama's activist approach, saying it would inevitably translate into higher taxes and an overweening government role, strangling economic growth and deepening the nation's fiscal hole.
Still, in selecting Senator Marco Rubio, a Cuban-American from Florida, to deliver their party's official rebuttal, Republicans implicitly acknowledged the damage they had suffered at the polls from their hard line stance on immigration. Mr. Rubio, one of the party's rising stars, favors overhauling immigration laws.
On Tuesday, he complained that Mr. Obama's ''solution to virtually every problem we face is for Washington to tax more, borrow more, and spend more.''
In a speech dominated by domestic issues, Mr. Obama admonished North Korea a day after it tested a nuclear weapon. He warned the country's reclusive government that it faced further isolation, swift retaliation and a United States bent on improving its own missile defense systems.
As new threats erupted, however, old threats were receding, Mr. Obama said. He announced, for example, that 34,000 troops would return home from Afghanistan by this time next year. That withdrawal, representing slightly more than half the current American force, underlined his resolve to quickly wind down the second war of his presidency.
Mr. Obama did not match the lofty tone of his inauguration speech, but the address was clearly intended to be its workmanlike companion. In place of his ringing call for a more equitable society was a package of proposals that constitute a blueprint for the remainder of his presidency. Some would require legislation; others merely an executive order.
Among the proposals was a $1 billion investment to create 15 institutes to develop new manufacturing technologies, building on the success of a pilot project in Youngstown, Ohio. He said he would use oil and gas royalties from federal lands to pay for research in clean energy technology that would wean cars and trucks off oil.
Mr. Obama pledged to work with states to provide high-quality preschool to every child in America. And he recycled a proposal to help homeowners refinance their mortgages.
None of these proposals, Mr. Obama said, would add to the deficit, since they were consistent with the budget deal of 18 months ago. ''It's not a bigger government we need,'' he said, ''but a smarter government that sets priorities and invests in broad-based growth.''
Mr. Obama also signaled, however, that the era of single-minded deficit-cutting should end. He noted that the recent agreements on taxes and spending reduced the deficit by $2.5 trillion, more than halfway toward the $4 trillion in reductions that economists say would put the nation's finances on a sustainable course.
Mr. Obama spoke darkly of the consequences of a failure to reach a budget deal, which would set off automatic spending cuts on the military and other programs. ''These sudden, harsh, arbitrary cuts would jeopardize our military readiness,'' he said.
On climate change, Mr. Obama endorsed the cap-and-trade legislation once championed by Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and former Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, but long stalled in Congress. Though the president said he would not hesitate to use executive orders to push his own measures to reduce carbon emissions, he did not give any details.
In another sign of the election's lingering shadow, Mr. Obama was creating a bipartisan commission to investigate voting irregularities that led to long lines at polling sites in November. Studies indicate that these lines cost Democrats hundreds of thousands of votes. The commission will be led by the chief counsel of the Obama presidential campaign, Robert Bauer, and a legal adviser to Mitt Romney's campaign, Ben Ginsberg.
On trade policy, the president said that the United States and the European Union were ready to begin negotiations on a comprehensive trade treaty. That came after a report submitted earlier in the day concluded that the gaps between the two sides were narrow enough to put a deal within reach.
The most impassioned parts of the speech echoed those that Mr. Obama delivered on the west front of the Capitol three weeks ago.
''It is our unfinished task to restore the basic bargain that built this country,'' he said. ''The idea that if you work hard and meet your responsibilities, you can get ahead, no matter where you come from, what you look like, or who you love.''
''It is our unfinished task to make sure that this government works on behalf of the many, and not just the few,'' he continued. ''That it encourages free enterprise, rewards individual initiative and opens the doors of opportunity to every child across this great nation of ours.''
Children loomed large on Tuesday night. In addition to a teacher from Sandy Hook Elementary School, the guests included the parents of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old high school student whose shooting death in Chicago has become an emblem of the grim toll of gun violence.
''She was 15 years old,'' Mr. Obama said of Ms. Pendleton, in words that briefly transcended the political bromides and policy prescriptions of these speeches. ''She loved Fig Newtons and lip gloss. She was a majorette. She was so good to her friends, they all thought they were her best friend.''

 The Fate of Presidents' State of the Union Wishes: Of the legislative requests that presidents have made during the State of the Union address since 1965, just  under half were at least partly successful, according to the political scientists Donna R. Hoffman and Alison  D. Howard. They measured whether a president achieved his request, achieved some version of it or did not  achieve it. President Obama achieved just over half of the requests he made during his first two addresses,  but has seen his success rate decline since Republicans took control of the House in 2011.

Syrian Rebels Say They Have Seized a Military Airfield and Its Warplanes

BYLINE: By HWAIDA SAAD and RICK GLADSTONE; Hwaida Saad reported from Beirut, and Rick Gladstone from New York. Hania Mourtada and Anne Barnard contributed reporting from Beirut.

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 6

LENGTH: 882 words

BEIRUT, Lebanon -- Syrian insurgents seized control of a northern military airfield on Tuesday and captured usable warplanes for the first time in the nearly two-year-old conflict, according to rebels and activist groups. The development, if confirmed, would represent the second strategic setback for President Bashar al-Assad's government this week.
The reported seizure of Al Jarrah airfield in Aleppo Province, which was corroborated by rebel video clips uploaded on the Internet, came a day after insurgent fighters announced that they had taken control of Syria's largest hydroelectric dam, which supplies power to areas held by Mr. Assad's security forces and by the insurgent Free Syrian Army and affiliated rebel groups. Whoever controls that dam, situated on the Euphrates River in northeast Raqqa Province, theoretically has the ability to deny electricity to significant areas held by the other side. 
It was far from clear whether the insurgency's claimed military gains signaled a bigger turn in the conflict, but some political analysts said they believed that the claims were credible and noteworthy. ''Combined with capturing the dam, it's another sign that Assad's power is degrading but not yet finished,'' said Andrew J. Tabler, a senior fellow in the Program on Arab Politics at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.
There were unconfirmed reports late Tuesday of a mass defection by 40 members of Syria's Fourth Armored Division and the Republican Guard, two of the best-trained and most loyal elements of Mr. Assad's military, drawn largely from his Alawite minority that runs the country and is responsible for protecting him.
The Local Coordination Committees, an anti-Assad activist group, publicized a video posted on YouTube by the supposed defectors, 15 of whom joined the Free Syrian Army. If confirmed, the defection suggested that the inner core of Mr. Assad's security apparatus may be starting to corrode.
The developments coincided with a sharply higher estimate of total casualties in the conflict -- nearly 70,000 -- from the top human rights official at the United Nations, Navi Pillay, in a report to the Security Council, which has been deadlocked on how to deal with Syria. Less than two months ago, Ms. Pillay said more than 60,000 had died in Syria since the uprising against Mr. Assad began in March 2011.
She exhorted the Security Council to take action, saying, ''We will be judged against the tragedy that has unfolded before our eyes.''
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an anti-Assad group based in Britain with a network of contacts inside Syria, said the Syrian Air Force had responded to the Jarrah seizure by bombarding it, presumably to destroy or incapacitate the planes there. The group said in a Facebook post that the rebels had ''taken control of tens of military jets,'' mostly Soviet-era MIG-17s and Sukhoi L-39 jet fighters. ''This is considered the first instance of rebels acquiring fighter jets,'' the group said.
More than 40 Syrian soldiers were captured by the rebels, with an unspecified number of others killed and wounded, the group said, and the rebels confiscated ammunition and machine guns.
The triumphal video clips posted on YouTube by the Jarrah attackers included one showing rebels inside the facility, with a background voice yelling: ''Allahu akbar, our spoils are planes! You pigs of Bashar!''
Another video shows a line of jet fighters parked in the open near a runway, most apparently intact but at least one crumpled.
By late Tuesday it was unclear if any planes of the Jarrah-based fleet had suffered damage, either in the two-day siege by the insurgents to capture the airfield, or in the Syrian Air Force's response. Syria's official SANA news agency, in its daily report on insurgent fighting, said the army had inflicted ''heavy losses upon terrorists in several provinces,'' but said nothing about the Jarrah airfield.
Earlier instances of rebel seizures of military airfields have been met with ferocious reprisal bombings by Mr. Assad's military, which would rather destroy the planes and other weaponry than lose them to the rebels.
Syrian forces also have fired Scud missiles at suspected insurgent positions, according to opposition activists and Western intelligence officials. But the Scuds, not known for their precision, have hit civilians as well. The Local Coordination Committees, a network of anti-Assad groups, reported on Tuesday that three Scuds had landed in Barouda, a small village in Raqqa Province, destroying at least one house.
The addition of aircraft to the rebel arsenal is a potentially significant military development if any of the pilots who have defected to the insurgency are capable of flying them. Until now, Mr. Assad has been able to contain or repel insurgent gains in many parts of the country because of his side's overwhelming air power.
But even if rebel pilots can start fighting the Syrian Air Force in the sky, they remain heavily outgunned, a reality that some fighters acknowledged on Tuesday in Skype interviews after news of the Jarrah airfield capture.
''It is very hard to use these warplanes because the regime has radars and long-distance rockets, unless it is a suicidal attack,'' said the fighter, who identified himself only by his first name, Saado.

NI NO KUNI
Wrath of the White Witch
Released on Jan. 22
Developed by Level-5 and Studio Ghibli
Published by Namco Bandai
For PlayStation 3
Rated Everyone 10+ (generally suitable for ages 10 and older); alcohol and tobacco references, fantasy violence, mild language and simulated gambling
The result of a collaboration between the animation house Studio Ghibli and the developers at Level-5, Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch is a stellar mash-up of both companies' strengths, mixing Ghibli's eye-popping style with Level-5's turn-based substance. Ni no Kuni blends three-dimensional character models and watercolors in a way that makes the whole world pop, from crusty stone tablets to flying purple dragons. It looks and feels like an interactive cartoon. 
While this gorgeous game follows the traditional formula made popular by Japanese role-playing games like Final Fantasy, in which you fight your way through menacing dungeons and buy equipment in friendly towns, Ni no Kuni shines because it pays attention to the details: the way the cloak of the main character, Oliver, sways and shimmies in the wind; the way his partner, Drippy, dances as you wander through the world; the way every nook and cranny feel as if they had been made with care and precision.
From the 200-page ''Wizard's Companion,'' an in-game book filled with spells and short stories, to the Pokיmon-like system for collecting and growing monsters, Ni no Kuni is full of activities and adventure. It's a whimsical, charming, aggressively colorful treat.
TEMPLE RUN 2
Released on Jan. 17 and Jan. 24
Developed and published by Imangi Studios
For iOS and Android
Rated 9+ for mild cartoon or fantasy violence
The original Temple Run is one of mobile gaming's sweetest success stories. Created by the married team of Keith Shepherd and Natalia Luckyanova, the game has been downloaded more than 170 million times since its 2011 release. Having ''recovered'' a valuable artifact from an ancient temple, an Indiana Jones kind of guy, who is pursued by angry guardians, moves forward automatically as the player swipes and tilts the screen to collect coins and avoid obstacles.
There is no finish line; the goal is to run as far as you can. This simple ''endless running'' mechanic made Temple Run the perfect game for mobile phones, and Imangi Studios hasn't strayed from that basic formula with Temple Run 2.
The scenery has changed from the jungle to the mountains; angular paths have been replaced with rolling hills and crumbling, vertigo-inducing sky bridges. Thrilling mine-cart and zip-line rides have been added, granting players brief respite from beating feet.
The biggest additions to Temple Run 2 are elements borrowed from the flood of endless runner games that followed in the original's wake. Rotating goals and coin-fueled upgradable powers make it easier than ever to grab for the golden idol and take flight over and over again.
THE CAVE
Released on Jan. 22
Developed by Double Fine
Published by Sega
For Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii U, PC, Mac and Linux
Rated T for Teen for fantasy, violence and blood
Most games follow the journey of a hero. Wrongs are righted, and bad guys are killed. But the action and puzzle game the Cave lets you choose to play as any three selected from seven of the most selfish, greedy, treacherous characters video game protagonists ever offered. They sacrifice their companions for their own gains. They lie, cheat and steal, all as you direct them to do so. You use the three characters to solve all sorts of environmental puzzles, usually with a stick of dynamite in hand to blast a hole through a wall for safe passage.
It's a witty and charming game, even with all the back-and-forth walking you'll have to do to solve each puzzle. It helps to play cooperatively with a friend, to minimize the frustrations of backtracking and to escape from a particularly complex situation. The puzzles almost feel like mysteries waiting to be unraveled, with you as a detective sniffing out each level for clues. Solving each one is a triumphant relief. While the pacing could be better, the message is lasting and worth the annoyance.
DEAD SPACE 3
Released on Feb. 5
Developed by Visceral Games
Published by EA
For Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and PC
Rated M for Mature for an alcohol reference, fantasy violence and mildly suggestive themes
Dead Space is a survival-horror, third-person shooter series known most prominently for the buglike Necromorph enemies, whose limbs you have to shoot clean off to kill. But horror manifests itself in other fascinating ways in this fictional, futuristic universe: an overzealous religious group founded on the insane theory that the Markers that birth these Necromorphs have something good to offer humanity, or powerful hallucinations that send the protagonist, Isaac, into a craze.
The third game in the series takes a new direction. It is scaled to be an easier, more action-packed experience.
Gone are the dark, narrow corridors you fight in. Also gone are the numerous trippy hallucinations. They're replaced by a lengthier campaign.
The game is best played in the co-op mode with a friend; this way, more personality is seen through the eyes of Isaac's companion, Carver. Most of Dead Space 3 is missing the depth and intrigue that the series is known for.
If you forget for a moment that these games used to be delightfully terrifying experiences, you can perhaps enjoy the new one as a two-player game with some solid combat and distinctive weapons that you build yourself.
FIRE EMBLEM
Awakening
Released on Feb. 4
Developed by Intelligent Systems
Published by Nintendo
For Nintendo 3DS
Rated T for Teen for an alcohol reference, fantasy violence, mild language and mildly suggestive themes
Imagine that any pawn you lost in a chess game were lost forever. The next time you played, you'd have one fewer. This would be sad -- sadder if that pawn had a name and was, under your direction, being carefully, magically brought along to be a super-pawn (with claws, or something). This is how Fire Emblem games have long worked, merging some basic sword-and-sorcery tales into a system of magical chess that makes its pieces feel alive.
One of the great traits was that Fire Emblem made players feel the sting of their pawns' deaths. It was hard, if not impossible, to restore those pawns to life. What the older versions did for death, the new game (subtitled Awakening) does for relationships. Characters who fight near one another can become friends, fall in love and marry. To continue the chess metaphor, the knight can fall in love with the rook, and that couple will fight all the more effectively because of it.
The core of Fire Emblem, the dark-fantasy persistent version of chess, is still captivating. But that concept, when extended to a game that lets its chess pieces marry, results in something surprising: an adventure in which it matters not only who lives but also with whom they spend that life.

The President's Challenge to Congress

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; EDITORIAL; Pg. 26

LENGTH: 686 words

Americans who have become weary of Washington's endless battles over spending and taxes -- and the stagnating economy that stalemate has produced -- got a chance to hear about a different path on Tuesday night. President Obama's message in the State of the Union address was clear: It doesn't have to be this way.
The country doesn't have to get bogged down by demands for endless austerity and government contraction. It doesn't have to defer investments in education and public works. The poor don't have to remain on society's lower rungs, and the middle class can aspire to do better. Mr. Obama said his proposals to bring about growth with government action would not have to raise the deficit. 
What is required to move the country forward is political will, which has been missing for too long. While many of the president's proposals were familiar, and will probably be snuffed out by politics, his speech explained to a wide audience what could be achieved if there were even a minimal consensus in Washington.
Mr. Obama called for a series of steps that would provide enormous benefit for the middle class and for those hoping to enter it: universal public preschool in every state, a tax code that encourages manufacturing, a higher minimum wage and vital repairs to infrastructure. These and other investments could be paid for by ending tax loopholes for corporations and the wealthy, the kind of tax reform that Republicans have already said they support. The effect on jobs and incomes would be significant.
''Most Americans -- Democrats, Republicans and independents -- understand that we can't just cut our way to prosperity,'' he said. ''They know that broad-based economic growth requires a balanced approach to deficit reduction, with spending cuts and revenue.''
Repairing the economy was only one of the challenges the president set before Congress. If lawmakers could overcome ideology and extreme partisanship, they could make real progress on things that most Americans say they want, including immigration and an improved voting system. In the most emotional moment of the night, drawing sustained cheers, he said victims of gun violence deserve a vote on each of his gun control proposals, from background checks to a ban on assault weapons.
But on virtually every one of these issues, Republicans are standing in the way. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, the Republicans' designated responder, wielded the party's ancient clichי that the president simply wanted more ''big government.''
In fact, according to the president, spending is going down, thanks to $1.4 trillion in cuts already enacted. That makes investing in programs like universal preschool more affordable. By educating children at a critical juncture in their lives, such a program could help reduce dropout rates later. The Center for American Progress estimates a similar idea would cost $200 billion over 10 years, but no investment would be more important.
''Every dollar we invest in high-quality early childhood education can save more than $7 later on,'' he said, ''by boosting graduation rates, reducing teen pregnancy, even reducing violent crime.''
Raising the minimum wage to $9 from $7.25, and indexing it to the cost of living, would lift many families out of poverty, though it was not clear why Mr. Obama backed down from his 2008 proposal for a $9.50 wage.
Mr. Obama laid out a timetable for withdrawing 34,000 American troops from Afghanistan by this time next year; we would have preferred that all 68,000 troops be pulled out. He also made an intriguing promise of greater transparency in targeting enemy combatants, which will require clarification in the days to come.
He failed to propose a strong legislative agenda to eliminate long lines at the polls, instead announcing a bipartisan commission to recommend changes, even though good bills to improve registration and early voting have already been introduced.
Nonetheless, Mr. Obama's broad second-term agenda is impressive. It is largely what won him re-election. His task now is to turn his widespread public support into a wedge to break Washington's gridlock.

Group Accuses Yemen of Ignoring Protesters' Killings

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 6

LENGTH: 232 words

SANA, Yemen (AP) -- Human Rights Watch accused Yemen on Tuesday of failing to investigate the 2011 killing of 45 antigovernment protesters during the uprising against former President Ali Abdullah Saleh. 
The group said in a report that top former officials, including Mr. Saleh's relatives, should be held responsible for the deaths in the March 18, 2011, confrontation in which the government unleashed security forces on the demonstrators in the capital, Sana. Mr. Saleh stepped down last year.
Letta Tayler, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch, warned that ''if Yemen doesn't fairly investigate and prosecute those responsible for this deadly attack, it risks perpetuating the culture of impunity at the heart of Yemen's uprising.''
The report said that ''several senior former and current government officials appear to have played a role in the massacre but have not been charged.'' The organization said its report was based on more than 60 interviews. It found that the Central Security Forces, led then by Mr. Saleh's nephew, withdrew from the streets where the shootings took place, but returned to shield the gunmen from protesters.
Besides reopening the investigations, Human Rights Watch recommended that Yemen arrest and prosecute those involved. It also called for an asset freeze and travel ban on current and former officials implicated in the attack and other rights violations.
