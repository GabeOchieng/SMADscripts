L.A. area police on alert for more arsons
On what would already be one of their busiest nights of the year, police and firefighters Saturday were patrolling neighborhoods, taking hotline phone calls and scrambling to identify who was behind the arson fires that have spooked the Hollywood area for two straight nights and were making it an uneasy New Year's Eve in Los Angeles. 
An early evening blaze suggested it could be a long night. Firefighters quickly put out a car fire at about 6 p.m. in Hollywood that "fits the profile of concern" authorities have been following for the arsons, fire department spokesman Brian Humphrey said.
A crew of 10 put out the fire in minutes. The flames did not spread beyond the car and no one was injured. Humphrey could not immediately say how the fire started.
The fire closely resembled more than a dozen set before dawn Saturday, mostly in North Hollywood, and nearly two dozen fires set in and around Hollywood a day earlier.
Though some of the fires spread and damaged homes and apartments, none has brought injuries.

Man with explosivesdetained at airport
http://www.washingtonpost.com/r/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2011/12/31/National-Politics/Graphics/2011%20Year-End%20Report.pdf" title="www.washingtonpost.comA man was detained Saturday after trying to go through a security checkpoint at a Texas airport with explosives in military-grade wrapping, federal and local officials said.
The man was stopped at a security checkpoint at Midland International Airport about 9 a.m. and taken into custody by the FBI, they said.
FBI spokesman Mike Martinez declined to say whether the man was in military uniform or how many explosives were found in the bag. He said he did not know where the man was being held, saying he was at either the airport or at the FBI office in Midland.
Midland police Sgt. Brian Rackow told the Midland Reporter-Telegram and Odessa American that the man identified himself to investigating officials as being active in the military. He and his family had been in the area visiting relatives and were on their way back to his base in North Carolina, Rackow said.
The Transportation Security Administration issued a statement saying one of its officers spotted a suspicious item in a carry-on bag during X-ray screening.

As you probably know, I am an unapologetic liberal. My name appears on a national liberal registry; when moving into a new neighborhood, I have to go door to door and sheepishly inform people that one of my kind is living in their midst. My point is, it should come as no surprise to you that I dislike the Second Amendment and think it should be repealed as obsolete. 
When the Second Amendment was written, the majority of Americans needed firearms. Life was rough and tumble. You had to shoot coyotes for meat. You sometimes had to shoot spiders for meat. If Ichabod the wagonmaster called your  missis a strumpet, you had to kill him. Plus, you might have to form citizen militias to repel invading British troops, which was not as hard as it sounds because they marched 12 abreast and played drums and fifes to let you know where they were. But, still, it took guns.  
Things are different now. Today, most private weapons are owned by a class of rural hobbyists known as "gun enthusiasts," a term newspapers came up with to avoid saying "paranoiacs in bib overalls." These are the sort of people who advertise on _blankarmslist.com, my favorite Web site in the whole world since yesterday, when I learned that it is giving away an AK-47, with mounted bayonet, to the person who brings the most new traffic to its site. 
I want that gun. Please help me get it. 
Now, I know what you are thinking. You are thinking: Why would a genuine recidivist liberal want to own a gas-operated assault rifle that fires projectiles engineered to tumble and fragment in flesh, producing maximum tissue damage; a weapon that is the favorite of Mexican drug cartels and international terrorist organizations; the very weapon found in Osama bin Laden's bedroom? The answer is that if I win, I will have the gun professionally converted into a plowshare, which I will then donate to an Amish village. 
But that can't happen unless you go to the Web site and look around a bit. You'll see it's a type of Craigslist for gun enthusiasts, and I think you'll find it as exciting as I do. Believe me, I say this with all the sincerity of a man who really, really wants to win an AK-47. 
Plus, by familiarizing yourself with this site, you will learn not to judge people too harshly: Gun enthusiasts are not without other interests. It's not all about guns, guns, guns with them. It's also about blackjacks, "spring-assisted stilettos," flamethrowers, firearms concealment vests, and, I swear, grenade launchers. One guy in Oklahoma is selling two homemade cannons that fire bowling balls. 
Also a great deal of good old American bartering goes on. One man in North Carolina is looking for "a small handgun, something I can slide in my front pocket," and offers, in return, college-level tutoring in Shakespeare. (Ha. I kid because I love. He'll cut up your dead deer.) 
Actually, one barterer is an artist. He wants to sell his services in return for a concealed weapon. He does tattoos, and links to some samples of his oeuvre, including a drawing of a man with a cigarette up one nostril and a cigar up the other. 
Okay, so by now you know what you have to do. To make sure your clicks will be credited to me, you have to enter through this portal  - _blankhttp://tinyurl.com/6ph8r3q- which the site administrators made specially for me. 
Now, you might be wondering why they'd cooperate with a card-carrying liberal who was going to make fun of them. The answer is that I never told them exactly what kind of column I wrote, and I'm betting they didn't look it up. They'll be figuring it out right about now, when they're getting a whole passel of clicks from Democrats with advanced degrees. 
In conclusion, _blankhttp://tinyurl.com/6ph8r3q.Thank you.

Homicides fall in D.C., tick up in Pr. George's

BYLINE: Allison Klein;Matt Zapotosky;

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A13

LENGTH: 1601 words

The District and Prince George's County had nearly the same number of homicides in 2011, a major departure from a high 20 years ago, when the city saw 325 more slayings than the county.
It is a shift that reflects a double-digit drop in killings in the District from 2010 to 2011, with an especially noticeable downward trend in the most stubborn crime zones east of the Anacostia River. Just across the border, though, the homicide count in the neighboring communities in Prince George's is surging, and the county as a whole saw a slight increase last year. 
There were 97 slayings in Prince George's in 2011, four more killings than in 2010. In the District, the year saw 109 homicides, down from 132 in 2010 and the lowest homicide total in the city since 1963.
"We share many of the same issues," said D.C. Police Chief Cathy L. Lanier. "Quite a few of our victims come from Prince George's County."  
The police department's 7th District east of the Anacostia River - neighborhoods including Barry Farm and Congress Heights - saw its annual homicide count drop 55 percent, with 24 fewer killings in 2011. Neighborhoods across the border in Prince George's 4th District -  including Hillcrest Heights and Oxon Hill-Glassmanor - saw their count more than double, up by 21 slayings.
Law enforcement officials said the trend along Prince George's border reflects problems that migrated with those who left the District for inside-the-Beltway county neighborhoods, including issues connected with poverty and long-simmering neighborhood disputes.
Some D.C. residents who still see frequent violence in their neighborhoods are weary, and say there's not much to celebrate in the city's declining homicide numbers. 
"I'm slow to get to excited," said the Rev. Donald Isaac, executive director of the East of the River Clergy, Police, Community Partnership. "As soon as you begin to celebrate, it can reverse so quickly." 
Prince George's Police Chief Mark Magaw said crime has long run "back and forth" between the District and Prince George's, and he has pushed this year for increased cooperation between the two police departments.
"It's one big community now," he said. "No longer do we have the luxury of saying, 'We only have to worry up to Southern Avenue,' " one of the borders between the city and county.
Though killings in both the District and Prince George's averaged about two per week during 2011, overall violent crime in the city fell by 10 percent and in the county by 12 percent.
But the city had a 6 percent jump in property crime, largely due to a growing problem with thieves grabbing smartphones, computer tablets and other electronic devices from people and cars. "Snatching electronics is the battle of the century," Lanier said. "It's the single biggest problem I have in term of numbers."

Aiming for fewer than 100
Mayor Vincent C. Gray (D) said that the decline in homicides in the District is encouraging and that the city should work to try to get to fewer than 100 slayings in 2012.
"When people see crime going down like this, especially homicides, they are going to feel safer," Gray said. "My sense is that people do feel safer. On the other hand, when you still see north of 100 homicides in the city, even though it's a stark reduction, people are going to continue to be concerned about it. Some additional vigilance is going to serve you well, too."
Killings in the District have fallen rapidly in recent years, with 2011 bringing the lowest number of slayings in nearly 50 years.
"When I started here in 1990, the two things that used to really bother me was that we were known as the murder capital of the world and the city of unsolved homicides," Lanier said. "Our detectives and our police officers have done an amazing job turning that around. We are no longer either one of those things."
Homicides in Prince George's have been generally trending downward as well, though at a slower pace.
The rest of the region's suburbs have far fewer homicides than the District and Prince George's, with most counties recording 2011 homicide numbers roughly unchanged from the prior year. Fairfax County was an exception, with a decrease from 16 to 8.  
Though Montgomery County had just 16 homicides in 2011, in March it saw one of the year's highest-profile murders in the region when Brittany Norwood, an employee at a Bethesda Lululemon yoga store, fatally bludgeoned and stabbed a co-worker, Jayna Murray.
And in the wealthier neighborhoods of Northwest Washington, where homicides are rare, three killings drew wide attention: a teen was shot on a busy street in Georgetown on Halloween night; socialite Viola Drath was killed in her Georgetown rowhouse in August, allegedly by her husband; and in November, a man was gunned down outside a nightclubin Dupont Circle.
The Northeast quadrant of the city, covered by the 4th and 5th districts, ended the year with a combined eight more killings than in 2010.
Area crime watchers say they've seen violence steadily shift from the District into Prince George's.
The migration of many of the District's poorer residents to inside-the-Beltway communities in Prince George's has been happening for years, fueled by the District tearing down some public housing, said former D.C. police chief Isaac Fulwood Jr., who led the  department in the early 1990s, when the city had nearly 500 homicides a year. 
That shift has had lasting effects, he said. 
"People from D.C. that had to move tended to move to Prince George's County, and they took with them the things that poverty brings: Lack of access to everything," said Fulwood, who is now chairman of the U.S. Parole Commission. 
The Prince George's police department, which has more than 2,000 fewer officers than in the District, was left to deal with neighborhood disputes that people brought with them, as well as new beefs created in the large apartment complexes in Prince George's.
"Alabama Avenue, Stanton Road subsidized housing, all of that is gone," Prince George's Deputy Chief Craig Howard said. "Now when you ride through those areas, there are townhouses, single-family homes."
Last year's killings in Prince George's did not seem to follow any common thread, officials said. Young men and women sometimes killed one another in petty disputes. 
The majority of the killings in Prince George's happen inside the Beltway, a more urban setting than the rest of the county. Because Prince George's has a larger overall population than the District, its homicide rate was lower than the city's, with about 11 killings per 100,000 residents, compared with about 17 per 100,000 residents  in the District.

Closing cases
Across the nation during the first half of last year, the homicide count increased by about 1 percent for cities the size of the District, and remained the same for counties such as Prince George's, according to FBI crime statistics.
Lanier, who hoped to have fewer than 100 homicides in the District in 2011, said she remains frustrated by the numbers. "We're not where we need to be until we have less than 50," she said. 
The Washington Post's homicide count includes criminal killings within the borders of the city or the county, but does not include killings that officials have ruled justified. Prince George's homicide numbers last year included one killing investigated by Laurel police and one on the Bowie State University campus. 
Lanier said the District had fewer gang-related homicides than in prior years. Most killings happened amid personal disputes, often stemming from squabbles at nightclubs where people had been drinking, she said. 
She added that her department's homicide closure rate is about 94 percent, which sends a message to criminals. 
"Word travels pretty quickly when a homicide happens and an arrest is made," Lanier said. "Your risk of being caught is pretty high if you commit a homicide in D.C."
Prince George's police's homicide closure rate was 63 percent last year, a slight increase over 2010.
In Prince George's,16 people were killed in January, including a teenager who used to cook eggs for his 3-year-old brother, an ice cream truck driver and a University of Maryland student who tutored athletes. But by year's end, overall crime had dropped compared with 2010, with violent crime down about 12 percent and property crime down about 10 percent.
Lanier's biggest success was in the 7th District, which has regularly led the city in killings and some other crimes. In 1993, the 7th District alone had 133 homicides. Last year it had 20.
"A lot of it is the officers being out there, being visible," 7th District Commander Joel Maupin said. He said officers continue to take guns off the streets, and often blanket neighborhoods with extra patrols when they get a tip that violence might be coming. 
It is essential, he said, to make arrests in crimes such as robberies and burglaries because it prevents future violence.
"Removing these individuals from the streets and doing it quickly reduces crime," Maupin said.
Isaac, the clergyman who works in the same neighborhoods as Maupin, said his group visits every family that loses someone to violence, offering burial support, grief counseling and other services. "Even if you have one homicide a month, it's impacting out there," Isaac said.

Park ranger fatallyshot after traffic stop
A Mount Rainier National Park ranger was fatally shot Sunday after a routine traffic stop, and authorities closed the 368-square-mile park as they searched for the gunman, a park spokeswoman said. 
The ranger was identified as Margaret Anderson, 34. She had set up a vehicle as a roadblock on a park road just before the 11 a.m. shooting, park spokeswoman Lee Taylor said.
Ed Troyer, a Pierce County sheriff's spokesman, said his department received a report around 11:30 a.m. of shots fired in the park and a ranger in need of help.
When authorities arrived, Troyer said, they also encountered gunfire, but no one else was hit.  Troyer said late Sunday afternoon that authorities had identified  a "strong person of interest" in the slaying.
Authorities believed the gunman was still in the woods, with weapons. They asked people to stay away from the park, and for those already inside to leave.

Suspect in park ranger's killing found dead

DATELINE: MOUNT RAINIER NATIONAL PARK, WASH.

MOUNT RAINIER NATIONAL PARK, Wash. - Authorities said Monday that a body found in Mount Rainier National Park was that of an Iraq war veteran who was a suspect in the shooting death of a park ranger. 
A plane searching the remote wilderness of the park found Benjamin Colton Barnes's body lying partially submerged in an icy, snowy mountain creek with snow banks standing several feet high on both sides.
"He was wearing a T-shirt, a pair of jeans and one tennis shoe. That was it," said Pierce County sheriff's spokesman Ed Troyer. Barnes did not have any external wounds and appears to have died because of the elements, he said. Two weapons also were recovered.
Authorities said they think Barnes, 24, went to the park Sunday to hide after a shooting at a party at a house near Seattle in which four people were wounded. Authorities said they think Barnes shot the ranger, Margaret Anderson, later that day.
Anderson had set up a roadblock to stop a man who had blown through a checkpoint rangers use to check if vehicles have tire chains for winter conditions. A gunman opened fire on her before she was able to get out of her vehicle, authorities say.
Immediately after the park shooting, police cleared Mount Rainier of visitors and mounted a manhunt.
Park superintendent Randy King said Anderson, a 34-year-old mother of two young girls who was married to another Rainier ranger, had served as a park ranger for about four years.
Barnes appears to have had a troubled transition back to civilian life. He was involved in a child-custody dispute in July, during which the mother of his toddler daughter sought a temporary restraining order against him, according to court documents.
The woman told authorities that Barnes was suicidal and possibly suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder after deploying to Iraq in 2007-2008. She said he had once sent her a text message saying "I want to die."
The woman said Barnes easily got irritated, angry and depressed, and kept an arsenal of weapons in his home. She wrote that she feared for their daughter's safety.
In November 2011, a court-appointed guardian recommended parenting and communication classes for both parents, but that Barnes be allowed to continue supervised visits with the child twice a week.

Patience and progress for the Caps

BYLINE: Tarik El-Bashir

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. D01

LENGTH: 914 words

Dale Hunter preached patience from the day he arrived in Washington, acknowledging that a turnaround would take time.
He was right. The process has been slow, sometimes painfully so.
But the Capitals finished 2011 with a flourish, winning three in a row, and they are 4-1-1 in the last six and 8-6-1 since Hunter stepped behind the bench on Nov. 28.
That's not to say they're once again the Stanley Cup favorites the Hockey News ordained them to be in September. But after watching Alex Ovechkin and his teammates soundly defeat the New York Rangers and Buffalo Sabres, then rally on New Year's Eve and steamroll the league-worst Blue Jackets, even hardened skeptics would probably agree the Capitals are moving in the right direction. 
And that U-turn has started with goaltender Tomas Vokoun, who has been on top of his game since reemerging as the Capitals' No. 1 netminder. After serving as the backup for three consecutive games, he has stopped 107 of the 112 shots he's seen since replacing Michal Neuvirth in Buffalo on Dec. 26.
The defense in front of Vokoun has also been trending in the right direction because of Hunter's passive 1-2-2 forecheck and assistant coach Jim Johnson's adjustments in the defensive zone, namely tightening the gap between themselves and attacking players. The most tangible measure of the  defensive zone improvement has been the reduction of odd-man rushes and prime scoring chances against, players said.
"Before we play more wide-open style," Vokoun said. "Now we're definitely a lot more responsible. If we have a breakdown, it's more like a four-on-three, never a two-on-one. It's obviously a difference for the goalie when you don't have to face three breakaways or two-on-one's in one game."
As a result, the Capitals have yielded two goals or fewer in six of the past eight games. In 15 games under Hunter, in fact, they're surrendering an average of 2.33 goals per game, which would be good for sixth in the league. Under Boudreau, they permitted an average of 3.27 per, which would rank 28th.
"Our goaltender will make the save if we give up an outside shot," forward Brooks Laich said. "We've really been aware of not giving up grade-A chances."
In addition to instilling a defensive conscience, Hunter's other primary directive was to flip Ovechkin's "on switch."
We're witnessing progress on that front, too.
Ovechkin has notched six goals and three assists in the past six games, is taking more shots, getting more scoring chances and seems to be more physically involved, even if that physicality isn't always consistent.
Since the coaching change, the former two-time MVP has taken 4.3 shots per game, up from 3.6 before it. He's also getting 3.3 scoring chances per game, up from 2.4 under Boudreau.
"I have more opportunities," said Ovechkin, who was named the NHL's second star of the week Monday. "Right now, I start go to the net more than I usually do. . . . If I had opportunity to shoot, I just have to shoot the puck. If I'm not going to shoot the puck, I'm not going to score. I just change a little bit of [my] game, and you can see [it]."
Hunter said he suspects Ovechkin's surge is connected to the 6-foot-3, 230-pound bulldozer of a left wing throwing his weight around more often.
"Against the Rangers, he had a big hit on [Dan] Girardi, their shutdown 'D'," Hunter said, referring to a first-period, open-ice check Ovechkin dished out in the Capitals' 4-1 win over the Eastern Conference leaders on Dec. 28. "That backs 'em off, and he gets more room."
Ovechkin's reemergence may be the most noticeable, but he isn't the only Young Gun putting up impressive numbers lately. Winger Alexander Semin has joined his close friend and countryman, scoring three goals and five points during the winning streak. Center Nicklas Backstrom, meantime, has a goal and three assists during the recent run.
It's also possible the fourth member - defenseman Mike Green - will rejoin the band this week after missing all but eight games this season due to injuries. Green hinted after practice that he would like to play Tuesday against visiting Calgary.
"As a coach you can't wait to get him back in the lineup," Hunter said. "It's like a Christmas present."
The next test arrives this week, which began with Washington sitting in ninth place in the Eastern Conference but only one point out of sixth.
First, the Capitals host a road-weary Flames team that's lost three straight at Verizon Center, where they've posted the third-best record on home ice this season at 13-5-1. Then they Capitals head to San Jose, where they haven't won since 1993, and Los Angeles, where they haven't won since 2005.
Defenseman Karl Alzner senses an opportunity in the coming weeks.
"In January and February, guys' heads start to wander a little bit, at least until the all-star break comes," he said. "So this is a good opportunity to win some games and surprise some teams."
By most measures, the Capitals closed out 2011 headed in the right direction. Now everyone is wondering whether it's a long- or a short-term turnaround.
It was the question of the day Monday at Kettler Capitals Iceplex, where the tone in the dressing room was upbeat. It was also optimistic, albeit cautious.
"I don't think we can be patting too much ourselves on the back," Vokoun said. "We're certainly not anywhere near where we should be. Our play has improved, but we have a ways to go to be in the standings where we want to be."

49ers' Roman is Penn St. finalist, agent says

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. D02

LENGTH: 645 words

The agent for San Francisco 49ers offensive coordinator Greg Roman says his client is a finalist to replace Joe Paterno as head coach at Penn State.
Mike Harrison said Roman interviewed for the position in November and is on the "short list" at the embattled program, rocked in recent months by a sex-abuse scandal. Harrison said he expects to know in about a week whether Roman will be hired but declined to say whether Roman would finish the season with the NFC West champion 49ers (13-3).
Harrison said Roman - who came to the 49ers from Stanford along with Coach Jim Harbaugh - was offered the Tulane job to replace Bob Toledo. The school hired Curtis Johnson. . . . 
Georgetown junior guard Sugar Rodgers was selected the Big East women's basketball player of the week. She averaged 36.5 points in the Hoyas' two wins. 
Maryland sophomore forward Alyssa Thomas was chosen the ACC women's basketball player of the week. Thomas averaged 17.0 points and 6.0 rebounds per game for the Terrapins.

PRO BASKETBALL
San Antonio Spurs guard Manu Ginobili broke his left hand against Minnesota and is out indefinitely.
A two-time all-star, Ginobili was injured when he fouled Anthony Tolliver as he rose to shoot the ball late in the second quarter Monday night. Ginobili immediately grabbed his shooting hand and crouched in pain.
Ginobili was taken for X-rays, which revealed a broken fifth metacarpal, below his pinkie. . . .
New York Knicks forward Amare Stoudemire missed his second straight game because of a sprained left ankle. He said he was feeling better and hopes to play Wednesday. . . . 
Forward Kris Humphries missed the New Jersey Nets' game against the Indiana Pacers because of a sore left shoulder.

BASEBALL
Hanley Ramirez says he'll accept a position switch to third base so Miami Marlins newcomer Jose Reyes can play shortstop.
When Reyes signed a six-year, $106 million deal with Miami last month, there was speculation Ramirez was unhappy about being supplanted at short. But Manager Ozzie Guillen sold Ramirez on the idea.
"I have spoken with Guillen," Ramirez said. "What we want is to win with the Marlins. We will see what's going to happen with the position switch and everything else. If it's third base, okay. Wherever they put me to win, I will do so."

HOCKEY
Florida Coach Kevin Dineen says he expects the NHL to quickly complete its review of an incident in which Panthers forward Krys Barch allegedly made a racial slur during a game.
Barch was ejected from Florida's win over Montreal on Saturday. The Miami Herald reported a linesman heard an inappropriate comment directed toward defenseman P.K. Subban. . . .

Hems, but few haws, in 'Work It'

BYLINE: Hank Stuever

SECTION: STYLE; Pg. C01

LENGTH: 1062 words

In trying to make any sense of ABC's duuuuummmmb new Tuesday night sitcom, "Work It," it's quite tempting to rummage through centuries of examples that might help us deconstruct modern civilization's endless fixation for putting a man in a dress for comic effect. But for the purposes of this particular bit of TV criticism, we needn't travel any further back than 1980, when Tom Hanks and Peter Scolari played "Bosom Buddies." In an unseemly display of uncreditedcloset-raiding, "Work It" is just "Bosom Buddies" with a smokier eye.
Whether you're talking about Milton Berle, Bugs Bunny or the ancient Greeks, bad drag is one of the oldest jokes around, and there is some debate about whether it works the way it used to, thanks mainly to the tireless efforts of professional drag queens, who've upped the game considerably, and proponents of transgender rights, who've had it with pop culture's mockery and bias. 
Now a man wearing a dress is just a regressive bit of vaudeville that can, from a certain view, seem as outdated as blackface.  
"Work It" attempts - badly - to translate a subset of America's present unemployment woes, particularly as those statistics apply to jobless men. Amid a so-called "mancession,"  the numbers could suggest a gender imbalance that favors women.
Ben Koldyke plays Lee Standish, a husband and father in St. Louis who was once a top salesman at a Pontiac dealership, until Pontiac went kaput during the GM bailout. With no luck on the job search, he hears that a pharmaceutical giant is hiring sales reps. However: "We're only looking for girls," another sales rep tells Lee.
"Why?" he asks.
"Well, we've had some guys [as salesmen]," she says, "but the doctors seem to want to nail them less."
Rather than file an EEOC complaint (or point out that not all doctors are men), Lee's natural response is to raid his wife's closet and visit his local MAC counter. Voila - awkward transformation. With "her" impeccable sales rֳ©sumֳ©, Lady Lee gets the pharmaceutical sales job.
The laughs could not be thinner. The show's comedy is predicated on the fact that none of Lee's female co-workers seem able to discern the obvious (she's a man, baby), probably because they are too busy living down to every lame stereotype associated with office women, up to and including the itty-bitty salads they nibble at lunch. As an actor, Koldyke is terrible at being a woman, but he's also not very entertaining as a man. He's a drawing of a man wearing women's clothing.
Fortunately - which also means unfortunately - there's Angel Ortiz (played by Amaury Nolasco), Lee's bosom bud, who used to work as a mechanic in the Pontiac service department. Lee tells Angel his new secret and, soon enough, Angel puts on a skirt and gets a sales-rep job, too - and his drag is somehow just a little bit better than Lee's, and an immeasurable fraction more funny, but that still doesn't do much to give the show spark.
Certainly we could all find something better to watch, but that's also what I thought about Tim Allen's creaky "Last Man Standing," which is also airing on ABC Tuesday nights. It, too, is bloated with outdated sitcom humor about the sexes, and it turned out to be a relative ratings smash.
I wish I could regard "Work It" as harmless fun for the viewers who can stand to subject themselves to it, but there are other issues for us all to think about here. Have you looked at television lately? It's full of men submitting to various emasculations - on sitcoms, in dramadies, on beer commercials - but it's also lousy with a retro sense of sexism against women. "Work It" repeatedly underlines an offensive notion that nothing could be more humiliating for today's man than to have to become a woman.
There's also another issue afoot, having to do with actual men who desire to live as women. We still have a long way to go in our culture when it comes to accepting the rights of those who question or alter their birth gender, and who knows if we'll all ever arrive at the same page on this.
But now, even the word "trans" (and the more slangy "tranny") has become a loaded gun in mass media, with the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) issuing public rebukes to those who throw the word "tranny" and "trans" around in off-the-cuff fun. These words vernacularly rocketed forward about four years ago, when a "Project Runway" contestant started saying "tranny" and "hot tranny mess" as a way to express his displeasure at bad fashion. 
After years of tranny-this and tranny-that, the word police struck back on behalf of the transgendered community. Now, even well-meaning gay and gay-friendly celebs (Neil Patrick Harris, Kelly Osbourne and the writers of "Glee," to name but a few) are lectured by GLAAD and others about the improper use of the T-word.
GLAAD has called on ABC to pre-cancel "Work It," because, as the organization's acting president, Mike Thompson, said in press release, "Transphobia is still all too prevalent in our society, and this show will only contribute to it. It will reinforce the mistaken belief that transgender women are simply 'men pretending to be women,' and that their efforts to live their lives authentically as women are a form of lying or deception."
I can sympathize with GLAAD up to a point (and I'm all for the concept of canceling a show before it stinks up the schedule) but not to this particular point. "Work It" doesn't need to be canceled for its insensitivity so much as it needs to be canceled for its vapidity and lack of originality. There may be some humor left in cross-dressing comedy, but it would have to be done with nuance and sharp wit - and the freedom to throw around a word like "tranny" if need be.
When I was in high school, the highest form of assembly humor was to tart up the football players in cheerleader uniforms and lipstick and have them flounce around the stage. Curiously, nobody laughed harder at this than the girls. Any PhD candidate in anthropology would recognize and duly footnote such an array of gender bugaboos, whether they are observed in an auditorium or in a remote jungle. 
Or on television. Bad drag says so much about men and women, and often what it says isn't flattering to our mutual intelligence. "Work It" is a big step back, aimed at a thoroughly brain-dead audience.

Fencing master coached film stars

BYLINE: T. Rees Shapiro

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B04

LENGTH: 691 words

Bob Anderson, 89, a fencing master who coached British Olympians before becoming Hollywood's premier choreographer of sword-fighting, tutoring the likes of Sean Connery, Errol Flynn and Lindsay Lohan in the art of the blade, died Jan. 1 at a hospital in West Sussex, England.
His death was confirmed by Philip Bruce, the president of the British Academy of Fencing. 
For more than six decades, Mr. Anderson's talents both as fencer and teacher were on display in many of the most swashbuckling of all Hollywood action epics. Thrust and parry, the clang of steel on steel, through corridors, up and down stairways of medieval castles - Mr. Anderson showed some of the world's best-known actors how to do it.
http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0026428/Mr. Anderson secretly earned an enduring place in cinematic lore as the man behind the mask and light saber of archvillain Darth Vader in two "Star Wars" films.
Mr. Anderson's role as Vader's on-screen stunt double in the epic light saber battles of "The Empire Strikes Back" (1980) and "Return of the Jedi" (1983) went uncredited.
In "Empire," it is Mr. Anderson who severs the right hand of Luke Skywalker, played by Mark Hamill, in the climactic scene where Vader, voiced by James Earl Jones, says to Luke, "I am your father."
During a 1983 interview, Hamill revealed that Mr. Anderson had stepped in for actor David Prowse for Vader's light saber fights.
"Bob worked so bloody hard that he deserves some recognition," Hamill told Starlog magazine, noting that he had told director George Lucas it had been unfair to keep Mr. Anderson's contribution secret.
Mr. Anderson's career in films as a stunt double and sword master began in the 1950s and continued into the 2000s. He enjoyed pointing out that after editing a film for certain sequences, he sometimes ended up on both ends of a duel - occasionally fighting himself to the death.
His credits included "The Princess Bride" (1987), the Lord of the Rings trilogy (2000s), and a 1998 remake of "The Parent Trap," for which Mr. Anderson instructed a freckly-faced youth - Lohan.
He trained the rapier-rattling heroes played by Charlie Sheen and Kiefer Sutherland for "The Three Musketeers" (1993). He was Connery's double in "Highlander" (1986). He perfected the swordsmanship of Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom in "Pirates of the Carribbean" (2003).
"The sword is the ultimate weapon," Mr. Anderson told the Los Angeles Times in 1995. 
"It's not so threatening shooting at someone 20 or 30 paces away or while hiding behind things. When you get into a sword fight, you're standing toe-to-toe with someone who's trying to kill you and you're looking him in the eye - now that's thrilling."
For a revival of the Zorro franchise, Mr. Anderson taught Antonio Banderas, Anthony Hopkins and Catherine Zeta-Jones.
"We used to call him Grumpy Bob on the set, he was such a perfectionist," Martin Campbell, director of "The Mask of Zorro" (1998) and "The Legend of Zorro" (2005), told the New York Times in 2001. "He was incredibly inventive and also refused to treat any of the actors as stars. They would complain about the intensity of the training, but having worked with him there's nobody I'd rather use."
Robert James Gilbert Anderson was born Sept. 15, 1922, in Hampshire, England. Survivors include his wife, Pearl, and three children.
He started fencing during a stint in the British Royal Marines during World War II and earned a number of championships during his military service. He competed for Britain in the 1952 Olympics at Helsinki, where his team tied for fifth in the saber event.
After leaving the military, he was named coach of the British national team and led his team to six consecutive Olympic games, including silver-medal-winning appearances in Rome in 1960 and Tokyo in 1964.
His work in filmmaking began in 1953 when he appeared in "The Master of Ballantrae" as a stunt double opposite Flynn. While rehearsing one duel, Mr. Anderson accidentally cut Flynn on the thigh.
Although Flynn claimed responsibility for the mistake, Mr. Anderson was known for a short time around Hollywood film sets as "the man who stabbed Errol Flynn."

Creating the scars of war to help tell a character's story

BYLINE: Jessica Goldstein

SECTION: STYLE; Pg. C03

LENGTH: 1049 words

The first thing you notice when you look at the poster for Studio Theatre's "Time Stands Still" is the right side of Holly Twyford's face.
Twyford has been a staple in Washington theater for almost 20 years. In "Time Stands Still," she plays Sarah, an injured photojournalist just back home from Iraq. Half of her body bears the marks of a shrapnel explosion, deep red slices across one side of her forehead, along the line of her jaw, down to the top of her chest. 
She's scarred. There's something visceral about the noun-as-verb, how something that sits on the surface of your skin can become this active descriptor of who you are, of what happened to you, of what you'll be carrying around forever.
"I think I read this script right around when Tim Hetherington was killed," said Twyford, referring to the photographer-filmmaker who was fatally wounded in Libya last spring. "And I was immediately struck by how timely this was."  
When we spoke, Twyford had worn the scars only twice. "I can barely feel them if I don't touch them," she said. "I'm looking forward to having them on."
Skip Smith, the makeup artist for "Time Stands Still," described the process of designing the scars. "I asked the director [Susan Fenichell], 'How intense do you want this?' Because this is not a horror makeup. . . . It's more of a disfigurement."
"I developed a stencil system," Smith explained. "Using soft vinyl material, I cut the shapes of the shrapnel scars and the stencil matches up underneath her eye, up to her ear, and another fits on her jaw up to her neck. And there's another that's a general stencil to place all over." The scars take 30 to 40 minutes to apply. "We're also using a plasticized scar material for some of the scars to give a raised look that's more realistic."
The end result, though not "like a 'Phantom of the Opera' reveal" as Smith said, is still a striking one. It's hard to look away. 
But Twyford says Sarah's struggles don't revolve around appearance. "She's not ashamed. . . . There's a line in the play, someone says to her, 'There's surgery to remove the scars if they bother you.' And Sarah says, 'They don't.' I think she's being honest there."

Unfaithful
"The Religion Thing" is the inaugural play in Theater J's "Locally Grown" festival, featuring work by D.C. area playwrights. The show, which opens Wednesday, focuses on two couples: one an interfaith husband and wife and the other their longtime friend, a recent born-again Christian, and her new honey, whom she met at a church mixer. The evangelicals are devout in their devotion to both God and each other.
Chris Stezin, plays "a non-observant Jewish guy married to a lapsed Catholic," half of a couple who, as they age, "begin to miss the rituals of their childhoods and, I think, the substance that observing those rituals lends. . . . They try to navigate this minefield."
Renee Calarco, the playwright, described herself as "Jewish and somewhat observant. . . . My mother is Jewish. My father was Catholic and he converted before marrying my mother. So half of my extended family is Catholic.
"Oddly enough it's been a defining thing in my life. . . . How do you relate as a Jew in a Christian world?"
Calarco is an award-winning playwright (her "Short Order Stories" earned the 2007 Charles MacArthur Award for outstanding new play) who initially wrote "The Religion Thing" as a 10-minute play in 2004. 
Religion, she said, is one of those issues that even the irreligious confront. "There are times when I think we all struggle with faith and the role of faith in our lives."
"This play is about the things we put aside when we're in relationships," said Joseph Thornhill, who plays multiple roles in the show. "You want to have a life with somebody, so . . . you put off making decisions on things that don't seem relevant at the time. In this case, it's religion. But it could be about anything."
Theater J suggests the show is suitable for viewers 17 or older because of sexual content and language. "I have a few favorite lines," Stezin said, "most of which are unprintable."
Wednesday to Jan. 29, 1529 16th St. NW, www.dcjcc.org/center-for-arts/theater-j, 800-494-8497.

Just like a woman
Hedda Gabler, said Robert McNamara, artistic director of SCENA Theatre, "is like a female Hamlet."
This is not just because SCENA's production of "Hedda Gabler," opening Jan. 12, sets the story in 1938 Norway. Scandinavian similarities aside, Hedda Gabler is "an individual in a society held down."
"She can be a cold [and] evil woman," McNamara said. "To others, she's someone who is trapped in a dead society and is trying to make a breakthrough, to find a life of her own. [The play is] looking at someone in a two-day period of time and all the chances and opportunities to grow are taken away from her. . . . All is not well in the state of Norway."
McNamara also cites Gabler's world's eerie resemblance to D.C. "She's in there talking about 'If I could just get out of here, but I don't have the courage.' She's afraid of scandal. And that's what Washington thrives on today. She's way ahead of her time."
"She's trapped in a very bourgeoisie environment that is not suited for her big personality," said Kerry Waters, who plays the title role. Waters is a D.C. theater veteran who has directed as well as performed in Washington, and her husband, Eric Lucas, is also in the "Hedda Gabler" cast. 
Gabler "is like a child in some respects," Waters said. "As smart as she is, she's unsocialized. She's isolated. So she's like a trapped animal that's just ready to leap out of the cage and do something very dangerous, and she does.
"I'm trying to find sympathy for her in my interpretation. I'm focusing on, underneath it, her vulnerability and self-doubt. Her frustration with the people around her because she has a very keen intelligence. She's sort of a thwarted artistic genius. . . . She's looking for inspiration and she can't find it. And she's pregnant, and she doesn't want to be.
"It's a great leading lady role in the tradition of great theater. And I get to shoot a gun!" she added. "I get to shoot a pistol on stage. That's fun, too."

Taking off the safety

BYLINE: Editorial Board

PARK RANGER MARGARET ANDERSON was operating a roadblock in Mount Rainier National Park on New Year's Day to prevent cars without snow chains from proceeding up the mountain. What should have been a routine assignment turned deadly, authorities say, when Benjamin Colton Barnes tried to evade a stop by shooting repeatedly into the side of Ms. Anderson's patrol car. The barrage killed the 34-year-old mother of two little girls. 
This was not the first violent incident of the day involving Mr. Barnes, officials said. In the first few hours of 2012, Mr. Barnes and a group of friends were playing "show and tell" with their guns when a fight broke out and Mr. Barnes and another individual are believed to have shot four people. Mr. Barnes then traveled to Mount Rainier to hide from authorities. After shooting the park ranger, Mr. Barnes escaped into the woods; he was found hours later frozen to death, wearing only a T-shirt and jeans, with a knife, ammunition and at least two firearms, including an assault-style weapon.
Mr. Barnes apparently was an emotionally plagued young man. He served a tour of duty in Iraq in 2007 but was discharged from the military some two years later after a drunk driving incident and improper transport of a private weapon, according to The Seattle Times. An ex-girlfriend, with whom he has an infant daughter, filed for a restraining order over the summer after describing Mr. Barnes as erratic and possibly suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. She noted that Mr. Barnes owned a small arsenal. One photograph released by Washington state law enforcement officials show a bare-chested Mr. Barnes brandishing two assault-style weapons. Did officials follow-up on the ex-girlfriend's complaint or ask whether someone as apparently unstable as Mr. Barnes should be permitted to own and keep guns?
It is unclear when and how Mr. Barnes obtained the weapons, but it probably was not difficult to do so. Washington has among the most lax gun laws in the country, requiring neither training nor permits before a purchase. The state does not compel registration and allows individuals without a serious criminal record or history of mental illness to obtain permits to carry a concealed weapon. 
There is no way to know whether tougher gun restrictions would have prevented Mr. Barnes from obtaining his weapons. But it is beyond dispute that easy access to firearms can quickly turn a simple argument or difficult situation into a deadly confrontation. And this violence is not limited to the proverbial mean streets. That terrible lesson was again imparted on New Year's Day when the life of a young woman was cut short in one of the country's most tranquil and majestic sites.

Red Line: From 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. each weekday, trains will share tracks between Van Ness and Friendship Heights while workers replace rails and crossties.
At night, Metro continues to replace track circuits. That work will take place between Friendship Heights and Medical Center.
Beginning at 10 p.m. Wednesday, trains will single-track between Friendship Heights and Medical Center to create a safe area for the track-circuit work.
Between Takoma and Forest Glen, crews will be rehabilitating platforms and stations. Trains will operate about every 24 minutes in each direction, but there will be extra trains from Gallery Place after events at Verizon Center.
Orange Line: From 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. each weekday, trains will share tracks between Clarendon and Ballston, where workers are replacing rails and crossties. Expect minor delays.
Beginning at 10 each night through Thursday, trains will share tracks between Smithsonian and Eastern Market.
Trains also will be single-tracking between East Falls Church and West Falls Church. This work is part of the Dulles Silver Line project.
Blue Line: Beginning at 10 o'clock each night through Thursday, trains will share tracks between Smithsonian and Eastern Market. This is the same corridor the Orange Line trains use, and the work zone is the one for the coming switch replacement.

Four killed as Libyan militias battle on street in capital

TRIPOLI, LIBYA - Four fighters were killed in a gunbattle between Libyan militias on one of Tripoli's busiest streets Tuesday, a fresh sign that the country's government is struggling to control the increasingly fractious groups that overthrew Moammar Gaddafi. 
Former rebels from Tripoli controlling a security compound in the capital fought off dozens of fighters from the city of Misurata who were trying to seize a group of prisoners in a gunbattle that lasted more than an hour, medics and former rebels said.
Real power still resides with the militias more than two months after they captured and killed Gaddafi, observers say. They have carved up the capital and the country into fiefdoms, each holding out for the share of long-term power they say they are owed.
After Tuesday's clash, armed men combed central Tripoli looking for Misuratan fighters. A witness saw them capture one man, and kick and punch him as he was marched into the compound.
A pickup truck daubed with the words "The Defense Brigade, Misurata Revolutionaries" lay across Zawiyah Street, riddled with bullets and with bloodstains on the back seat. One fighter said 11 militiamen from Misurata had been captured.
The battle was the first between militias since Dec. 11, when soldiers from Libya's new army fought militiamen for control of the capital's international airport.
Rival militias with regional allegiances control several compounds abandoned by Gaddafi loyalists as they were overrun in August. Rebels from Misurata, in particular, hold a vast arsenal of tanks, rockets and guns.
Militias were given a Dec. 20 deadline to leave the capital. They have dismantled most of their checkpoints and have limited their presence on Tripoli's streets since then, but they have kept some bases, saying they will hand them over to the state when adequate security forces are in place.
Vehicles carrying dozens of fighters and heavy-caliber machine guns blocked roads leading to the compound, and snipers were stationed on rooftops.
"The people who caused the problem were arrested and will face justice," said Abdel Hakim Belhadj, a member of the Tripoli Military Council, which says it has a mandate from Libya's rulers to secure the capital.

Arab group may order monitors out of Syria

DATELINE: BEIRUT

BEIRUT - The Arab League called Tuesday for an emergency meeting to discuss whether to withdraw the group's monitors from Syria, where security forces are still killing protesters despite the observers' presence, an Arab official said. 
The ministerial meeting is to take place Saturday in Cairo, where the Arab League is based. The body's deputy secretary general, Ahmed bin Heli, said it will look into the first report by the head of the monitoring mission, which began Dec. 27.
Another official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the meeting will discuss whether to pull out the monitors because of the ongoing violence. Participants will not make a final decision, officials said, but will send their recommendations to another, high-level ministerial meeting. 
Meanwhile, Syrian activists reported more bloodshed Tuesday.
The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that as dozens of soldiers were defecting in the southern village of Jassem, they came under fire from security forces. The clash killed at least 18 of the government troops, the observatory said. Security forces later raided the area and detained more than 100 people, it said.
The group also said that security forces fatally shot three people in the restive city of Homs and three in the central province of Hama. The Local Coordination Committees, an umbrella group of activists, reported a higher toll, saying security forces killed four people in Homs, one in the Damascus suburb of Kafr Batna and four in Hama.
Also Tuesday, French President Nicolas Sarkozy accused Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad of "barbarous repression" and demanded that he step down, saying the government is massacring its own people. Syrians should be allowed to determine their own future, Sarkozy said.
There are about 100 Arab League monitors in Syria, dispatched to verify the government's compliance with an Arab League plan to stop its crackdown on a nine-month-old uprising. Syria agreed to the plan Dec. 19.
But activists say hundreds have been slain in the week since the observers started work.
On Monday, league chief Nabil Elaraby acknowledged ongoing bloodshed but insisted that the observer mission has obtained important concessions from the government, such as the withdrawal of heavy weapons from cities.
Opposition groups have been deeply critical of the mission, saying it is simply giving Assad cover for his crackdown. The Local Coordination Committees says that the observer mission is witnessing mainly government-staged events.
The United Nations' last estimate, given several weeks ago, was that more than 5,000 people have been killed since the revolt erupted in mid-March. But since that report, activists say, hundreds more have been killed.
Syria has banned most foreign journalists from the country and prevented independent reporting, making it difficult to confirm claims from either side.

A portrait of a safer city emerges from D.C. crime statistics

BYLINE: Mike DeBonis

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B02

LENGTH: 737 words

Police Chief Cathy L. Lanier had a full house Friday afternoon in her command center, down the hall from her office on the top floor of D.C. police headquarters. There, with Mayor Vincent C. Gray (D), Lanier took what's become a ritual victory lap, touting another record decline in the city's homicide count.
This year, the number dropped from 132 to 108. "People are feeling safer, because they are safer," Gray said. 
Are they? Much is made of year-to-year homicide totals. What figure more concisely captures the condition of a city than its needless waste of human life? But a broader look at 2011's crime figures paint a more complete portrait of a District that has, in fact, become remarkably safer.
Reporting on crime trends in this town tends to follow a formula: Police and politicians try to highlight the good stats and take credit for the successes. The Fraternal Order of Police and other department critics try to show how things aren't so hunky-dory, and they use their stats to thrash management. I turned instead to the D.C. Crime Policy Institute, which was funded by the city in 2009 to research D.C. crime trends and policing. Executive Director John Roman and his colleagues at the nonpartisan Urban Institute are crunching crime data and trying to develop policy recommendations to help authorities improve their tactics and strategies. Roman reviewed the 2011 figures and shared his thoughts, starting with the homicide figure.
"It's remarkable, frankly," Roman said. "D.C. compares very well to just about any other city." Homicide rates are down across the country, he acknowledges, but the approximately 40 percent decline D.C. has seen since 2008 makes the city stand out among its peers. But there's more good news:
lViolent crime more broadly is on the wane. It's not just homicide. Armed robberies fell 12 percent, and assault with a dangerous weapon fell 4 percent, according to D.C. police.  And note that recent Census Bureau estimates indicate that the District's population has increased more than 8 percent since 2000. "To have these declines when there's that sort of population growth is really an achievement," Roman said. Some of that decline follows national trends, he said, but the decline in the District exceeds those trends.
lThefts are way up. Some property crimes, including auto thefts and burglaries,  declined in 2011, but those improvements were eclipsed by 12 percent surges in nonviolent thefts and unarmed robberies. That, Roman said, is more indicative of a growing and prosperous city rife with criminal opportunities than of a policing breakdown. "The theft risk is related to how much stuff you have and how many stores there are and how well they can monitor inventory and detect thefts," he said.
Lanier blamed the increase on street thefts of devices such as smartphones and portable music players. Roman, who has studied those thefts, said the District doesn't collect precise-enough data to pass judgment on that claim, but he said the phenomenon is, though real, easily prevented through personal precautions. "By carrying an expensive electronic device, you're making yourself more of a target," he said. "People don't like to hear that message, but it's an important one."
lPolice deployment appears to be effective. Lanier's department has put its focus on reducing violent crime, focusing on taking guns off the street, tracking repeat offenders and defusing gang beefs before they escalate. "It's a pretty effective strategy," Roman said. What wouldn't be nearly as effective, he added, would be to react rashly to the theft increase. "You could put a cop on every corner," he said. "You could put a Metro officer in every subway car. That would deter this kind of crime, but at an enormous cost and, potentially, the cost of taking your eye off the ball of violence prevention."
Besides the thefts, there are a few pockets of bad news: an increase in sex assaults east of the Anacostia River, for one. But Roman said that figure, representing a few dozen crimes, is of limited statistical significance and should not detract from years of progress. "I still find that the general public is not aware that we've had this 20-year crime decline, and crime levels are now at levels we haven't seen since the '60s," said Roman, 42. "If you're my age or younger, this is as safe as it's ever been, and that's the headline."

Man admits to arsons at five sites
A man who confessed to a string of New Year's Day arson attacks at an Islamic cultural center and four other sites where he had personal grievances was arrested on a hate crime charge, police said. 
Ray Lazier Lengend, a 40-year-old of Guyanese descent, hurled crude firebombs at the Islamic center in part because he wasn't allowed to use its bathrooms, a law enforcement official said.
Lengend was tracked through a stolen car with Virginia license plates believed to be at the scene of at least two of the attacks Sunday evening on a convenience store, three homes and the cultural center, police said. He was arrested Tuesday on charges including one count of arson as a hate crime, four counts of arson and five counts of criminal possession of a weapon, they said.
Lengend, who lives in Queens, was taken to a hospital for a psychiatric examination Tuesday night. He remained in custody and couldn't be reached to comment. A man who answered a telephone call at Lengend's home declined to give any information and hung up.
The suspect is believed to have been kicked out of the convenience store on Dec. 27 for allegedly trying to steal milk and a coffee drink in a glass bottle, authorities said.

Group fights releaseof abuse records
An advocacy group for victims of clergy abuse will fight a court order requiring it to disclose what could be years' worth of e-mails and other records to attorneys for a Roman Catholic priest accused of sexual abuse, a group official said Tuesday.
David Clohessy, the director of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, said that last week's order requiring it to turn over records to attorneys for the Rev. Michael Tierney is too broad, and that the group is weighing its options for fighting the order.
The state Supreme Court on Monday refused to intervene on SNAP's behalf, rendering its decision after Clohessy was deposed in St. Louis.

Details emerge about Mount Rainier killing
As Mount Rainier National Park remained closed for a third day Tuesday following the fatal shooting of a park ranger, authorities said suspected gunman Benjamin Colton Barnes was involved in a weapons "show and tell" session that erupted in gunfire only hours before the confrontation in the mountains.
The report from the King County Sheriff's Department provides the first details of the New Year's Eve party that Barnes, 24, attended before his trip to Mount Rainier, where  ranger Margaret Anderson, 34, was killed while creating a roadblock to stop him.
Barnes's body was found Monday in a snowy creek. He apparently succumbed to the elements.

Finding joy in a Quirky Family

BYLINE: Ron Charles

SECTION: STYLE; Pg. C01

LENGTH: 919 words

Philip Larkin's bitter poem about the influence of our parents - "They [mess] you up, your mum and dad" - could be the epigraph of Joe Dunthorne's second novel, "Wild Abandon." But Dunthorne marinates dysfunction in sweet absurdity to produce a wry comedy, the latest addition to that black-sheep genre known as Quirky Families. You've seen these people: They're staples of indie films such as "Little Miss Sunshine" or novels such as Kevin Wilson's recent "The Family Fang." In such stories, psychological abuse or parental neglect that should poison precocious children is somehow ameliorated by affection and irony. On good days, that strikes me as a perfectly realistic view, and Dunthorne is one of its wittiest proponents. His first novel, "Submarine" (2008), was enthusiastically compared to "The Catcher in the Rye" and attracted even more attention when Richard Ayoade's movie adaptation was released last year.  
While "Submarine" stayed locked in the hilarious diary voice of a 15-year-old boy, "Wild Abandon" moves through the eccentrics at a dying commune in South Wales with the tortured Welsh name of Blaen-y-Llyn. As a locale for satire, that's pretty much shooting freaks in a barrel, but Dunthorne never reduces these characters entirely to farce. He's more interested in the common comedy of their lives than in their bizarre peculiarities, although they certainly sport those. 
Founded two decades ago in the early 1990s, this self-sustaining 50-acre farm is a cookie jar of weirdos who make their own shampoo and drink goat's milk. (Not that there's anything wrong with that.) "The combination of a ruthless selection process and a high likelihood of mental illness among the applicants" has produced a community of about 20 misfits, half of whom are just passing through as "wwoofers" - volunteers for "World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms."
"Wild Abandon" opens as the commune faces several existential threats, although everybody's too cool or passive-aggressive to let on that anything's wrong. Their money comes largely from Patrick, a retired greeting-card executive who lives in a decaying geodesic dome that "must have looked like the future when it was built." When not pining for another one of the founding members who makes "proto-Gothic recycled jewelry," Patrick is growing paranoid that the group tolerates his presence only because he's wealthy. If he weren't perpetually stoned, he might be able to think this through more clearly.
His pompous friend Don Riley is the group's nominal leader and one of Dunthorne's funniest creations. Like any good leftie commander, Don spurns actual work and spends most of his time in a blue kimono polishing inspirational phrases "in the well-attended auditorium of his mind." He's often moved to tears by his deeper-than-thou sensitivity. His far-more-grounded wife is growing increasingly frustrated by "the gap between Don as he viewed himself, and the reality."
The real gems here, though, are Don's two children, who quickly become the focus of the novel and confirm the evidence in "Submarine" that Dunthorne is a genius at depicting young people. Seventeen-year-old Kate is sharp enough to see this strange place for what it is, and she knows her civilian friends must never see her there. In the outside world her mother seems like a "woodland troll. . . . Her clothes looked sad - frowning, drooping, washed at low temperature." But Kate's secret apostasy is mitigated by a surprisingly mature affection for the people who've raised her. She's won permission to attend school in town, where she can learn something besides the hodgepodge of home lessons on cinquecento Italian architecture, centrifugal force and TV advertising, and she's eagerly planning her departure for college. But that means leaving behind her 11-year-old brother Albert, one of the funniest, most poignant kids I've run across in fiction.
Good novels about siblings are surprisingly rare considering how many of us have them and what a subtle, complex relationship they pose. The beauty of Dunthorne's portrayal here is how well he captures Kate's fraying sense of responsibility for her brother, an enthusiastic little boy who's part action hero and part concierge. Achingly guileless, he's an expert on how much dirt his belly button can hold, what lasers can kill dinosaurs and how to answer the phone properly: "You have reached the forefront of human development," he calmly announces to anyone who calls. 
His winning goofiness, though, is complicated by loneliness, an increasing awareness that, as he tells his sister, "I don't have anything in common with people my own age." Realizing that Kate is about to leave him and that his parents' marriage is breaking up, Alfred grows obsessed with the imminent end of the world. That worrisome turn of mind drives the story close to tragedy, but Dunthorne keeps tight control and steers this endearing novel away from pathos or sentimentality right to the very last line.
With its frizzy comedy about real people emerging mournfully from an unreal place, "Wild Abandon" had me pestering my wife with favorite lines till she promised to read it. Dunthorne is best with those complications of family affection, that mingling of love and annoyance that can make you laugh and choke up even if you've never lived on a Welsh commune and harvested your own kale.

Libyan leader fears militia-driven civil war

BYLINE: Mahmoud Habboush;Ali Shuaib

LENGTH: 417 words

DATELINE: TRIPOLI, LIBYA

TRIPOLI, Libya - Libya risks sliding into civil war unless it cracks down on the rival militias that filled the vacuum left by Moammar Gaddafi's downfall, the head of the interim administration said after an outbreak of violence in the capital. 
Mustafa Abdel Jalil, chairman of the Transitional National Council, issued the stark warning in response to a gun battle between militias in one of Tripoli's busiest streets Tuesday that killed four fighters.
More than two months after anti-Gaddafi forces captured and killed the former  leader, Libya's new rulers are still struggling to exert their authority as rival militia leaders refuse to cede control of their fighters and hand in their arms.
 "We are now between two bitter options," Abdel Jalil told a gathering in the eastern city of Benghazi late Tuesday. Either "we deal with these violations strictly and put the Libyans in a military confrontation that we don't accept," he said, "or we split, and there will be a civil war."
The militias, drawn from dozens of towns and ideological camps, led the nine-month uprising, backed by NATO airstrikes, to end Gaddafi's 42-year rule. Now, though, they appear to believe they must keep an armed presence in the capital to ensure they receive their share of political power.
The transitional council has begun to form a fully functioning army and police force to take over the task of providing security, although Abdel Jalil has acknowledged that progress has been too slow.
Tripoli is now an unruly patchwork of fiefdoms, each controlled by a different militia. Police are rarely seen, except when directing traffic, and there is no sign of the newly created national army.
The city has two main homegrown militias. One is led by Abdel Hakim Belhadj, an Islamist who spent time in Taliban camps in Afghanistan and now runs his militia from a luxury Tripoli hotel. The other is headed by Abdullah Naker, a former electronics engineer who is openly disdainful of Belhadj.
There are also the militias from outside town. Fighters from Zintan, an anti-Gaddafi bastion southwest of the capital, control the international airport.
Militias from the city of Misurata, east of Tripoli, have mostly withdrawn from central Tripoli but keep a presence in the eastern outskirts. Fighters from the Berber, or Amazigh, ethnic minority mark out their territory with their blue, green and yellow flags.
Another set of fighters from the east of Libya, the original heartland of the anti-Gaddafi revolt, add to the mix.

Activists accuse Syria of working to trick monitors

DATELINE: BEIRUT

BEIRUT - Activists accused the Syrian government Wednesday of misleading Arab League observers by taking them to areas loyal to the government, changing street signs to confuse them and sending supporters into rebellious neighborhoods to give false testimony. 
The month-long observer mission, which started Dec. 27, offers a rare glimpse into a country where a government crackdown on a nine-month-old uprising has killed more than 5,000 people. But fears persist that loyalists of President Bashar al-Assad have corrupted the observer process beyond repair.
The Arab League had no immediate comment, but Syrian Foreign Ministry spokesman Jihad Makdissi denied the allegations.
"We don't interfere in the mission's job," Makdissi said, adding that government escorts are necessary to protect the observers.
Activists said government loyalists are painting military vehicles blue to make them look like police vehicles, allowing the government to claim it has pulled the army out of heavily populated areas in accordance with an Arab League plan.
The plan requires the government to remove security forces and heavy weapons from city streets, start talks with opposition leaders and free political prisoners. Syria agreed to it on Dec. 19, clearing the way for the observers to enter.
But the Arab League has acknowledged that killings have continued. Activists put the death toll at more than 400 people since Dec. 21.
As the observers continued their work Wednesday, security forces and pro-government gunmen shot dead at least 12 people, nine of them in central Homs province, activist groups said.
The secretary general of the Arab League, Nabil Elaraby, told reporters in Cairo that the league will not cut short the observers' mission in Syria. An Arab diplomat had said Tuesday that the league would consider pulling out because of the continued killing.
"Our mission is important, and we made a commitment before the Syrian regime" to carry it out, Elaraby said.
Interviews with activists and eyewitnesses over the past week indicate clear signs of interference with the mission.
"The observers are going to areas known to be loyal to the regime," said Rami Abdulrahman, head of the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
A resident of Homs, one of the centers of opposition, said buses carrying dozens of government supporters arrived in his neighborhood of Khaldiyeh last week shortly before the observers arrived. The crowds pretended they lived there and gave testimonials to the observers, the resident said.

Drug Trafficking

Kingpin pleads guilty, avoids trial 
Mexican drug kingpin Benjamin Arellano Felix has pleaded guilty in U.S. federal court in San Diego to racketeering and conspiracy to launder money.
The plea Wednesday avoids a trial for one of the world's most powerful drug lords of the 1990s. 
The plea agreement calls for a maximum of 25 years in prison.
Arellano Felix headed a once-mighty cartel based in the border city of Tijuana. He was extradited from Mexico in April to face drug, money-laundering and racketeering charges.

Bishop steps down, admits being parent
A Roman Catholic auxiliary bishop from Los Angeles has resigned after admitting he is the father of two teenage children.
The Vatican announced Wednesday that Pope Benedict XVI had accepted the resignation of Auxiliary Bishop Gabino Zavala, 60, who was born in Mexico and grew up in Los Angeles.
Ordained in 1977 and named a bishop in 1994, Zavala developed a reputation for fighting for immigrants and the poor.
Los Angeles Archbishop Jose Gomez said in a letter that Zavala told him in December that he is the father of two teenage children, both minors, who live with their mother in another state.
Assuming the children are 17 or younger, they would have been born after Zavala had been appointed bishop.

House Democrats to continue boycott
Indiana's House Democratic leader said Wednesday that party lawmakers will stay out of the chamber until certain demands are met over a Republican right-to-work bill that was blocked last year by their boycott.
House Democratic Leader Patrick Bauer says lawmakers want more public hearings on the bill. 
Most Indiana House Democrats had been no-shows on the floor when the Republican speaker tried to start the session.
The Democrats' absence left the House short of the two-thirds of members needed to continue.
The bill would bar businesses and unions from mandating that workers pay union fees for representation. If passed, it would be the first right-to-work law enacted since 2001 in Oklahoma.

Deploying what appears to be a remarkable and perhaps even inspired evolution of bandit disguises, a man robbed a CVS on Christmas Eve with his face heavily bandaged and his arm dangling in a sling, Montgomery County police say. 
I'm calling him the Mummy Robber With a Bum Arm.
The Mummy Robber With a Bum Arm strolled into a Montgomery Village CVS about  8:45 p.m., according to police. I have seen injured people wandering around CVS before but never with head injuries so severe that I could barely see their eyes.
To me, it looks from the surveillance photo like the Mummy Robber With a Bum Arm required more specialized care than CVS typically offers, but I am not a doctor.
Anyway, with his healthy arm, the Mummy Robber With a Bum Arm slipped a note to the pharmacy staff informing it that he had a gun, according to police. He demanded drugs. The pharmacy staff did not put up a fight despite the robber's wounds. (Never tussle with a robber, no matter how silly his  disguise.)
Thankfully, none of the victims in the transaction suffered any injuries - real or fake - other than being rightfully scared and perhaps miffed. 
After procuring his Christmas Eve loot, the Mummy Robber With a Bum Arm bolted out the front door in an unknown direction. Now, Montgomery  police have released a surveillance photo of him, hoping someone will recognize him behind the gauze.
Police say he is between 6 feet and 6 feet 3 inches tall. He weighs between 200 and 230 pounds. 
I suspect the Mummy Robber With a Bum Arm's disguise will make him difficult to catch, even if the picture goes viral - and I assume it will. You just don't see bandaged robbers every day.

MARYLAND

Former Pr. George's candidate sentenced
A man who ran unsuccessfully for a seat on the Prince George's County Council in 2010 pleaded guilty Wednesday to using campaign money on personal expenses such as gas, groceries and auto repairs, authorities said. 
Darrell Miller, 47, the former mayor of Capitol Heights, was fined $2,000 and sentenced to 300 hours of community service as part of the plea agreement, in which he admitted violating election law during his 2010 council run, according to a news release from the Office of the Maryland State Prosecutor. He was also sentenced to two years of supervised probation, according to the release.
According to the state prosecutor's office, Miller violated two facets of election law during his campaign between July 1 and Nov. 15, 2010. First, Miller served as chairman of his own election committee and paid out money from the committee's account, "Friends of Darrell A. Miller." An election committee chairman who is also running for office is expressly prohibited from disbursing money, as that function is usually reserved for the committee's treasurer, said Deputy State Prosecutor Mike McDonough.
Second, Miller used campaign money to cover several small personal expenses unrelated to his election bid - such as hotel meals, car repairs, gas and groceries, McDonough said. He said in total, Miller spent $1,054 of campaign money on personal expenses. 
William C. Brennan, Miller's defense attorney, did not immediately return a phone message seeking comment. Miller was convicted and sentenced in Anne Arundel County Circuit Court.

VIRGINIA

Transportation group fights merger
The Northern Virginia Transportation Commission (NVTC), a group of 19 local and state elected officials plus the state's public transportation director, is fighting efforts by Gov. Robert F. McDonnell (R) to merge it with another group. 
The issue is likely to be a topic of discussion during an NVTC meeting Thursday. Virginia Secretary of Transportation Sean Connaughton has proposed consolidating the NVTC with the Northern Virginia Transportation Authority (NVTA).
The state withheld millions from the NVTC last year in a dispute over representation on local transit boards. The funds were released after the NVTC agreed to a revised contract granting the state some additional representation.
According to materials from NVTC, the merger would "create a singular, unified group to represent Northern Virginia's localities on transportation issues."
NVTC also appoints four members to serve on Metro's board of directors and would retain that power.
NVTC, which has eight full-time and part-time staffers and a $1.2 million annual budget, argues the two groups "serve divergent geographic regions with significantly different missions and areas of focus."

World War II Army private awarded Medal of Honor

BYLINE: T. Rees Shapiro

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B06

LENGTH: 566 words

Mike Colalillo, who was awarded the Medal of Honor for an extraordinary machine gun assault on German soldiers toward the end of World War II that inflicted 25 enemy casualties, died Dec. 30 at a nursing facility in Duluth, Minn. He was 86.
He had congestive heart failure, said his son, Al Colalillo. 
On April 7, 1945, Mr. Colalillo was a 19-year-old Army private first class on a patrol outside Untergriesheim, Germany, when his unit came under a barrage of enemy fire.
Pinned down by German machine guns and artillery, Mr. Colalillo turned to his fellow soldiers and told them to follow his lead. Inspired by his confidence, the soldiers "advanced in the face of savage enemy fire," according to his citation for the Medal of Honor, the military's highest award for valor.
Mr. Colalillo surged toward the Germans, firing his submachine gun until it was knocked from his hands by shrapnel. He then ran toward an American tank to take control of a machine gun mounted above its cannon turret.
Bullets clanged off the tank's armor and zipped by his body as Mr. Colalillo delivered his own withering response to the German onslaught.
"It was a rough time, and I was scared," Mr. Colalillo told the St. Paul Pioneer Press in 2004, "but I had to do what I had to do."
Mr. Colalillo blasted at one enemy position "with such devastating accuracy," the Medal of Honor citation read, that he killed or wounded at least 10 German soldiers and silenced a machine gun nest.
He continued his counterattack, directing his fire toward other German positions, killing another three Germans and destroying another machine gun position.After his gun jammed, Mr. Colalillo dismounted from the tank and grabbed a submachine gun to continue his assault on foot. According to the Medal of Honor citation, he killed or wounded 25 enemy soldiers.
When ordered to withdraw, Mr. Colalillo stayed behind to carry a wounded soldier over his shoulder through open terrain while artillery and mortar rounds pulverized the ground around him.
A few weeks later, he was approached by two military police officers who escorted him to a nearby headquarters. He recalled later that he thought he was under arrest. He was informed that the tank's commander had nominated him for the Medal of Honor, which he received in December 1945 at a White House ceremony.
Mr. Colalillo said his boyhood friends in Minnesota were surprised by the award and told him, "How could a little twerp like you get the Medal of Honor?"
Michael Colalillo was born Dec. 1, 1925, in Hibbing, Minn., and grew up in West Duluth. His parents were Italian immigrants and had nine children. 
After his mother died, he dropped out of school at 16 to support the family. He worked in a bakery where he said he "did everything from cleaning pans to putting jelly in the Bismarcks," a type of pastry.
After his military service, Mr. Colalillo worked for an ironworks and was seriously injured on the job when one of his arms got caught in a conveyor belt. He never fully recovered. He later was a foreman at a warehouse near the Duluth harbor and retired in the late 1980s.
His wife of 61 years, Lina Nissila Colalillo, died in 2007. Their daughter Joanne Colalillo died in 2001. 
Survivors include two children, Al Colalillo of Hayward, Wis., and Michele Schneeberger of Meadowlands, Minn.; a brother; two sisters; two grandsons; and three great-grandchildren.

7 players to watch in Richmond

BYLINE: Anita Kumar;Laura Vozzella

SECTION: METRO; Pg. T14

LENGTH: 1054 words

DATELINE: RICHMOND

RICHMOND - The Virginia General Assemblyreturns next week for a 60-day session to consider thousands of bills and pass a two-year state budget. After November's elections, Republicans secured tenuous control of the state Senate and a commanding majority in the House of Delegates. It is only the second time since the Civil War that the Republican Party has had control of both chambers and the governor's mansion.
1The session marks the most criticalfor Gov. Robert F. McDonnell (R), who is asking legislators to pass his first budget and approve priorities that include job creation, pension reform and K-12 education. 
The governor has worked across the aisle during his first two years in office, on issues such as transportationandhigher education. But in his first two sessions, he was frustrated by a Democratic-controlled Senate that killed proposals to expand the number of charter schools and divert existing money to ease traffic congestion.
With a Republican majority, his chances improve for getting his priorities passed, although it could also lead to a politically sensitive environment for him as the larger conservative wing of his party might want him to take on hot-button issuesthat he has largely avoided.
Other key figures to watch when legislators return Wednesday: 

2 Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling
 The Republican lieutenant governor, who has the tie-breaking vote in the Senate, should have _blankgreater power and visibilitynow that the chamber is evenly split between Republicans and Democrats. His state position officially remains a part-time one. (Bolling, 54, _blankhas a second job as an insurance company executive.) But even before the 20-20 Senate split, Bolling was doing more than the ceremonial duties usually associated with lieutenant governors. McDonnell made him a member of his Cabinet and designated him the state's chief jobs creation officer. With McDonnell's support, Bolling is running to succeed the governor in 2013. But first he'll have to get by _blankAttorney General Ken Cuccinelli IIin a Republican primary. Watch for him to try to make the most of his time in the tie-breaking spotlight, even as Democrats plan to challenge his authority on certain matters.

3Sen. Thomas K. Norment Jr.
 The moderate James City Republican was just _blankreelected as his party's leader in the Senate, despite talk before the elections that he might be replaced with someone more conservative. Democrats dispute that Republicans have control of the chamber, but Norment's party declared him majority leader, giving him the power to make committee assignments and decide which bills come to the floor for a vote. Having served two decades in the Senate, Norment, 65, sits on the powerful Finance Committee. He also works as a lawyer at Kaufman & Canoles and as a professor at the College of William and Mary. Norment is known around the Capitol for his vibrantly colored shirts and ties, folksy stories and _blankquirky voice mail greetings.

4House Minority Leader David J. Toscano
The Charlottesville Democrat was chosen to lead his party's caucus in the House after its leader, Ward L. Armstrong, lost his reelection bid when Republicans eliminated his districtduring redistricting. Several Democrats were interested in the post, but Toscano, 61, quickly emerged as the consensus candidatein part because of his calm demeanor on the House floor. He was elected unanimouslyby his peers last month. Toscano, a lawyer, former mayor and City Council member, has represented Charlottesville and Albemarle County in the House since 2006. He and and his fellow Democrats face a challenge this session. In the 100-member House, Republicans now hold a hefty 68-seat majority, the highest in Virginia history.

5Sen. Dick Black
The new senator from Loudoun County represents a new crop of Republican candidates elected to the General Assembly this year. Like Black, they are social conservatives who focused on creating jobs during the campaign but are expected to revive legislation on abortion, guns and immigration that died in the Democratic-led Senate in the past. A lawyer, Black, 67, was one of the most conservative members of the House, serving for eight years until he was defeated in 2005. He is probably best known for sending plastic pink models of fetuses to lawmakers as they prepared to vote on an abortion bill. Black easily won his Republican-leaning district in Loudoun and Prince William counties - one of two new districts in the statehttp://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/northern-virginia-builds-political-clout/2011/08/10/gIQAaZX9SJ_story.html - after the 2010 Census showed a spike in population in Northern Virginia's outer suburbs.

6Del. Lacey E. Putney
The 83-year-old independent from Bedford is the longest-serving member of the Virginia General Assembly. As chairman of the powerful House Appropriations Committee, he is the sponsor of his chamber's version of the budget and a key player in negotiating the differences between the spending plans of the House and Senate.Putney, a lawyer elected as a Democrat who supported school segregation in 1962, represents Bedford City and Bedford and Botetourt counties. He left the party five years later and joined the Republican caucus as an independent in 1998. He briefly served as speaker in 2002 after House Speaker S. Vance Wilkins Jr. resigned, following revelations that he had paid a staff member to keep quiet about "unwanted sexual advances.'' In 2007, Speaker William J. Howell (R-Stafford) tapped Putneyto lead the Appropriations Committee, though the move was a bit controversial because he is not a Republican. 

7Sen. Richard L. Saslaw
 The 71-year-old Democrat from Fairfax County has been in the Senate since 1980 and rose to majority leader four years ago, when Democrats took over the chamber. He has continued to use the majority leader title even after November's elections as he and other Democrats have maintained that Bolling's voting authority is limited and that Republicans won't have full control of the Senate. Saslaw, a _blankblunt-talking gas station magnatewho jogs to stay fit, ridiculed some republican candidates last fall as "_blanknut jobs." But he often joins Republicans to support the interests of developers and big business, including payday lenders.

Major initiatives fill council's agenda

BYLINE: Tim Craig

SECTION: METRO; Pg. T14

LENGTH: 857 words

D.C. leaders plan to overhaul taxicab regulations, explore ways to clean the environment and revamp services for at-risk youths this year, as they seek to rebound from a string of distractions last year.
After a brief holiday break, the D.C. Council was scheduled to return for its first legislation Wednesday to start work on a host of major initiatives. 
In the next 12 months, the council could reexamine the city's recycling law, consider new job training and economic development tools and rewrite contracting rules. Mayor Vincent C. Gray (D) and council Chairman Kwame R. Brown (D) will also work on the fiscal 2013 budget, which might require $106 million in spending cuts or new revenues.  
The year's legislative work will coincide with the 2012 elections, when half of the body is up for reelection. Members Vincent B. Orange (D-At Large), Muriel Bowser (D-Ward 4), Jack Evans (D-Ward 2), Yvette M. Alexander (D-Ward 7) and Marion Barry (D-Ward 8) are seeking reelection in the April 3 Democratic primary. The general election, when Michael A. Brown (I-At Large) will also appear on the ballot, will be Nov. 6.
Although the council approved a 200-page ethics reform bill Dec. 20, the topic is likely to remain a major source of debate in this year's elections. Adding to the uncertainty, the city's political climate remains clouded by several open federal investigations.
Last month, the FBI and IRS raided the home of council member Harry Thomas Jr. (D-Ward 5) after allegations by D.C. Attorney General Irvin B. Nathan that he had diverted $300,000 in city money for his personal use.
The U.S. attorney's office is also investigating whether money was properly accounted for in Brown's 2008 reelection campaign. Allegations about Gray's campaign and his administration's hiring practices are also under federal investigation.
Thomas, Brown and Gray have denied wrongdoing and have stressed that the federal probes will not interfere with their work.
The month is expected to begin with a debate between Gray and Brown over how to spend a projected $42 million surplus in the current fiscal year.
 The money was discovered because of higher than expected tax revenues. Brown wants to use it to shore up the city's reserve account or carry it over to partially offset a predicted shortfall in the fiscal 2013 budget.
But in a Dec. 23 letter, Gray told Brown he wants the money for some priorities in the current year's budget, including a $21 million gap in the D.C. public schools budget.
The tenor of that debate will set the stage for a broader discussion in the spring about whether the city will have to make additional budget cuts.
Administration officials and council members hope the stable local economy will translate into a brighter fiscal picture than Chief Financial Officer Natwar M. Gandhi's initial estimates of a $106 million shortfall in fiscal 2013.
But council member Jim Graham (D-Ward 1), chairman of the Human Services Committee, said he is bracing to try to fight against additional cuts to social service programs. "I suspect there will be a struggle," Graham said.
Council members are also preparing for an intense citywide debate over a proposal to overhaul the taxicab industryand mandate fuel-efficient vehicles.
Last month, Gray and fellow council members Mary M. Cheh (D-Ward 3) and Tommy Wells (D-Ward 6) introduced a proposal to set new training and environmental standards for the city's 5,000-plus taxicab fleet. The legislation mandates credit-card payment options, satellite navigation systems and a single paint color for the city's cabs.
To pay for the improvements, the District might assess a 50-cent surcharge on passengers. The taxicab industry could try to derail partsof the proposal.
Brown is also expected to spend the year continuing his efforts to bolster public education, particularly middle schools. On Jan. 23, Brown will oversee a hearing on his Highly Effective Teacher Incentive Act, which seeks to broaden incentives available to teachers who choose to work in low-income and underperforming schools.
D.C. Council member David A. Catania (I-At Large) intends to complete work on his legislation to revamp in the city's youth behavioral health system in the aftermath of the March 2010 South Capitol Street shootings thatleft four teenagers dead.
"It's been a massive undertaking," Catania said. "We have a lot of unmet behavioral health needs in our city as a result of poverty, as a result of substance abuse. This is aimed at getting a hold of these children when they first show signs of behavioral problems."
The council could also consider legislation by Bowser to reexamine city procedures for doling out hundreds of millions in contracts each year. Bowser aims to make the process simpler and more transparent, and to implement more anti-fraud safeguards.
Several environmental initiatives, including changes to the city's recycling law and new tools to help promote urban farming, are also expected to appear on the council's agenda this year.

THE REGION

Metro track work to affect all 5 rail lines
Here's the plan for Metrorail service adjustments, starting at 10 p.m. Friday and continuing through the trains system's midnight closing Sunday. 
Red Line: Trains will share tracks between Dupont Circle and Friendship Heights and between Takoma and Forest Glen. They will leave the ends of the line at Shady Grove and Glenmont every half-hour throughout the weekend. But between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. Saturday and Sunday, extra trains will operate between Fort Totten and Farragut North.
Blue/Orange lines: Trains will share a track between Smithsonian and Eastern Market. They will leave the ends of the lines about every 26 minutes. Through the inner part of the train system, where these two lines join, trains should arrive at platforms about every 13 minutes. 
Green Line: Trains will share tracks between Georgia Avenue and Fort Totten and between Naylor Road and Branch Avenue. They will leave the ends of the line about every 15 minutes.
Yellow Line: Trains will operate every 15 minutes to align schedules with Green Line trains, which share a tunnel through the District.

Another crack delays riders on Metro
A crack in a switch near the Stadium-Armory Metro station caused delays Thursday afternoon for Metro riders. 
The problem in the switch, known as a frog, was discovered about 1:30 p.m. by crews inspecting the aerial track east of the station, said Metro spokesman Dan Stessel. He said the crack may have been weather-related. 
Crews finished replacing the switch, which allows trains to divert from one track to another, shortly after 6 p.m. 
On Wednesday, cracks on the Red and Yellow lines delayed the morning commute.

Prince William County police identified three officers involved in the fatal shooting in Decemberof an armed burglary suspect who fled from police and refused to drop his weapon.
Officers Nicholas Colella, Brandon Fields and Christopher Moore fired on Jabril Eli Mitchell, 21, who was being sought in connection with an armed burglary earlier in the day. The three officers, who were on patrol and were called to the scene, were placed on administrative leave after the incident and are now back at work, Police Chief Charlie T.

Wizards hold players meeting

BYLINE: Gene Wang

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. D04

Mired in the worst start in franchise history, the Washington Wizards held a players-only meeting on Thursday afternoon in which they addressed myriad issues that have left them the only team in the NBA without a victory.
Veteran guard-forward Maurice Evans organized the meeting that took place between a film session and practice at Verizon Center one day after the Wizards lost to Orlando, 103-85, to drop to 0-6. The meeting lasted 15 to 20 minutes, according to forward Andray Blatche, who invited criticism following aseason-opening 90-84 loss to New Jersey in which he called for the ball in the post after the team blew a 21-point lead at home.
"The sense of entitlement that's here sometimes, I've never seen before," said Evans, who came to Washington last year in a trade with Atlanta. "We have to start earning things. Earn your way into the rotation. Earn your way onto the floor, and then you earn your minutes by being productive, and when you're not in the rotation, you be supportive and make guys better in practice." 
Evans has yet to play this season because of discomfort in his right knee. Still, he remains among the most respected players in the locker room as a veteran who has been on playoff teams and as a vice president of the players' union.
Blatche pointed to Evans, Roger Mason Jr. and Rashard Lewis as teammates whose messages resonated the most. Like Evans, Mason and Lewis have played with contenders for parts of their careers, and their leadership has become that much more necessary as Washington tries to extricate itself from a culture of losing that has continued despite preseason optimism.
At the top of the discussion list during the meeting, players said, was delineating roles on a team on which no player, including 2010 No. 1 pick John Wall, has distinguished himself. Wall is averaging 13.8 points per game, second on the Wizards, but is shooting 33 percent - second lowest on the team. He's also averaging 3.7 turnovers per game.
Among the starters, only center JaVale McGee is shooting above 38 percent. McGee is averaging 12.5 points per game and is the third-leading scorer. Blatche, meanwhile, is averaging 12 points per game and went 2 for 13 in a 101-83 loss to Atlanta one game after he told reporters he should be more involved in the offense in the low post.
"We're just trying to hold ourselves accountable," Blatche said. "A lot of guys say, 'This is the reason, that's the reason' [for the losing streak]. Mo brought us together and said, 'The reason is us.' We've got nobody to blame but ourselves. At the end of the day, we're the players out there. There's nobody else playing but us, so we all had a good talk. We all said our piece, and hopefully all the guys took it in and didn't take it" personally.
Blatche was referring especially to the rookies and his younger teammates. The Wizards have seven players 23 years or younger, including rookies Jan Vesely, the No. 6 overall pick in this year's draft, Chris Singleton and Shelvin Mack. Jordan Crawford, 23, was among the most despondent players in the locker room following Wednesday's loss to the Magic, which put on an exhibition of team basketball the Wizards would be delighted to match.
Crawford said the atmosphere was "dead" and he felt as if the Wizards had been playing for months rather than two weeks. Lewis, who played for Orlando for more than three seasons before being traded to Washington for Gilbert Arenas, said the team took "five steps back."
Coach Flip Saunders echoed that evaluation in the postgame news conference, and on Thursday he mentioned that he has coached winning teams that have conducted players-only meetings.
"As you become a playoff team and a good team, players also have to hold themselves accountable on the floor because we only have so many timeouts that we can call," said Saunders, who coached regular playoff participants in Minnesota and Detroit. "So a lot of times things happen out there, and the players have to communicate to themselves. 
"What accountability does is it increases the trust level that players have with each other, and usually when you're struggling, it's because it's a lack of trust at times, and so you worry more about what you have to do than about what the team has to do. I think more than anything else, [the meeting] was just an emphasis that we're going to hold each other accountable, that we're a team, we're family."

Widow hailed as hero for killing intruder
Some might call it a case of swift Oklahoma justice for at least one of two intruders - both reportedly high on prescription drugs - who tried to break into a widow's home on New Year's Eve.
Sarah McKinley, 18, calmly used a shotgun to shoot and kill one of the men when he forced his way through the front door of her mobile home in Grady County. Now, the second man is facing first-degree murder charges for his role in a first-degree burglary in which a death resulted, and McKinley is being hailed as a hero for doing what she believed she had to do to protect herself and her 3-month-old son, Justin.
The men were reportedly looking for drugs - probably painkillers - that they believed belonged to McKinley's husband, who died of lung cancer on Christmas.
McKinley will not face charges in the case, which is garnering headlines around the world. Her ordeal was captured in a recorded 911 call in which she asked for help and permission to shoot if necessary.

The collection was appraised in 2007 at $189 million, including myriad items plucked by remote-controlled probes from the wreck, 2ֲ½ miles below the ocean's surfaceDog survives avalanche: A dog that was feared dead after a weekend avalanche killed its owner showed up exhausted and hungry four days later at the Montana motel where its owners had stayed before going skiing. The Billings Gazette reports that the proprietor of the Alpine Motel spotted the Welsh corgi on Wednesday, sitting outside the room that Dave and Kerry Gaillard had rented. A rescue crew member said the dog was in good condition, despite traveling four miles.

A Hokie's broken heart

DATELINE: BLACKSBURG, VA.

BLACKSBURG, Va. - Last month,Allan Chaney spent the better part of an hour trying to prove why he should be allowed to play college basketball again. He talked of pickup games he had played - against doctors' orders - at a Virginia Tech rec center. He said he had recovered from surgeries that left one scar on the side of his ribcage and two more on his chest.
"How about this? This is what I'm down to," Chaney said. "You don't have to let me play in the games. Just let me practice. Let me practice with the team so I can help. I can help in practice."
On April 21, 2010, Allan Chaney collapsed and lost consciousness while completing drills on the Virginia Tech practice floor. Over the next year, he visited specialists up and down the East Coast, some of whom said his basketball career might be over. This past August, Virginia Tech's sports medicine department announced it would never allow Chaney to practice or compete with the school's basketball team because of complications from viral myocarditis, an infection of the heart that causes inflammation and, in some cases, can be fatal. 
That didn't deter Chaney: In early November, he had a new type of defibrilator implanted, one that recognizes irregular heartbeats and shocks the heart back to normal. But even the University of Pennsylvania cardiologist who oversaw the procedure can't be 100 percent certain Chaney's heart won't falter again.
For Chaney, though, this journey isn't about risking his life. Hellbent on becoming the only person in the country to play Division I basketball with a defibrillator in his chest, this is his life.
 "It hurts bad because I'm so close but this far away," Chaney said. "I think right now with somebody actually coaching me and working me out, I'm ready to go play professional with men. But I want to play in college. I just hope somebody will give me a chance."

'I cried a little bit'
 Since transferring to Virginia Tech from Florida in May 2009, Chaney had wowed his new teammates in practice (NCAA transfer rules prevented him from playing in games). Coach Seth Greenberg was convinced that the 6-foot-9 forward "had a chance to become a first-round pick" in the NBA draft. 
But about 45 minutes into that fateful April offseason workout, Chaney stepped to the free throw line and "couldn't breathe." At first he thought it was just from being out of shape. But when Chaney couldn't catch his breath, he walked over to the sideline and sat down.
A manager asked if he wanted some water, and Chaney's last memory is responding,  "Yes." Chaney then fell from his chair with the ball still in his hands, and "someone told me I was making noises even though I was passed out."
Trainer Amy Kunigonis administered CPR to revive Chaney, and doctors initially thought it was simply a case of severe dehydration. But following a day of cardiac tests, they determined Chaney had viral myocarditis. 
"But to me, I felt okay," Chaney said. "I didn't think that I had a problem because I didn't have any symptoms. I wasn't feeling sluggish and down."
Itching to play basketball again while home in Baltimore in August 2010, Chaney went to a local YMCA to play a pickup game. But he passed out again.
Other than some light shooting with the team, Chaney didn't play basketball again for more than a year as his heart healed. Periodic visits to a heart specialist at the University of Virginia revealed he needed an ablation procedure to remove scar tissue and to prevent future inflammation. But the doctors in Charlottesville couldn't guarantee Chaney wouldn't experience any more irregular heartbeats. 
December 2010 brought more bad news. Chaney traveled to Boston and met with renowned cardiologist Mark Estes, a member of the "Dream Team" that consulted on the case of former Boston Celtics guard Reggie Lewis before he died from sudden cardiac arrest on the practice floor because of scarring caused by a virus in his heart. 
Estes said no doctor would ever medically clear Chaney to play basketball again. 
"I took it like, 'Damn, he's telling me it's a wrap,' " Chaney said. "I cried a little bit. I was upset. But afterwards, I figured there's gonna be ways around it. Technology is crazy."

'We were all optimistic'
When Francis Marchlinski first met with Chaney in his office outside Philadelphia in early 2011, he said he never would be 100 percent certain Chaney wouldn't suffer another cardiac episode. But he did mention a new kind of defibrillator developed in Europe, one that would be less subject to wear and tear during an extreme physical activity like playing college basketball. 
Marchlinski, a cardiologist based at the University of Pennsylvania, gave Chaney hope, telling him "I can get you back to where you can play, where you can get to your normal life," Chaney recalled.
So last May, Marchlinski performed an ablation procedure on Chaney, because at that point he was still "at an incredibly high risk of having rhythm abnormalities that could not only cause him to pass out but could clearly end his life," Marchlinski said last month.
In July, with no complications from the ablation, Marchlinski met with Chaney; his father, Arthur; Greenberg; Mark Rogers, Virginia Tech's team physician; and team trainer Dave Dietter in Philadelphia. Marchlinski laid out his plan for Chaney, how a backup defibrillator would need to be implanted just in case the ablation didn't hold. But if everything went right, Marchlinski indicated he could one day grant Chaney medical clearance to play basketball again.
Chaney distinctly remembers Rogers asking Marchlinski, "If Allan gets this defibrillator today, will you clear him to play?" Chaney says Marchlinski responded in the affirmative. After talking more with Rogers, Chaney left that meeting feeling as if his career had been resurrected, that "it's over a 70 percent chance I could be cleared or I could have a chance to prove that I'm okay," he said.
"We were all optimistic and noticeably, collectively happy," said Arthur Chaney, a Philadelphia firefighter.
But on Aug. 10, Virginia Tech's sports medicine department made its ruling.  Rogers has offered no other explanation to Chaney or his family, and did not return several messages seeking additional comment for this story. Greenberg said he has "nothing to do with medical decisions." 
"It's easier for the team to be more conservative, and I don't blame them," said Marchlinski, who hasn't yet cleared Chaney to play. "Nobody wants anything to happen, and no one wants anything to happen on their watch. There's nothing about this defibrillator that makes it different than any defibrillator and that's why everyone does soul-searching."
Greenberg kept Chaney on scholarship even though his playing career in Blacksburg was over. But Chaney says the timing of the school's decision left him in a bind: When he spoke with Temple Coach Fran Dunphy about transferring there to be closer to Marchlinski, all of the Owls' roster spots were filled. Chaney now feels misled by Rogers and Virginia Tech's sports medicine department.
"For them to turn me down a week before school starts in August, it's kind of like you already knew you weren't gonna clear me. You should have told me that back in July or June," Chaney said. "It's nothing against them, but they put me in a bad place."

'Uncharted waters'
To the naked eye, there is nothing wrong with Chaney. He still looks like the 6-9 specimen with the 38-inch vertical jump and silky-smooth jump shot who showed up uninvited to a recruiting showcase in Philadelphia during the summer of 2007 and became a top recruit overnight because of his performance.
Before getting his defibrillator in November, Chaney spent many fall afternoons playing pickup basketball on campus for the first time since his initial collapse in April 2010. He dunked and ran the floor, albeit against inferior competition and without the knowledge of his doctors. 
Chaney says he encountered no problems and plans to remain in Blacksburg through the summer, when he's scheduled to earn his degree in apparel, housing and resource management. He still sits on the bench during most Virginia Tech men's basketball games. He would be a redshirt junior this year.
"He's a special talent, but my biggest thing is his long-term well-being, for him to have a long and prosperous and fulfilling life. I don't know if he can have that without at least knowing he can play or not," Greenberg said. "The problem for whatever school is the risk-management side of the university is absolutely going to have to clear him. When you hurt your ACL, you know it's going to be about a year. But dealing with Allan, this is such uncharted waters for all of us."
Brenda Pletcher, Chaney's mother, gets emotional now that this unfortunate journey has reached 20 months, especially as she ponders the question of whether the youngest of her three sons will ever get another chance to prove what his heart is made of these days.
"I feel like he's been let down. Just like Allan has been courageous throughout the whole deal, I feel that some of the people that made this decision for him, that changed his life, they could've been a little more courageous. I just believe it takes people like that to beat the odds," she said. 
"Allan is 21 years old. Defibrillator or no defibrillator, he's going to be doing something out there that's going to cause him to exercise. I don't know what they're so afraid of. Why be afraid? It's like being afraid of living."

Kazakhstan quickly slaps a lid on dissent

DATELINE: MOSCOW

MOSCOW - Don't expect Moscow-style protests in Kazakhstan, the big Central Asian country on Russia's southwestern border, even though elections there are also approaching, the political system is similarly regulated and a violent conflict last month left at least 16 dead.
The party of President Nursultan Nazarbayev is expected to win the Jan. 15 parliamentary elections easily and by whatever percentage he desires, his critics say. And what exactly happened when striking oil workers were killed Dec. 16 in the western city of Zhanaozen remains unclear: This week, Nazarbayev extended the state of emergency there until the end of the month, limiting communication with the outside world. 
The state of politics and the public mood in Kazakhstan, a Muslim country of 16 million, are of interest to the United States. The U.S. government depends on Kazakhstan for supply routes to Afghanistan to the south and wants to cultivate democracy and friendship in a part of the world where Russia and China strive for influence. Money is at stake, too. U.S. companies have invested billions in the oil industry.
Nazarbayev has exercised tight control over the country since the Soviet days of 1989, when he was head of the Communist Party. He became Kazakhstan's first president after independence in 1991, and his admirers call him president for life. Human Rights Watch has described "an atmosphere of quiet repression" in Kazakhstan and has documented abuses. No chances are being taken now: On Friday, the nation's Constitutional Council said the election was canceled for Zhanaozen's 50,000 voters because of the state of emergency, under which demonstrations and the use of copying machines have been banned.
The violence erupted Dec. 16, when Kazakhs were celebrating the 20th anniversary of their independence from the Soviet Union. Striking oil workers - many of whom had been fired - had filled the main square of Zhanaozen for seven months, demanding raises. They complained that they had been impoverished by the high cost of living and were angry that the country's resources were so unevenly distributed. The country has five billionaires on the Forbes list, including a Nazarbayev daughter and son-in-law.
At first, local officials said police fired at the ground to disperse troublemakers who were interfering with the independence celebration. But soon videos on the Internet appeared to show police firing at fleeing crowds.
Nazarbayev quickly intervened. He fired several officials, including his billionaire son-in-law, Timur Kulibayev, who supervised the state oil company connected to the labor dispute. The country's prosecutor is investigating the police behavior, and applicationforms have been distributed to fired strikers so they can apply for new jobs.
"In Russia, one of the reasons for the unexpected protests was because the authorities were relaxed," said Grigory Golosov, an analyst speaking by phone from St. Petersburg on Thursday. "In Kazakhstan, they know that at least some of the people are not satisfied. Therefore, they will simply be more attentive to making the elections the way they want to have them."

'We will not have protests'
Golosov calls the system, developed in Russia and emulated in Kazakhstan, "electoral authoritarianism." In a break with traditional authoritarian countries, elections are held to give the regime legitimacy, but serious opponents are prevented from competing and ballots can be stuffed, said Golosov, a political science professor and project director at the Center for Democracy and Human Rights Helix. Widespread allegations of vote rigging set off protests in Russia after the Dec. 4 parliamentary elections.
In Kazakhstan, as in Russia, a party has to receive at least 7 percent of the vote to have any seats in parliament. In Kazakhstan's 2007 elections, Nazarbayev's Nur Otan party won 88 percent of the vote and every seat in parliament.
Yermukhamet Yertysbayev, Nazarbayev's political adviser, said in a telephone interview from Kazakhstan on Thursday that Nur Otan was not at all similar to Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's United Russia party in Moscow.
Various competing parties joined Nur Otan long ago, he said, giving it a monopoly on political talent and making it widely representative. "People support the president, and the president is the leader of the party," Yertysbayev said. "We will not have protests."
In these elections, he said, Nur Otan would not win every seat in parliament. After the last elections, the law was changed to give seats to the second-place party even if it did not receive 7 percent.
Golosov said Nur Otan would receive less than 88 percent this time because Nazarbayev was embarrassed internationally when overeager officials delivered such a huge proportion of the vote.
"This time the results will be more acceptable for the international community," he said. "I think Nazarbayev wanted some nominal opposition, and they will take care of it. But there will be no feeling of defeat for Nur Otan or massive dissatisfaction as in Russia."
Kazakhstan has a less-developed middle class than is found in Russia, where the young and educated led the protests. The Internet, on which vigorous political debate helped keep Russians informed, is more restricted in Kazakhstan. And regional officials remain extremely dependent on Nazarbayev, Golosov said.

Deadly shooting
Yertysbayev said the disorder in Zhanaozen was a provocation against the presidentthat will not affect the elections. The strike had been proceeding legally until criminals caused trouble Dec. 16, he said. "The president dealt with it, and the situation is back to normal," he said. "There will be a detailed criminal investigation."
A correspondent for Russia's Novaya Gazeta newspaper reported that 3,000 oil workers, relatives and onlookers were standing in the square when authorities brought groups of students and residents there for the celebration. The correspondent said witnesses told her that police fired on the crowd for 10 minutes and that nearly 70 people had died, a number difficult to verify because many relatives immediately took the dead home. After the shooting, she said, young people began setting buildings on fire.
If political change comes, Golosov said, "I don't expect it to come from elections. It would come if the president's health deteriorates or from discontent in western Kazakhstan."

Families settle Blackwater lawsuit 
Days after the last U.S. troops left Iraq, a court ended a lawsuit over an episode that produced one of the more disturbing images of the war: the killings of four Blackwater security contractors and the hanging of a pair of their bodies from a bridge in Fallujah. 
Victims' families reached a confidential settlement with the company's successor, Arlington-based Academi, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit dismissed the suit.
The deal ends some relatives' hopes that a trial would expose events that led to insurgents killing the contractors in 2004.
Survivors of the contractors contend Blackwater failed to prepare and equip the men adequately for their mission.

Verdict overturnedin Super Bowl threat 
A federal appeals court overturned the conviction Friday of an Arizona man who plotted to open fire on crowds at the 2008 Super Bowl in Tempe, Ariz.
A panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit found Kurt Havelock was not guilty of mailing threatening communications to an individual when he wrote to media organizations about his plan for the massacre.
Havelock, upset over being denied a liquor license, had bought a rifle and ammunition for the attack, the court opinion said.
On his way to the game, he sent six packages to the media threatening an attack. But Havelock then had a change of heart and turned himself in to police. 
A jury convicted Havelock of mailing threatening communications to a person. Havelock said he was not guilty because he mailed the letters to corporations, not individuals. A majority of the appeals court agreed.

NASA challenges sale of Apollo 13 list 
 NASA is questioning whether Apollo 13 commander James Lovell has the right to sell a 70-page checklist from the flight, which includes his handwritten calculations that helped guide the damaged craft back to Earth.
The document was sold by Heritage Auctions in November for more than $388,000. The checklist gained fame in the 1995 film "Apollo 13." The sale has been suspended pending the outcome of the inquiry.

Energy Dept. nixes loan for steel plant 
The U.S. Energy Department won't follow through on a planned $730 million loan to an arm of one of Russia's largest steel companies to modernize its Detroit-area plant.
The Detroit News and Detroit Free Press reported Friday that the conditional loan for the Severstal North America project in Dearborn won't be finalized.
Spokeswoman Katya Pruett said Severstal was "deeply disappointed" and would review other financing options.
About 60 percent of the project has been completed, but the company was waiting on final loan approval to finish it.
The Energy Department didn't detail reasons for canceling the loan. Department spokesman Damien LaVera said that the project has "merit" but that not all projects that get conditional commitments are green-lighted.
The conditional approval was criticized by some Republican lawmakers. Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) compared the loan to the government's $528 million loan to solar panel maker Solyndra, which filed for bankruptcy court protection last year.

So far, no potholes on road for Hoyas

BYLINE: Gene Wang

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. D02

LENGTH: 577 words

The ninth-ranked Georgetown men's basketball team has encountered its share of road hostility this season, having played and won games at such demanding venues as Louisville's KFC Yum! Center and Alabama's Coleman Coliseum.
There also was the Hoyas' trip to China in August, when what was supposed to be a goodwill tour turned violent during an exhibition game in Beijing. The game included two benches-clearing altercations and ended with Coach John Thompson III pulling his staff and players off the court while having to dodge full bottles of water hurled by rowdy Chinese fans. 
Georgetown (13-1, 3-0 Big East) brings its program-record 11-game winning streak into a familiarly contentious arena on Saturday, and while the Hoyas have had a rough go of it recently at WVU Coliseum, their players are undeterred because of their trials overseas and stateside. Georgetown has lost four in a row against the Mountaineers (11-4, 2-1) and three of its past four at the Coliseum.
Thompson said repeatedly following the incident in China the experience would gird his players for inhospitable conditions, and so far he has proved prophetic. Georgetown beat Alabama in its first true road game of the season on Dec. 1, ending the Crimson Tide's 24-game home win streak. Last week they also dealt Louisville, then ranked No. 4, its first loss at home in 21 games.
The environment at West Virginia is among the most boisterous in the Big East, and at times spectators have overstepped the line between passionate and irresponsible. Last year, for instance, Mountaineers Coach Bob Huggins took to the microphone during a game against arch-rival Pittsburgh after fans tossed T-shirts and bottles onto the court.
The boorish behavior compelled university President James Clements to issue a statement the following day admonishing those who were at fault.
To top things off, beer sales are permitted at the Coliseum, where thousands of underage college students attend games. The school's board of governors in June approved the measure to allow beer to be sold at football and basketball games but included provisions such as no vendors in the student sections, a limit of two beers per sale and identification required regardless of age.
The Hoyas lost to West Virginia, 81-68, in their last visit there, in March 2010. They haven't won there since 2007-08, when Patrick Ewing Jr. blocked a shot in the closing seconds to preserve a 58-57 triumph.
The Hoyas are coming off a mettle-testing win against No. 20 Marquette on Wednesday in which they erased a 17-point second-half deficit and escaped, 73-70, at Verizon Center. The difference was junior Hollis Thompson's three-pointer from the left baseline that rattled around the rim and fell in with 24 seconds to play.
Georgetown shot 63 percent, including 76 percent in the second half, but nearly came undone because of 12 first-half turnovers and 57 percent shooting from the foul line overall. Still, with all their foibles, the Hoyas managed to climb back into the proceedings with defensive resolve and timely scoring.
"We joke about it, but most of the time we have a feeling when we're down that we're not going to lose the game," said senior guard Jason Clark, who scored a game-high 26 points on 9-of-14 shooting. "I think that's a really good confidence to have when you're down that you're going to win the game. I've got faith in my players, and they have faith in me that we're going to win the game."

Terror takes a trite turn in 'The Devil Inside'

BYLINE: Mark Jenkins

SECTION: STYLE; Pg. C04

LENGTH: 450 words

The premise of "The Devil Inside" is that supernatural evil is contagious. But, hey, we knew that. Look how the scourge of the phony-found-footage horror movie leaped from "The Blair Witch Project" to the "Paranormal Activity" series to this low-budget, low-concept, zero-plausibility flick. It's a pestilence of infectious claptrap. 
The story, directed and co-written by William Brent Bell, riffs on the Roman Catholic exorcism rite you may have seen in some other movie. So, naturally, most of the action is set in the shadow of the Vatican, not far from the tourist sites debased by "Angels and Demons." ("Devil" was shot in Romania, but that sounds a bit like Rome.) The actual terror begins in Anytown, U.S.A., where Maria Rossi (Suzan Crowley) brutally killed two priests and a nun. Seems they were trying to evict a demon.
Found not guilty by reason of insanity, Maria is sent to an asylum near the Tiber, perhaps because fresh pasta is good for schizophrenia. Twenty years later, Maria's now-grown daughter, Isabella (Fernanda Andrade), travels to Rome to visit her mom. Naturally, she's making a documentary about the trip, so she drags along a video guy, Michael (Ionut Grama). He doesn't have a big role in the story, but he's a heck of a cameraman; he gets every blurry, hand-held shot the movie needs, even ones that are technically impossible.
Isabella soon falls in with two young priests, Ben (Simon Quarterman) and David (Evan Helmuth), who are renegade exorcists. They tend to victims of demonic possession that their church superiors refuse to acknowledge, taking an oh-so-scientific approach to medieval superstition. They let Isabella and Michael videotape a dark-basement exorcism, during which a spiritually polluted young woman screams, levitates and contorts her limbs, to the accompaniment of loud, cracking noises that would make any vertebrate wince.
Naturally, the boys want to try their techniques on Maria. One problem, though: Sometimes a freshly exorcised fiend gloms onto an innocent bystander, turning him or her into a twisted, howling bag of hate. 
You can see where this is going, and the filmmakers can see that you can see. So they rush to the hideous yet hilarious climax in little more than an hour and then pad the running time with the slowest-moving credits ever. Even Satan, trapped for all eternity in his sulfurous kingdom, would probably get antsy watching them crawl - except for one thing, the name of the movie's contortionist: Pixie Le Knot. Good to know that someone has a sense of humor about this diabolical foolishness.

Giffords's next goal: Returning to work

BYLINE: Kevin Freking

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A03

LENGTH: 689 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON - The signals are strong. One year after being shot in the head, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords is on a mission to return to the job she so clearly loved.
Her husband and people near the three-term congresswoman say she is highly motivated to recover from her injuries and get back to work in Washington, potentially using her inspirational story as a way to mend political differences in the nation's capital. She faces a May deadline to get on the November ballot, meaning she has a few months to decide her next step.
The Arizona Democrat returned to Tucson on Friday from Houston to attend ceremonies planned to mark Sunday's one-year anniversary of the shooting that killed six and injured her and 12 others. 
Her first stop was her office, where she participated in an emotional ceremony to honor slain staffer Gabe Zimmerman. Her staff dedicated a life-size photo of Zimmerman and a memorial plaque that will greet visitors as they arrive. Events will take place throughout Sunday in Tucson, and Giffords is expected to attend at least one.
Giffords's staff consults with her when working on major initiatives, such as trying to fend off the Air Force's efforts to move the 612th Air and Space Operations Center out of Tucson. The staff also works on individual constituent requests, such as helping war veterans and their widows obtain benefits or in securing a Tucson woman's flight out of Egypt during demonstrations in early 2011. Aides say that Giffords now participates in teleconferences with members of her staff about once a week, though the call gets put off occasionally based on her schedule.
On Capitol Hill, colleagues have held several fundraisers on her potential campaign's behalf, raising more than $800,000 between Jan. 1 and Sept. 30, a number that will surely grow when a new quarterly report is filed later this month.
The lawmakers say they're optimistic that she'll come back, but are sensitive about getting ahead of Giffords.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Thursday that she called Giffords's husband, Mark Kelly, earlier in the day to emphasize that Democratic lawmakers were thinking of the congresswoman as the anniversary of the shooting approached.
"We look forward to welcoming her back, and hopefully that will be soon," Pelosi said.
Giffords speaks with Rep. Debbie Wasserman Shultz (Fla.) probably more than any other member of Congress. When asked about her colleague's return, the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee said Giffords was focused on her recovery for now.
"She's making a lot of progress. She's doing great," Wasserman Shultz said. "She still has a long way to go."
Giffords has until May 30 to file nominating signatures to have her name placed on the ballot for Arizona's 8th Congressional District. Kelly told Arizona Public Media that she won't wait until the last minute to make her decision, and he has suggested that she might wait until 2014 to mount her political comeback.
He said Giffords "is the exact same person" she was before the shooting and just has to learn how to communicate as well as she did before.
"She doesn't remember the day she was shot, but if you back up one day, her memory is as good as mine for anything we have done together over the last seven years that I have known her," he said.
Giffords represents a swing district with nearly equal percentages of Republican and Democratic voters. Potential Republican challengers are awaiting her decision before committing to the race. If she doesn't run, multiple candidates are expected to enter the fray. If she opts to run, there will be less enthusiasm on their part because they know Giffords would be a heavy favorite.
"It will be very difficult, but nothing is impossible," said Shane Wikfors, communications director for the Arizona Republican Party.
The difficulty of challenging Giffords transcends the issues. People are rooting for her regardless of political leanings, said Chuck Coughlin, a Republican strategist in Phoenix.
"She will forever have a very special place in all of Arizona's heart for the price she has paid for public service," he said.

D.C. leaders should learn honest lesson from Thomas case

BYLINE: Robert McCartney

SECTION: METRO; Pg. C01

LENGTH: 785 words

Tim Day remembers clearly when he found the "smoking gun" that now seems certain to send former D.C. Council member Harry Thomas Jr. (D) to federal prison.
It was in September 2010. Day, who was Thomas's Republican opponent for the Ward 5 council seat, was in bed.
"It was about 1 o'clock in the morning, and I was there with my laptop," Day recalled. He was poring over apparent irregularities in records of Thomas's purported charity work for youth sports programs. 
"One plus one didn't equal two, and it was driving me crazy," he said. "The 'aha' moment was when I realized that he had not bothered to attain [a] nonprofit status for his entity, Team Thomas."
That potentially made donations to the group illegal. It also helped explain what was really happening to about $300,000 contributed to the program.
"I realized, 'What's he doing? He's taking the money!' " Day said.
It's a nice story, with a satisfying ending for anybody who cares about honesty in government and holding politicians accountable.
On Friday, Thomas pleaded guiltyto two felonies connected to his theft of more than $350,000 of public funds for personal use, including golf vacations and a sport-utility vehicle. After more than a year of categorically denying that he'd done anything wrong, Thomas resigned and admitted that he broke the law for years in pretty much exactly the way Day figured out 16 months ago.
But the tale also offers two separate lessons, which are much less satisfying. It demonstrates the weakness of the D.C. government's internal accounting systems. And it highlights anew the tendency in much of the city's Democratic political establishment to ignore - or at least minimize - evidence of political corruption.
Day points out that a number of government watchdogs had missed chances to catch Thomas's crooked dealings.
"No one found that this money was misappropriated, but little old me was able to sit in front of my computer and find and track it all," Day said.
"The council, the Children [& Youth Investment] Trust, the auditor and [Chief Financial Officer Natwar M.] Gandhi's office all failed to do their job. That is a systemic failure," he said.
In the end, Thomas was convicted because D.C. Attorney General Irvin B. Nathan and the U.S. attorney's office were persuaded by Day's work.
Former U.S. prosecutor Joseph E. diGenova said the case was "handed to the U.S. attorney on a silver platter."
If the legal authorities were impressed, however, the politicians stayed mostly mum. There was little outrage at the top when Day first went public with his findings, even though he outlined them in detail in a 27-slide PowerPoint presentation.
"It's a well-known fact that in D.C. we allow suspicious behavior, and we don't come forward," Day said. "We have to break the mentality in this city that it's okay for bad things to happen."
From the beginning, Democratic bosses in Ward 5 and elsewhere dismissed the allegations as a Republican smear campaign. When this newspaper's editorial page pounded Thomas for failing to explain the anomalies, the criticism was written off as a news media vendetta.
Even when Thomas agreed to repay $300,000 to the District to settle a civil suit by Nathan's office and the case was referred to the U.S. attorney's office for criminal investigation, only three of the 12 other D.C. Council members called for Thomas's resignation.
Day said he believed that ordinary residents are scared to criticize their representatives for fear of retribution and that politicians protect one another at the public's expense.
"There's the good-old-boy network in the District of Columbia: 'I do this for you, you do this for me,' " Day said. He knows from personal experience - in e-mails, text messages and phone calls from random critics - of the toll paid by anyone who speaks up.
"Every day, I have to hear how I should be ashamed of myself for ruining [Thomas's] life, and ruining his family's life," Day said.
When he's not battling public corruption, Day, 40, works as a tax accountant. He has lived his whole life in the District and graduated from the city's public schools. He went into politics because he was unhappy about city taxes and poor police performance in his neighborhood.
Some local political leaders think his work will make a difference.
"People, at least for a time, are going to be looking much more closely at money issues," said John Salatti, a Democratic Advisory Neighborhood Commission member in the ward. "When Tim Day comes out with something else on somebody, they're going to give it a little more credence, and not just fob it off as Republican dirty tricks."
That's a lesson that good government supporters from either party could support.

Peanut shared at school causes death
Chesterfield County police have confirmed that a severe allergic reaction killed a 7-year-old who had eaten a peanut given to her by another student on their school playground. 
The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported that Amarria Denise Johnson died Monday after going into cardiac arrest after eating the peanut at Hopkins Road Elementary School.
Police said that Amarria was given the peanut on the playground during a school recess break by a child who was unaware of her severe allergies. An aide in the school clinic was attempting to help her when she stopped breathing.
Detectives consulted with the Chesterfield commonwealth's attorney office, and it was determined that no criminal negligence was committed by the child who shared the peanut, school personnel or Amarria's mother, police said.

Shooting victim in critical condition
Montgomery County policeare investigating a Saturday morning shooting in Gaithersburg that sent one man to the hospital in critical condition.
Police spokesman Lt. Eric Burnett said a fight broke out around 6:15 a.m. in a residence in the 1200 block of Knoll Mist Lane in Gaithersburg. When police arrived, they found a man in his 20s on the first floor, suffering from an apparent gunshot wound. The victim was transported to an area hospital in critical condition.
The preliminary investigation revealed that the victim and a suspect were inside when the suspect became involved in an altercation with another man. The suspect pulled out a gun, a struggle occurred, and the victim, who police said was not involved in the fight, was shot.
The shooting is currently under investigation by Montgomery County's major crimes division.

guidance sought on collecting signatures for Senate run
 
Del. Robert G. Marshall (R-Prince William), who is weighing a run for the U.S. Senate this year, has asked Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli II (R) for an opinion on how to collect signatures for a possible run. Candidates have until March 29 to collect 10,000 signatures from across the state, including 400 from each of the 11 congressional districts, to get their names on the ballot. The question is whether to get signatures from the existing districts or the yet-to-be-drawn new ones. "This is a serious thing," Marshall said. 

Man charged with                        attempted murder of officer
A man who pointed a gun at Virginia state troopers Tuesday after a pursuit on Interstate 95 in Prince William County has been arrested and charged with attempted murder of a police officer, state police said. Steven C. Murray, 54, of the District allegedly aimed a handgun at troopers after his car ran into a ditch and caught fire. State police said he put down the weapon and surrendered. Murray was also charged with driving under the influence of drugs and possession of stolen property.

Jiffy Lube Live  in Bristow                        lifts              tailgating ban
Jiffy Lube Live, the 25,000-capacity concert venue in Bristow said Wednesday that it is lifting the tailgate ban it enacted last year. Jiffy Lube Live, owned and operated by concert promotion colossus Live Nation, says that the decision was prompted by patrons' unhappiness with the ban. The new tailgating policies are as follows: Grills will be allowed. Tents and canopies will still be forbidden. Driving aisles must be kept clear of chairs and tables. And members of the Prince William County police, the Virginia Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control and Jiffy Lube Live staff will continue to enforce a ban on open alcohol containers in the parking lot. Underage drinking will also be targeted aggressively, the venue's general manager, Matt Rogers, said.

MEMOIR
ANATOMY OF A KIDNAPPING
A Doctor's Story
By Steven L. Berk
Texas Tech Univ. 248 pp. $27.95
An ordinary morning can turn into a nightmare in an instant. That's what Steven L. Berk discovered in March 2005, when a gunman broke into his house while he was quietly reading. "Anatomy of a Kidnapping" is Berk's memoir of being kidnapped and forced to drive around his home town of Amarillo, Tex., for four hours while his captor called the shots from the back seat. http://www.amazon.com/dp/0896726932/ref=as_li_tf_til?tag=washpost-books-20&camp=0&creative=0&linkCode=as1&creativeASIN=0896726932&adid=1PHXESBXSEF1N1JSAKNVMore than a reconstruction of the traumatic day, the book is a look back at the author's career as a doctor and how principles from his medical training helped him successfully navigate the crisis.  
Berk recounts medical cases that influenced his decision-making. A patient with a faked illness taught him not to be too trusting and to be creative in looking for solutions; another patient, who died from an avoidable drug interaction, imparted the importance of paying attention to detail. Berk says his medical training helped him stay calm and establish a bond with his captor. When the gunman  complained of having back pain, the doctor switched into professional mode. "I listen to his symptoms and make suggestions about treatment options. . . . I'm a physician, that's what I've been trained to do. I try to ignore the miles of empty space that stretch out around us in every direction."
It was this mind-set that enabled Berk to emerge unharmed from a predictament that was equal parts frightening and bizarre.

MARYLAND

Man killed pushing truck in St. Mary's
A St. Mary's County man who was pushing his stalled truck in an apparent attempt to jump-start it was struck and killed by another driver who unsuccessfully tried to avoid the truck Friday night, authorities said.
The collision, about 7 p.m. on Indian Bridge Road near Knotts Drive, killed Dennis M. Todd, 51,  of California, Md., St. Mary's County Sheriff's Office said. 
The truck had no lights on, and Todd was wearing dark clothing. Todd was standing in the doorway pushing the 1995 Mazda pickup in an effort to get enough speed to hop in and pop the clutch to start it, according to the Sheriff's Office.
A 2007 Hyundai Tiburon driven by Joan L. Farrar, 55, of Tall Timbers, Md., was traveling in the same lane when Farrar noticed the stalled truck and swerved into the northbound lanes to avoid it, but she was forced to swerve back because of oncoming traffic and hit Todd, according to authorities.
No charges are pending against Farrar, said Cindy Allen, a spokeswoman for the Sheriff's Office.

VIRGINIA

2011 state gun sales appear to hit record
Virginia gun sales surged to an apparent record in 2011, fueled in part by shoppers buying more firearms in December.
Virginia State Police statistics on gun buyers' mandatory criminal-background checks showed that there were 321,166 gun transactions last year, with a single-month record of 41,957 in December.
The number of Virginia gun transactions rose 16 percent from 2010 to 2011, the second-largest percentage increase in a decade and the most since President Obama was elected in 2008. That year, Virginia recorded 268,136 gun transactions.
Not all checks represent the sale of a single gun, as some customers buy multiple firearms and other checks involve people reclaiming firearms that had been pawned. Exact sales figures aren't recorded in Virginia.
Nationally, a record 16.4 million firearms background checks - 1.8 million in December - took place in 2011 through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, up from 14.4 million the previous year. 
Neither the FBI nor State Police would offer a theory on the increased activity.

Trust? Thomas took that, too.

BYLINE: Courtland Milloy

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B01

LENGTH: 616 words

The District's elected officials don't seem to realize the gravity of the wound that D.C. Council member Harry Thomas Jr. (D-Ward 5) has inflicted on them. Now that Thomas has resigned and pleaded guilty to embezzlement, they behave as if a few expressions of disappointment and a pledge to do better will put the matter to rest.
"Fundamentally, what is at issue here is the need of the council and government to restore the public trust," said council member Phil Mendelson (D-At Large). 
What trust? There is none to restore. Even if there were no more criminal investigations of elected city officials underway - and there are several doozies - Thomas's actions alone would be enough to drain the council of every last drop of credibility.
Between 2007 and 2009, during a homicide epidemic, Thomas took taxpayer money earmarked to protect children from violence and spent it on himself. And then he'd show up at crime scenes, sometimes driving a $59,000 Audi Quattro SUV that he'd bought with the ill-gotten gains, and declare that residents themselves should be doing more to stop the violence.
"People in general realize it's not just a policing issue," Thomas said in August 2008, appealing to residents in his ward for help in catching the killer of a 13-year-old boy who had been struck by a stray bullet during a drive-by shooting.
Two months later, on Halloween, Thomas took $23,000 that was supposed to help fund a youth sports program and bought himself a motorcycle.
From the council dais, Thomas railed against those who posed a threat to his racket, including then-Mayor Adrian M. Fenty and the city's interim attorney general, Peter Nickles. Residents might rightly wonder whether those who voted with Thomas were knowingly complicit or just being played for fools.
Either way, trust is destroyed.
The same is true regarding those community crime forums. During one 90-minute meeting at the Turkey Thicket Recreation Center in 2008, Fenty, Assistant Police Chief Diane Groomes and a contingent of police officers stood with Thomas trying to assure irate residents that everything possible was being done to make them safer.
Thomas made liars out of all of them.
"There are ongoing feuds in this neighborhood that lead to gunplay," Thomas said in 2007 after seven people, including three children, were wounded during a shootout at a housing complex. "We're trying to get to the bottom of what the issues are."
A while later, he took $7,000 of children's money, bought some suits and went on vacation in Las Vegas.
During the height of the killings, D.C. government officials proposed keeping 11 recreation facilities open on Sundays and until midnight on Saturdays. Thomas was among those favoring the changes, saying:  "That's when people need them. Nights and weekends."
But he was silent when Clark Ray, then the director of the Department of Parks and Recreation, told the D.C. Council that he was "scouring the budget" to find $368,000 to fund the changes.
Ray should have been scouring Thomas's pockets.
All told, according to the U.S. attorney's office, Thomas embezzled more than $350,000 in government funds.
"I am deeply saddened by what has taken place," D.C. Council Chairman Kwame R. Brown (D) said after Thomas resigned. "It is a somber day for the residents, but nothing is to be preferred before justice."
"Nothing is to be preferred before justice." The quote is from Socrates, but Brown's use of it is too clever by half. Why mouth the words when the great philosopher's concept of justice would require that Brown and all the rest of the council relinquish the perks of public office - just resign, all of you - and go do some real public service for a change.

West Virginia loss exposes Hoyas' weaknesses

BYLINE: Tarik El-Bashir

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. D03

LENGTH: 665 words

Although theloss to West Virginia was only their first in 12 games, it underscored a pair of trouble spots for the ninth-ranked Georgetown men's basketball team: cold three-point shooting and uneven rebounding.
The Hoyas made only 2 of 14 attempts from behind the three-point arc in Saturday's 74-62 defeat, extending their shooting slump to three games. In all, they're shooting 30 percent from three-point range since the start of Big East play, which ranks 12th in the conference. 
Georgetown (13-2, 3-1) hopes to reverse that trend when Cincinnati (12-4, 2-1) visits Verizon Center on Monday, two days after the Bearcats' seven-game winning streak was snapped by St. John's at the buzzer. But it doesn't figure to be easy for the Hoyas. Cincinnati sophomore Sean Kilpatrick and his teammates rank second in the conference in three-point defense, limiting opponents to 29.2 percent.
After Saturday's loss in Morgantown, Georgetown Coach John Thompson III pointed to inadequate communication and execution on the defensive end of the floor as the primary culprit. Still, it was impossible to overlook the role three-point accuracy (or lack thereof) played in the Hoyas' first loss since Nov. 21. They connected on only 1 of 8 attempts from long range in the second half, while the Mountaineers sank 3 of 6. 
Thompson said Sunday that he's not overly concerned about the three-point slump, in part because this season's team is better equipped to handle one.
"We're not a team that doesn't want to make threes," he said. "In years past, some would say we lived and died by the three. But I think this team, because of our versatility and the different ways we can score, it's not as important. . . . I just think the ball hasn't gone in two out of those three games."
Georgetown opened the conference schedule an impressive 7 for 11 from long range at Louisville on Dec. 28. The season-best 63.6-percent performance fueled the Hoyas' 71-68 victory.
Since that signature win, though, the Georgetown has made only 11 of 49 attempts, or 22.4 percent. While junior swingman Hollis Thompson has made five of his 11 three-point attempts the past three games, senior Jason Clark is 3 for 15 and sophomore Markel Starks has made only one of his nine attempts (after sinking all four of his attempts vs. the Cardinals). 
The Hoyas' three-point struggles were never more apparent than during a critical second half stretch against the Mountaineers. 
With the West Virginia clinging to a 41-37 lead, Clark missed from beyond the arc. At the other end of the floor, Mountaineers senior Kevin Jones sank a three-pointer 14 seconds later, making it 44-37. Starks and Greg Whittington each misfired from long range attempts on the Hoyas' next two possessions, and the hosts pulled away. 
"That sequence was important," Thompson said. "It was a stretch where, three possessions in a row, we took threes. This team doesn't have to do that. At least two of those were not good shots. We were trying to answer them, as opposed to, 'Let's get the best shot.' "
Another area where Thompson would like to see improvement is on the boards. The Hoyas have been out-rebounded in each of the past three games, including a 37-31 deficit Saturday. 
Georgetown has have only been out-rebounded five times; it happened in both losses.
Thompson said the key to reversing that trend is getting perimeter players more involved. Freshman forward Otto Porter leads the Hoyas with 6.8 rebounds per game, while Clark and Starks, the starting back court, rank fifth and 10th on the team, respectively. 
The Bearcats, meantime, feature one of the conference's top rebounders in 6-foot-9, 260-pound senior Yancy Gates, who is averaging 9.1 per game to go along with 12.4 points.
 "A lot of times, when it comes to rebounding, the focus on the front court," Thompson said. "We need our perimeter guys to do a much better job of getting in there and running down rebounds, to help and support the guys in box-outs down there."

NATO member killed;local soldier suspected
NATO says one of its service members has been killed in southern Afghanistan, apparently by an Afghan soldier.
The coalition statement said the incident occurred Sunday, but there was no information about the victim's nationality.
The shooting, which brought to 11 the number of NATO troops killed this month, appeared to be the latest in a series of attacks by members of the Afghan security forces against coalition partners.
The incidents have raised fears of increased Taliban infiltration of the Afghan police and army. NATO officials cited different causes and backgrounds for the incidents and said they were not an indication of guerrilla activity within the Afghan ranks.

Cameron backs curbs on executive bonuses
Britain's prime minister has backed granting company shareholders the power to veto executive pay packages in a bid to curb public anger at many bosses' lavish salaries and bonuses.
David Cameron said he wants to tackle the huge pay raises given to some top executives, despite their companies not improving their performances.
Cameron told the BBC on Sunday that laws to regulate high pay in banks are likely to be proposed in the next few months.
There were no details on how the arrangements would work, but they could form part of a reform package being prepared by Business Secretary Vince Cable.
The leaders of all three major parties in Britain have attacked the excessive bonuses in recent days, amid continuing public anger over the issue.

Musharraf to return,lead party in polls
Exiled former president Pervez Musharraf said Sunday that he would return to Pakistan this month to lead his recently formed party in campaigning for parliamentary elections, despite the possibility of his arrest and concern about his security.
"There are efforts to scare me, but these people don't know that I'm not among the afraid," Musharraf told a rally of about 8,000 supporters in Karachi, Pakistan's commercial center, via video link from Dubai, the United Arab Emirates.
The former general said he would return between Jan. 27 and 30. His return, to lead his All Pakistan Muslim League's campaign for elections due by 2013, would add to the political uncertainty at a time of tension between the weak civilian government and the powerful military, which sets foreign and security policies.

Immunity approved for Saleh, his officials
Yemen's cabinet on Sunday approved a law granting President Ali Abdullah Saleh and anyone who has worked under him immunity from prosecution for any crimes committed during his rule.
The decision came as a surprise to many in Yemen, who thought that a power-transfer deal he signed in November granted him and his family immunity from prosecution for the killings of protesters during an 11-month-old popular uprising but would not extend to cover his 33-year-long rule and anyone who worked in government.
The cabinet approved the law despite daily nationwide protests demanding that he be put on trial.

Heavy snow slows road, rail travel in Alps: Heavy snow blanketed much of the central Alpine region between eastern Switzerland and western Austria, causing traffic accidents and bringing road and rail traffic to a crawl. Three feet of snow has been dumped in some areas in three days.  Part of a major east-west railway link in Austria's Tyrol province remained closed Sunday.
Radical sect kills 6 in northeast Nigeria: Police said suspected members of a radical Islamist sect have killed six people in two attacks in northeast Nigeria. Police said gunmen attacked a military vehicle Sunday in Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state. A military spokesman said three civilians were killed and six civilians and a soldier were wounded. Local police commissioner Simeon Midenda said an attack on a tea shop Saturday in Borno's Biu town killed three people. At least 52 people have been killed in recent days by Boko Haram, which is carrying out an increasingly bloody sectarian assault against Nigeria's weak government.

Giffords leads pledge at Tucson vigil

BYLINE: Amanda Lee Myers

DATELINE: TUCSON

TUCSON - Rep. Gabrielle Giffords led a crowd in the Pledge of Allegiance, her words reverberating across a cold Tucson night Sunday in a rare public appearance at a candlelight vigil one year after surviving a deadly shooting.
The Democratic congresswoman - who has struggled to relearn to walk after being shot in the head - stepped onstage to cheers from the crowd. Ron Barber, a staff member who was wounded in the rampage that killed six people one year ago, invited her to lead the audience in the pledge.
The crowd chanted: "Gabby, Gabby." 
She limped to the lectern, and her husband, Mark Kelly, helped lift her left hand over her heart. After months of intensive speech therapy, Giffords recited the pledge with the audience, head held high and a smile on her face.
The remembrance at the University of Arizona concluded a day of events, including a church service that drew hundreds in the afternoon and a citywide bell-ringing at 10:11 a.m., the exact time a gunman started shooting at an political event on Jan. 8, 2011.
With hugs and tears, southern Arizonans remembered the dead, the shattered lives and those who acted heroically after the gunman opened fire at an outdoor meet-and-greet that severely wounded Giffords and 12 others.
"Those of us who survived were forever changed by that moment," Kelly said. "For the past year, we've had new realities to live with, the reality and pain of letting go of the past.
"There's a reality that life is unpredictable, and that even in the best of times, our cherished friends, the good, the caring, the innocent among us, the closest and dearest people we know, can be taken from us," he said.
Earlier in the day, a crowd at St. Augustine Cathedral recited the 23rd Psalm and watched as relatives of the six dead walked solemnly down the aisle with a single red rose, placing the flowers in a vase in front of a picture of a heart.
"Even in the midst of this troubling year, the healing, the courage that we have experienced in our community - each one of us can notice how our cups overflow with the blessings of our lives," said Stephanie Aaron, Giffords's rabbi.
Hundreds of people at the cathedral - including Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer - stood and chanted, "We remember, we remember, we remember with grateful hearts." Some closed their eyes while others held each other.
At the evening service, 19 candles marked the lost and the survivors. Giffords and Kelly lit one candle together as an orchestra played and many in the crowd wept. The emotional service brought together many who survived the shooting and those who lost loved ones.
Giffords, 41, has spent the past year in Houston undergoing intensive physical and speech therapy in a recovery that doctors and family have called miraculous. She is able to walk and talk, vote in Congress and gave a televised interview to ABC's Diane Sawyer in May.
But doctors have said it would take many months to determine the lasting effects of her brain injury. The three-term congresswoman has four months to decide whether to seek reelection.
Jared Lee Loughner has pleaded not guilty to 49 charges in the shooting. The 23-year-old, who has bipolar disorder, is being forcibly medicated at a Missouri prison facility in an effort to make him mentally ready for trial.
President Obama called Giffords on Sunday to offer his support and to tell her that he and the first lady are keeping her, the families of those killed and the Tucson community in their thoughts and prayers, according to a White House statement.

Led strife-riven Guinea-Bissau

BYLINE: Assimo Balde

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B06

DATELINE: BISSAU, GUINEABISSAU

BISSAU, Guinea-Bissau - President Malam Bacai Sanha, who was elected in this tiny, coup-prone nation on Africa's western coast more than two years ago after the previous leader was assassinated, died Jan. 9 at a hospital in Paris. 
No immediate cause was given, but the 64-year-old president was known to have diabetes and had undergone medical treatment in both France and neighboring Senegal during his time in office. National radio announced his death.
The head of the National Assembly, Raimundo Pereira, is expected to take over until new elections can be organized. He served as interim head of state after the 2009 assassination of former President Joao Bernardo "Nino" Vieira.
Since gaining independence from Portugal, Guinea-Bissau has been wracked by coups and has become one of the main transit points for drug traffickers ferrying cocaine to Europe. Just two weeks ago, the army said a top military official had attempted unsuccessfully to seize power while Mr. Sanha was ill.
Mr. Sanha won the presidential election held in 2009 after Vieira's death, a peaceful transition of power that marked a rare bright spot for Guinea-Bissau. He became less known for what he did as president than for his frequent hospitalizations abroad, which were always described by aides as routine checkups.
United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon paid tribute to Mr. Sanha's leadership, noting in a statement that he guided Guinea-Bissau "at a particularly difficult time in its history."
Mr. Sanha was born May 5, 1947, in Dar Salam, Guinea-Bissau. He began his political career as head of the youth wing of the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde, which waged a war for independence from the 1950s until Portugal withdrew in 1974. Mr. Sanha went on to become a member of the party's executive committee and then served as a governor of a province.
Mr. Sanha was thrown to the fore after Vieira was gunned down inside his home in March 2009. 
The circumstances of Vieira's death have never been fully explained, but many speculated that his killing was related to issues surrounding drug trafficking.
In recent years, Guinea-Bissau has become a hub for drug smuggling. Cocaine is flown from South America to the islands that dot the country's coast. The drugs are moved to Europe by boat or by "mules" who ingest the drugs and attempt to carry them north on commercial flights.
Mr. Sanha had pledged to combat the flow of narcotics. Nevertheless, he appointed Jose Americo Bubo Na Tchuto, labeled by the U.S. Treasury Department as a drug kingpin, to head the navy in early October.
Carlos Vamain, a political analyst and former justice minister, called Mr. Sanha's presidency difficult and complex.
"Difficult in the context of narco-trafficking and also the unchanging socioeconomic problems of the country," Vamain said. "His presidency did not bring the results people had hoped."

Killer was after victim's sneakers, police say

BYLINE: Paul Duggan

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B01

LENGTH: 371 words

A young man shot to death on a D.C. street early Sunday apparently was the target of a robber who wanted his $200 Nike sneakers, police said.
David Lee Robinson, 19, clad in a pair of white Nike Zoom Rookies, was standing in the 5800 block of Foote Street NE shortly before 2:30 a.m. when at least one robber with a handgun got out of a sport-utility vehicle, police said. 
"It would appear that he was shot probably after he was robbed, but it's also possible that he got shot prior to being robbed," a D.C. police homicide supervisor, Lt. Robert Alder, said Monday.
Also unclear is who else fired shots. Investigators found a handgun - apparently not the murder weapon - and an assortment of spent shells at the scene, Alder said.
Robinson was with an acquaintance when the shooting occurred near 58th and Foote streets at the far eastern tip of the city, near the border with Prince George's County, Alder said. The other person escaped harm.
Alder said detectives haven't determined whether Robinson or someone with him fired at the robber, who appeared to be accompanied by three or four other people in the SUV.
"We're still investigating the sequence," he said.
Alder said detectives have found no indication that Robinson and his assailant were acquainted or that Robinson, who lived in Northwest Washington, was robbed of anything other than the high-top sneakers.
"At this point, we're not ruling anything out, but we don't have any information that suggests this was not a stranger-on-stranger robbery," Alder said.
Robinson was pronounced dead at Howard University Hospital. Hours later, at a previously scheduled church vigil against gun violence Sunday night, Mayor Vincent C. Gray (D) called the shooting "not only tragic" but "incredibly disquieting."
"A life for a pair of Nike tennis shoes?" the mayor said. "Come on, ladies and gentlemen. It's time for us to be able to end this kind of tragic violence in our society."
Alder said police have only a vague description of the robber and are looking for a small, silver or gray four-door SUV.
"We believe the vehicle would have some bullet holes in it and possibly some broken glass," he said.
District police have reported three homicides so far in 2012.

Ex-soldier accused of bid to aid terrorists

BYLINE: Matt Zapotosky

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B01

LENGTH: 665 words

A former U.S. soldier trained in cryptology and intelligence was charged Monday with attempting to provide material support to a terrorist organization after he flew to Africa in an unsuccessful bid to join al-Shabab, a group with links to al-Qaeda, authorities said.
Craig B. Baxam, 24, of Laurel told FBI agents that he had no contacts with al-Shabab and only a haphazard plan to connect with the group when he boarded a flight out of Baltimore-Washington International Marshall Airport last month, according to a federal criminal complaint. But he said he shared al-Shabab's religious beliefs - at least as he had read them on an Islamic Web site - and he considered himself obligated to move to land that the group controlled in Somalia. 
Baxam appeared in U.S. District Court in Greenbelt on Monday. Kenyan authorities arrested him Dec. 23 near Mombasa, according to authorities. He later told FBI agents that he had been trying to join al-Shabab mainly because he wanted to live somewhere that rigorously adhered to sharia, or Islamic, law, court papers say.
In an interview with FBI agents outlined in the complaint, Baxam admitted a willingness to commit violence, though mostly in defending al-Shabab's Somali territories from potential invaders. He told the agents that he was specifically seeking al-Shabab - not al-Qaeda - and that he felt offensive jihad was questionable.
Still, Baxam acknowledged that al-Shabab was sometimes responsible for suicide bombings, according to the complaint, and he said he was "looking for dying with a gun in my hand" and would be happy to die defending Islam. He also said al-Shabab's practice of beating people seen on the street during what is supposed to be prayer time was "awesome."
Why Baxam became fascinated with al-Shabab and radical Islam remains unclear. A 2005 graduate of Laurel High School who was born in Takoma Park, Baxam joined the U.S. Army in 2007 and completed advanced training in cryptology and intelligence, according to the criminal complaint. He served in Baghdad, then reenlisted for a year-long stint in South Korea.
Baxam left the Army in July - a month before his term was over and about a week after he had "secretly" converted to Islam, according to the complaint. Baxam told agents that he discovered Islam while he was browsing the Internet and had no previous religious affiliation. An online article he read about the Islamic day of judgment "spoke to" him, authorities wrote in the complaint, and he read more.
Baxam's plan to reach al-Shabab, though, was something less than ironclad. He set out with only a Koran and some other religious texts, a prayer mat, towel and razors, according to the complaint. He carried about $700 in cash and planned to donate it to al-Shabab.
After making his way to Mombasa, then Malindi, Baxam told a taxi driver to take him "as far north as possible" in Kenya, according to the complaint. Dropped off in a city whose name he could not recall, he tried to take a bus to the northern city of Garissa, according to the complaint. He was arrested on that bus by Kenyan police, who suspected that he was trying to travel to Somalia, according to the complaint.
Reached by phone, Baxam's brother declined to comment and said he did not know whether Baxam had obtained a lawyer. Efforts to reach other family members were unsuccessful.
Baxam told FBI agents that after his military service he worked for a television services company in Maryland but spent much of his time reading and praying, according to the complaint. He soon decided that he needed to move somewhere governed by sharia law, according to the complaint, so he set off for Somalia.
Baxam said he destroyed his computer, withdrew $3,500 that he had saved and purchased a plane ticket to Kenya, according to the complaint. He booked a round-trip flight, according to the complaint, so his activities would not raise authorities' suspicions.

Man charged in alleged bomb plot
A 25-year-old Florida man was charged in connection with an alleged plot to plant bombs at nightclubs, a sheriff's office and businesses in the Tampa area, the U.S. Justice Department said. 
Sami Osmakac, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in the former Yugoslavia, was charged with attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction, Justice said Monday. If convicted, he faces life in prison and a $250,000 fine.
Osmakac had worked with a man who was an FBI informant. The man recorded conversations with him discussing attacks, according to court papers. 
Osmakac asked the informant for help buying guns and explosives, according to the affidavit. He was arrested after getting an explosives belt, a pistol, grenades and an AK-47 assault rifle from an undercover FBI agent, according to court papers. The weapons had been rendered inoperable.

House Democrats suspend boycott
Indiana House Democrats on Monday ended a three-day boycott of the legislature over a contentious labor bill but are not promising to stay long enough to allow a final vote on the measure.
House Democratic Leader Patrick Bauer said that Democrats are returning "just for today."
Republicans want to make Indiana the first state in more than a decade to enact right-to-work legislation, which bans employment contracts that require union fees for representation. Democrats had stalled work by denying Republicans the 67 members they need to conduct business.

Charity linked to Hamas disbands
An Ohio-based charity suspected by the U.S. government of having ties to the militant Islamic group Hamas has disbanded.
Last week's filing comes nearly six years after the Treasury Department ordered U.S. banks to freeze the group's assets. It accused the group of funneling money to a terrorist organization.
Leaders of KindHearts for Charitable Humanitarian Development denied being connected to terrorism and sued the government. The group says it provides humanitarian aid to the poor.

Robbers return to crime scene: Investigators say three young robbers are in jail after returning to a Southern California crime scene to retrieve surveillance-camera video. Authorities say the trio stole beer from Dooley's Liquor Store in Santa Clarita on Sunday night and fled. They returned 85 minutes later to get the surveillance video. Police told City News Service that there was a scuffle and one of the robbers slashed the store clerk's arm.
Soldiers confined to base: About 100 soldiers at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state have been restricted to base as investigators try to track what an Army reward poster lists as 150 stolen items. The items, including night-vision goggles and rifle scopes, are valued at $600,000, according to  the Army Criminal Investigation Command.Father admits throwing son overboard: A father who tossed his 7-year-old son overboard during a Southern California harbor cruise has pleaded guilty to felony child abuse and endangerment. Sloan Briles was sentenced to enter child-abuse and alcohol-treatment programs. Prosecutors said the 35-year-old Irvine man was drunk during a cruise in August when he slapped his son, then threw him off the boat.

McDonnell, GOP prepare for big push in legislature

DATELINE: RICHMOND

RICHMOND - Beforethe November elections, Gov. Robert F. McDonnell predicted expectations would be high if fellow Republicans took control of both chambers of the Virginia General Assembly.
He was right.
As legislators return to the Capitol for the General Assembly'sannual sessionWednesday, McDonnell and Republican lawmakers say they are under pressure to tackle kitchen-table concerns, such as job creation, and not be tripped up by social issueshttp://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/analysis-what-a-republican-win-means-for-va/2011/11/04/gIQAFjXo4M_story.htmlhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/analysis-what-a-republican-win-means-for-va/2011/11/04/gIQAFjXo4M_story.htmlsuch as gun rights.
Republicans are eager to capitalize on their newfound strength while not turning off independent voters who will be critical to this year's presidential and U.S. Senate races.
"It's tougher,'' Sen. Jill Holtzman Vogel (R-Winchester) said. "We have way more opportunity to demonstrate that we can deliver in a rational, measured way.'' 
McDonnell, starting the most important legislative session of his term, has an agenda that would pump billions of dollars into the state's retirement system, unclog roads, award more college degreesand spur job creation.
At a news conference Monday, he unveiled several proposals intended to raise academic standards, improve teacher quality, and promote charter and virtual schools.
McDonnell will push for the repeal of a 30-year law that sets the first day of school after Labor Day. He has proposed establishing an annual contract and evaluation process for teachers, replacing the tenurelike job protections afforded by traditional multiyear contracts. The measure is intended to strengthen school divisions' ability to remediate or remove poorly performing teachers.
"We have a large number of big ideas and big problems that I want to fix this session,'' McDonnell said in a recent interview in his Capitol Square office. "We're not taking a pass on fixing these big problems and kicking those cans down the road.''
Republicans picked up two seats in the Senate, and they immediately claimed control because Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling (R) can cast tie-breaking votesin the equally divided chamber. And they will hold a hefty 68-seat majority in the 100-member House of Delegates - the highest in Virginia history.
McDonnell will join with Republican legislative leaders Tuesday to talk about their priorities - making government smaller and more efficient, boosting the fragile economy and saving money for a rainy day.
Brian Moran, chairman of the Democratic Party of Virginia, said the Republican plan is anything but aggressive - perhaps all the more surprising since they will hold both the legislature and Governor's Mansion for only the second time since the Civil War. "We expected a bolder vision,'' he said.

Focusing on the budget
McDonnell, one of the nation's most popular governorsand a possible vice presidential contender, hopes new allies in the General Assembly will help him leave a lasting mark on the state.
"This session is one where he can certainly have an imprint on government,'' said Sen. Ryan McDougle (Hanover), chairman of the Republican caucus. "Virginia is a fairly well-run state, but there are things we can do better - absolutely."
Democrats, who are still pressing to share power in the Senate, say McDonnell still needs their help, especially because Bolling is barred from voting on the budget.
"The governor's going to need to work with us," Sen. Ralph S. Northam (D-Norfolk) said. "I think he needs to reach out to us."
Legislators will consider thousands of billsin 60 days, ranging from health care to uranium mining in Southside Virginia, but McDonnell's first two-year budget will dominate the session.
McDonnell's $85 billion spending blueprint includes shuffling millions of dollars from public schools and health care to his top priorities of pension reform, higher education and transportation.
One of his most controversial proposals is to spend $110 million more to ease clogged roads by boosting the portion of the sales tax spent on transportation - a move Democrats said will take money away from education, public safety and other core services.
Sen Richard L. Saslaw (Fairfax), the Democratic leader in the Senate, called McDonnell's recommendation to divert money to transportation a "gutless act."
McDonnell scoffed at that criticism - and returned fire. He suggested Saslaw show "his guts" by proposing a tax increase and seeing the reception it gets in the legislature.
"I think it takes more guts to tell people what your priorities are and to be able to make the tough decisions on reallocating money,'' McDonnell said.
But even before the session starts, it became clear that McDonnell may not get the support he needs from members of his own party on transportation.
"That is a bottomless pit and, if allowed to continue to grow, will continue to undermine funding for education, public safety, health care, the courts, all of the above,'' Sen. John C. Watkins (R-Chesterfield) said. "It needs to pay for itself.''

Dealing with social issues
McDonnell said he does not plan to push hot-button subjects, including abortion and immigration, and will spend the session on less controversial issues - jobs, traffic congestion and education.
House Speaker William J. Howell (R-Stafford) said he supports McDonnell's agenda. (Sen. Thomas K. Norment of James City, the Senate Republican leader, has kept a low profile since the election and did not return phone calls.)
But conservatives, even those who campaigned on boosting jobs, curbing spending and streamlining government, are counting on McDonnell to back proposals that have been derailed in the past by Senate Democrats.
Already, they have introduced bills that would give rights to "unborn children," lift some background checks for gun owners and require the police to determine the immigration status of any person who is arrested.
McDonnell, who has built a national profile as the leader of the Republican Governors Association, will have to decide whether the image he wants to project in the final two years of his term will be that of a centrist or more of a conservative.
But the governor played that down, saying he doesn't mind that more conservative issues will cross his desk.
"Nobody should be surprised that I continue to be pro-life, pro-family and a fiscal and a social conservative,'' McDonnell said. "I've supported those issues for 21 years, and nothing's changed.''

Gov. Barbour pardons 4 murderers in Mississippi

BYLINE: Reuters

LENGTH: 241 words

DATELINE: STARKVILLE, MISS.

STARKVILLE, Miss. - Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour pardoned four convicted murderers who worked at the governor's mansion, releasing them from prison in the final days of his term, state officials said on Monday. 
In all, Barbour pardoned four men convicted of murder and another convicted of burglary and robbery, all serving life sentences. He wrote in executive orders that each "proved to be a diligent and dedicated workman."
Barbour, a former Republican National Committee chairman who had considered running for president in 2012, is due to leave office Thursday. His office did not return calls for comment.
The pardoned inmates included David Glenn Gatlin, who was denied parole in December on his conviction for fatally shooting his estranged wife while she cradled their baby in 1993.
"He shot her in the head while she was holding a baby. He's a coldblooded murderer," said Tiffany Ellis Brewer, the victim's sister.
Her family joined Democratic lawmakers at a news conference in the capital, Jackson, on Monday, demanding limits to the governor's ability to pardon killers.
Gatlin had worked at the mansion since November 2009, state records show.
The other pardoned inmates were Charles Hooker, a teacher convicted in 1993 of murdering his school's principal; Anthony McCray, convicted of killing his wife in 2001; Joseph Ozment, convicted in 1993 of murder, conspiracy and armed robbery; and another man serving life for burglary and robbery.

Nigeria

3 killed as crowds protest fuel prices
A national strike paralyzed much of Nigeria on Monday, with more than 10,000 demonstrators swarming its commercial capital to protest soaring fuel prices and decades of government corruption in the oil-rich country.
At least one person was killed in the unrest in Lagos, and a large mob of people pushed the body in a wheelbarrow down the street. And in the northern city of Kano, two people were killed when security officers fired at a crowd of demonstrators.
Protesters in Lagos took gas from motorbikes to set tires ablaze. And some waved placards bearing an effigy of President Goodluck Jonathan with devil horns and fanged teeth, and showing him pumping gas. 
Police carrying assault rifles and gas masks largely stood by as the demonstrators in Lagos marched on the first day of an indefinite strike called by labor unions. Crowds also took to the streets of the capital, Abuja.

Pakistan

Ex-envoy to U.S. testifies in probe
Pakistan's ex-envoy to the United States formally rejected allegations that he was behind a memo sent to Washington that sought its help in preventing a purported army coup. Husain Haqqani testified Monday before a Supreme Court commission in Islamabad looking into the affair.
The probe could add to pressure on the already shaky civilian government, especially if it finds that President Asif Ali Zardari knew about the memo. He, too, denies any link to the memo.
The country is already struggling with urgent economic and security challenges.
On Monday, government officials said Islamist militants killed 10 paramilitary soldiers they had been holding hostage since last month, the second time the insurgents have killed security force captives close to the Afghan border in a week.
The powerful army was outraged when news of the memo affair  broke last year, and Haqqani resigned as a result.

Malaysia

Opposition leader Anwar acquitted
Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim celebrated a surprising triumph over sodomy charges Monday, pledging to focus his energies on toppling the government in elections expected this year.
The Kuala Lumpur High Court acquitted Anwar in a case involving a male former aide, ruling that the state's DNA evidence was unreliable in a verdict that upended Anwar's worst-case scenario of a 20-year prison term.
Prime Minister Najib Razak's administration described the judgment as a repudiation of Anwar's long-standing insistence that the government trumped up the charges to thwart his hopes to become Malaysia's next leader.
Anwar said he was "pleasantly shocked" by the verdict but remained convinced the case was politically motivated. "To assume the judiciary is independent is a bit far-fetched," he said.

Syrian forces open fire in Homs: Syrian troops fired on protesters Monday in the city of Homs as Arab League monitors toured the area to see whether the regime of  Bashar al-Assad is abiding by its pledge to halt a nine-month-old crackdown on dissent, activists said. The opposition says several hundred people have been killed by the regime since monitors arrived in Syria in December.
Cabinet member speaks out on Israeli Arabs: Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman said Monday that some Israeli Arabs should be stripped of citizenship and placed under Palestinian sovereignty as part of any final peace deal. He made the remarks before a meeting of Israeli and Palestinian negotiators in Jordan - their second session in a week after a 15-month halt in talks.
Life sentence sought for Frankfurt killer: Prosecutors are asking for a sentence of life in prison for an alleged Islamic extremist who has admitted killing two U.S. airmen at the Frankfurt airport last year. Prosecutor Jochen Weingarten told the Frankfurt state court in closing arguments Monday that Arid Uka deserved the maximum possible sentence due to the brutal nature of the crime.

Group claims 37 attacks in Iraqi capital

BYLINE: Dan Morse

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A08

LENGTH: 897 words

DATELINE: BAGHDAD

BAGHDAD -  A terrorist group affiliated with al-Qaeda has asserted responsibility for 37 recent attacks in Iraq's capital, including what the organization called a failed attempt to assassinate the prime minister, as violence continued throughout the country Monday.
The latest attacks - targeting Shiite pilgrims, police officers, at least one army officer and a bank executive - heightened fears in a country reeling from a series of bombingsin the wake of the departure of U.S. troops last month. Iraq also remains locked in a political crisis, a large part of it being played out along sectarian lines.  
On Monday, five people were killed and 32 were injured in a car bombing outside a Shiite mosque in Baghdad, according to security officials speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. A blast 30 minutes earlier killed seven people and injured 19 in the capital, the officials said. 
Also, the chairman of a private bank and her husband were fatally shot inside their garage by men with silencer-equipped pistols, the officials said.
On Monday evening, two bombs blew up near a federal police patrol in Baghdad's Jasr Diala neighborhood, injuring three officers and three civilians, security officials said. About the same time, a bomb exploded under a car in the al-Qahera neighborhood, wounding two men.
To the west of Baghdad, in the Fallujah area, a soldier was killed and three others were injured near a military base when a bomb exploded under his vehicle. And a member of the Sons of Iraq, a group of Sunni fighters who helped U.S. troops battle forces of the organization al-Qaeda in Iraq, was killed in a blast near the gate of his house, said Lt. Col. Najim al-Dulaimi, a spokesman for Anbar province's operations command. 
South of Baghdad, attacks continued against at least two groups of Shiite pilgrims. One person was killed and at least 22 were injured, according to security officials. 
Othman al-Ghanimi, head of the middle Euphrates operations command, said forces stopped an explosives-laden car and arrested the driver, who was carrying a special badge authorizing him to enter the holy city of Karbala, where the pilgrims are headed.
It was not clear whether anyone had asserted responsibility for the Monday attacks. 
But the earlier attacks were the work of the Islamic State of Iraq, the al-Qaeda affiliate asserted on Internet message forums, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, a monitoring service.
The group said that on Nov. 28, a bomber exploited a security "loophole" in Baghdad's Green Zone and drove an explosives-laden vehicle inside with the intent of striking Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, according to SITE. But the vehicle detonated prematurely outside the parliament building, the SITE report said.
The Islamic State of Iraq also asserted responsibility for a Dec. 26 bombing outside Iraq's Interior Ministry, which houses the country's internal security forces, and for a wave of bombings in Baghdad on Dec. 22. The group said the attacks were carried out as revenge for the detention of Sunnis in Shiite prisons, according to SITE.
Iskander Witwit, a ranking member of the parliament's security and defense committee, cautioned against accepting the terrorist group's assertions of responsibility for the bombing outside parliament. He said officials continue to investigate the attack.
Ali Hadi al-Moussawi, a spokesman for Maliki, said the prime minister was targeted because he is committed to "the destruction of al-Qaeda."
He added that al-Qaeda in Iraq "may perpetrate crimes, but that will only increase the unity of the Iraqi people." Moussawi said lapses in Green Zone security have been addressed.
The terrorist group has bragged in its Internet postings about its ability "to penetrate the complicated military and security complex of the fortified Green Zone, which the Crusader enemy had spent billions upon," according to SITE. 
Referring to the November attack, the terrorists said that in "His wisdom," God intervened as the driver was on the way to Maliki's office by "creating a specific defect so that the vehicle exploded while it was parked behind the entrance of the parliament, causing the death and wounding of many people," according to SITE.
Sterling Jensen, who studies the Islamic State of Iraq at the Near East South Asia Center for Strategic Studies, said the group is targeting Shiites to create the impression that it is defending Sunnis. "It is a sign they want sectarian violence to increase," he said.
Joost Hiltermann, deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa program at the International Crisis Group, said that "it's too early to tell" whether the organization is getting stronger.  The group is Sunni-based, motivated by a hatred of Shiite power and Iran, and it sees Iran as controlling Iraq's government, Hiltermann said.  The terrorists are trying to instigate Iraqi security forces to strike back against the country's Sunni population - igniting a full-scale sectarian war, he said.
"They want to create a chaotic situation," Hiltermann added.

Wizards snag their first win

BYLINE: Michael Lee

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. D05

LENGTH: 873 words

John Wall blocked Toronto Raptors guard Jose Calderon's jumper and Jordan Crawford scooped up the ball near midcourt. Wall and JaVale McGee both took off on a full-out sprint and jumped as Crawford tossed the ball toward the rim. 
McGee got in front of Wall, went up a little higher to catch the ball and threw it down. Wall could only shake his head and smile, something he hasn't had many opportunities to do this season. 
"I thought it was for me," Wall said with a grin afterward. "He's just 7 feet. I couldn't get there."
It was that kind of night for the Washington Wizards, who won their first game of the season, 93-78, at Verizon Center. They often not only had more than one favorable option available on offense but also someone capable of finishing. The Wizards have struggled offensively for much of this season, but they finally made the extra pass, made open shots and put together a solid defensive effort.
And in a rare scene, players gave each other high fives on the way off the court, smiles were all around, and fans gave them a standing ovation. The win had been a long time coming, since the Wizards had not tasted victory since April 11, when they defeated Boston in the second-to-last game of last season.
"It felt good to get a win instead of getting booed," Nick Young said after he and Rashard Lewis led the team with 15 points apiece. "It was like a playoff game. I felt like jumping in the stands."
With the Wizards (1-8) in desperate need of something different, Coach Flip Saunders decided to mix up his starting lineup by replacing Andray Blatche with Trevor Booker, their undersized but high-energy forward who had been the team's best player over the past three games. Saunders also kept rookie Chris Singleton in the starting lineup instead of Lewis, who had missed the previous loss against Minnesota with a sore right knee. 
The new starting lineup didn't yield immediate results, as the Wizards were outscored, 20-17, in an ugly first period. But it did provide Saunders with more flexibility in his rotation and give the team more firepower coming off the bench. 
Blatche had aggravated a right shoulder injury the day before in practice, when Saunders initially made the roster move, and was listed as a game-time decision.
Blatche didn't appear to be hurting as he took 11 shots, scored nine points and even grabbed eight rebounds - one of them with only his injured arm. "That was pretty good, right?" Blatche said, adding that he elected to "tough it out" to "support my teammates." 
"When we playing like that, I don't have no problem doing that role," Blatche said of coming off the bench. "We should have confidence and some kind of swagger about ourselves. We didn't just win, we actually played well. It's fine with me. as long as we're winning. If we're not winning, that's when things change."
Saunders also got some quality production from rookies Shelvin Mack and Jan Vesely. Vesely had an uneven debut on Sunday, but on Tuesday he was energetic on both ends of the floor, fighting for rebounds, creating five steals and providing two highlight dunks. He stole the ball from Calderon, dribbled up the court, dunked with two hands and got a standing ovation from the fans. He later soared high above the rim to catch an impossible alley-oop pass from Mack. Despite being well outside the paint, Vesely was still able to throw down the ball, and he shivered as a form of celebration.
Ten players scoredas the Wizards set new season highs with 48.8 percent shooting and 20 assists. "Everybody coach put in the game played well," Singleton said after scoring nine points and grabbing a team-high nine rebounds.
The Wizards were the last team in the NBA without a victory, setting a franchise record for futility to start the season, but they took advantage of a Toronto team that was coming to Washington for the second game of a three-games-in-three-nights set. They took control of the game in the second and third period, when they outscored the Raptors 54-32, forced 15 turnovers and handed out 14 assists.
They also had to spend the previous two days hearing about how terrible they were after losing at home by 21 points to a team that arrived in town with just two wins. 
Saunders credited owner Ted Leonsis, who applauded the team from his courtside seat throughout the game. "You know, like Ted even said before the game: 'Don't listen to anything you hear. We know what we've planned and what we've done and how we're going about doing it. At times it's going to look bad. Don't lose sight of where we're trying to get, and the process that we're going through,' " Saunders said. 
"It's about time for all of us," said Wall, who had nine assists. 
Though Wall had another difficult night shooting the ball as he missed 9 of 12 shots and finished with just eight points, there was no reason to get upset on Tuesday, even as McGee beat him to an easy alley-oop. "I didn't even know John was behind me. I thought I dunked on somebody and I realized it was my teammate," McGee said with a laugh, before reflecting on the win. "I'm sort of relieved. But we still only got one win. We still got the worst record right now. We've got to get some more wins. I'm not satisfied with one win."

Man is sentenced to 100 years in thefts

BYLINE: Matt Zapotosky

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B05

LENGTH: 594 words

The man charged in the 2009 slayings of a mother and daughter in Largo was sentenced to a century in prison Tuesday in a separate, federal case in which he was convicted of orchestrating home invasion robberies, molesting a teenage girl and burglarizing a Maryland gun shop. 
Jason Thomas Scott, 28, who was found guilty in July of home invasion, weapons and sex-related charges, did not appear to react as District Judge Peter J. Messitte effectively ordered him locked up for the rest of his life. Asked if he wanted to say anything, Scott said only, "On the advice of my counsel, I don't want to make a statement at this time."  
Messitte had significantly more to say. As he delivered the sentence - three years above the mandatory minimum for the crimes - the judge called Scott a "bad man" who showed "no indication that you would ever rehabilitate, at least not in this life." 
"You were not just a one-man crime wave, you were a tsunami of crime," Messitte said.    
Separate from the federal case, Scott is charged in the slayings of Delores Dewitt, 42, and her daughter Ebony, 20, whose bodies were found inside a stolen car that had been set on fire in a Largo driveway on March 16, 2009. His trial in the slayings is scheduled for October. Scott is also a suspect in the Jan. 16, 2009, slayings of Karen Lofton, 45, and her daughter, Karissa, 16, in Largo, and in the June 2008 killing of 46-year-old Vilma Butler in Bowie, police said.
But the home invasion robberies, authorities say, are where Scott perfected his criminal craft. 
His operation was as sinister as it was professional, authorities said. He cut phone lines and listened to a police scanner. He generally picked homes of people he thought were wealthy and vulnerable. He told investigators that he was inspired by the movie "Bullet," starring Mickey Rourke and Tupac Shakur.
In a meeting with authorities, Scott admitted to burglarizing at least 28 homes and invading nine while residents were there, court records show. He also admitted to molesting a 17-year-old girl during one home invasion and burglarizing a Woodbine, Md., gun shop, so he could sell the weapons.
The burglary of the gun shop first put federal investigators on Scott's tail as a suspect in the slayings. Before that, police barely knew he existed. He was living quietly in a modest suburban colonial in Largo, and public records show just one breach of the law: a speeding ticket. 
But soon after the slayings, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agents caught him trying to sell weapons from the gun shop burglary to an informant. That allowed police to raid his home and pull back the layers of his life, revealing what authorities allege was a rapid escalation from burglary to home invasion to murder. 
In court Tuesday, Scott wore an orange jail jump-suit. He had grown a patchy beard and had lost significant weight. When he spoke, he did so in a soft voice. 
Kobie Flowers, Scott's attorney, said his client is gay and exaggerated his criminal behavior to investigators because he was struggling with his personal identity. 
Scott's family members declined to comment. In letters written to the judge, they said Scott was ambitious and cared about others. He worked at UPS and had or was pursuing more than one college degree, according to the letters.  
"I know Jason was convicted of some serious crimes, but I still love him unconditionally. . . . I believe he possesses the ability and will to learn from this ordeal and work to better himself," his mother, Barbara Scott, wrote.

Too much cute takes sting out

BYLINE: Peter Marks

SECTION: STYLE; Pg. C01

LENGTH: 886 words

Renee Calarco is onto something when she suggests in her new play, "The Religion Thing," that America's biggest taboo isn't talking about sex - or even, as plays such as "Clybourne Park" might have it, race. No, it's talking about faith.
The uncomfortable silences that sometimes follow a public confession of devoutness are reproduced amusingly in this world-premiere comedy, which had its official opening Monday night in Theater J's Goldman Theater. Now, if Calarco would only trust her premise and cut some of the clunkier conceits in this overreaching effort, she might see her way clear to a taut, provocative satire. In downshifting too often from sociological insight to ill-advised bursts of magic realism and other cutesyness, "The Religion Thing" squanders much of its comic momentum. 
The play, directed by the dramatist's brother, Joe Calarco, launches Theater J's Locally Grown festival, an important new showcase for District playwrights. Over the next two months, the company will present readings of works by four other writers from the region, as well as several performances of "The Prostate Dialogues," a new solo piece by Baltimore-based Jon Spelman.
A company of Theater J's level of visibility diverting this much energy to the city's dramatic voices is a milestone. On the heels of Arena Stage's recruitment of District playwright Karen Zacarias as one of its resident writers, the Locally Grown festival is opening another channel for area dramatists seeking a route to more frequent and prominent productions.
Would one want the first fully staged festival offering to be a hit? Naturally. But a piece that's still finding itself will also do. Let "The Religion Thing" be the impetus for a more sustained contemplation of the D.C. theater community's collective will to nourish locally grown or groomed writing talent, to invest some resources into it in a more systematic way and see what benefits accrue, for artists and audiences.
The consequences of religiously mixed marriages have been a staple of comedy since the  "Abie's Irish Rose" in the '20s. As intermarriage has become more common, the guidelines for worship have grown blurrier in many families. As "The Religion Thing" posits, some couples of differing religious backgrounds find the topic so fraught these days that their solution is to expel God from the household altogether.
Calarco concerns herself with two Washington couples who could be charitably described as completely mixed up about faith. Mo (Liz Mamana), a lawyer, and Brian (Chris Stezin), a lobbyist, are so out of religious sync that, because she's Catholic and he's Jewish and neither is willing to give any ground, they've held off having kids, to Mo's despair. (That neither is religiously observant - or the least bit spiritual - makes their obstinacy on this point more confounding and also somehow comprehensible.)
Insofar as "The Religion Thing" is concerned, Mo and Brian articulate a far more mainstream dilemma than do the other couple: Kimberly Gilbert's Patti, a lawyer and lifelong friend of Mo's, and Patti's new love interest, yet another lawyer, Will Gartshore's Jeff. To spill many more beans would be unfair, but it is crucial to note that Jeff is a born-again Christian and that Patti, who apparently led quite the wild dating life, is masquerading as born-again to hold onto the seemingly straight-shooting Jeff.
While other charades in their relationship are pivotal to the unfolding complications of "The Religion Thing," Patti's motives are, through no fault of the talented Gilbert, the most difficult to unravel. (Then again, Jeff turns out to be quite a piece of work, too.) The recounting of their spiritual conjoining, revealed to a stunned Brian and Mo at a dinner party early in Act 1, sets up some of the play's funniest revelations. (Mamana's skeptical Mo gets the evening's choicest ripostes when she tries to shock Patti back to reality.)
The play, to its credit, tries awfully hard not to paint Jeff as a fanatic. It helps that Gartshore has been cast here, because he makes Jeff's reasoning for some of his suspect decisions plausible: You never doubt that he believes what he's saying. That's why it's all the more disappointing when the playwright undermines her story with a series of coarse, sketch-comedy vignettes that purport to be the cathartic dreams and/or hallucinations of the four main characters. Portraying the carnal or moral catalyst in each of these unfunny sequences is Joseph Thornhill, who looks as ill at ease through it all as I felt.
It becomes difficult to see past these scenes - as well as a prologue in a comedy club that feels equally vestigial - to an easy view of how this is all meant to fit together. As a result, the actors trudge a bit haltingly through all of the exposition. Even James Kronzer's carousel set reinforces the cumulative sense on this evening that we, like the characters of "The Religion Thing," are doomed to go around in circles.

Death and mayhem: Gadzooks!

BYLINE: Jessica Goldstein

SECTION: STYLE; Pg. C03

LENGTH: 1003 words

"Little Murders," a satire by Jules Feiffer set in an alternate-reality New York City, takes place in the home of the dysfunctional Newquist family. Horrific violence rages just outside their door. Gunshots can be heard constantly; the terror-trifecta of mugging, mayhem and murder threatens to engulf the Newquists' barely stable existence. 
So, just a lighthearted afternoon at the theater. Bring your kids! 
Ellen Dempsey, directing her seventh show with American Century Theater, described the tone of the play as "much more towards the 'Heathers' side" (citing, for the sadly uninitiated, a hilarious movie in which teenagers kill one another). "The violence comes and it's shocking, but you're in this world that isn't completely real, so it's hard to take it tragically. . . . It's a black comedy. Some people are going to laugh and some aren't."
"It's an exaggerated world where, literally, you cannot go outside on the streets of New York without being mugged or shot at or stabbed or beat up," said Emily Morrison, who plays Marjorie Newquist, family matriarch. "It's just the way of everyday life, and it's getting worse."
The play is set in the interior of the family's apartment, and the danger outside creeps through the crevices via sound effects.
What's most stunning to Dempsey about the play, which was written more than 40 years ago, is its prescience. "It's a good comment on the times we're living in: There's violence around. It reminds me of . . . when the D.C. sniper was out, the things that people would do . . . because there was random violence out there."
Morrison agreed. "There's a part in the play where the father . . . is talking about what we need to protect us. We need cameras in every elevator and doorway, in every shop. From 1967, it's Big Brother looking forward. Except for lobotomies given to people who don't make more than $10,000 a year, most of what [he predicts] has happened to us."
Friday to Feb. 11, Gunston Theatre Two, 2700 S. Lang St., Arlington, 703-998-4555, americancentury.org.

Crazy, stupid love
Director P.J. Paparelli is amplifying the teen angst factor in Shakespeare Theatre Company's "Two Gentlemen of Verona" (opening Tuesday), a show he cites as "a version of 'Romeo and Juliet' that isn't a tragedy."
"Two Gentlemen" "is one of Shakespeare's earliest plays," Paparelli said. "And it definitely deals with . . . the unbridled passion of teenagers, the crazy, impulsive and dangerous decisions they make, especially when adults aren't around to help guide things."
The previous two shows Paparelli did in the District, in 2005, were similarly themed: "Romeo and Juliet," a cautionary tale for love-crazy adolescents everywhere, and "Columbinus," a documentary play inspired by the 1999 shootings at Columbine High School.
"When you look at ['Two Gentlemen'] on the page, of course, it seems crazy, the things they do to each other," he said. "But when you think about teenage behavior . . .  they haven't quite formed the understanding of the consequences of their actions." The sorts of things that happen in "Two Gentlemen" - a girl coming between two lifelong friends, a relationship imploding over a misunderstanding - are things "that happen every day in high school."
"What we've done is try to look at the actual given circumstances of kids today . . . and how this behavior [in the play] is grounded in real situations."
The most difficult scene to navigate, Proteus's attempted rape (or committed rape, depending on one's interpretation) of Sylvia, is a work in progress. "We've looked at it many, many ways," said Paparelli. "I think it's more about the pain that has been inflicted on [Proteus] by this unrequited love, and he wants to inflict it on [her].
"Shakespeare is about pushing somebody to that point: How can you forgive somebody after they've done something really terrible? . . . It's a very big moment, what happens. The next two, three minutes of stage time, I think the audience is going to be quite shocked."
Tuesday to March 4, Lansburgh Theatre, 450 Seventh St. NW, 202-547-1122, shakespearetheatre.org.

Fight club
In Faction of Fools' "Romeo and Juliet," opening Thursday, Eva Wilhelm plays four characters and, in an envy-inspiring twist, gets two sword fights. 
"I'm almost jealous of me for having two sword fights!" she said. "As a woman, there are a lot of us who are certified in stage combat. I'm certified in seven weapons. . . . And most of the time, we [women] maybe get to do a slap. . . . It's just so refreshing to put all of that training to use." 
The production, she said, is big on action. "I think so many people have a misguided idea of Shakespeare as a very static, very - [at this she adopted a mock-dramatic, booming voice] 'We stand around and we declare poetry to each other and walk dramatically!' What surprised me the most is . . . how much the story is helped by all of this action. It's really astonishing."
Five actors share all the parts in Faction's production, switching masks and costumes to distinguish among roles, and the show comes in at a 70 -minute clip. Matt Wilson, the director, has been envisioning the project for about 10 years.
Keeping in the tradition of commedia dell'arte, the characters will wear half-masks, covering the top of the face but leaving the mouth free to speak. 
In addition to highlighting the action, Faction's show brings out some unexpected humor. For instance, when Juliet's family thinks she's dead, "it's hilarious!" insisted Wilhelm. "It's so overdone. . . . If you really read through it, it's got all these, 'O woe! O lamentable day!' It's just maniacal in a way." The language, she explained, crosses over from drama to melodrama to borderline ridiculous, suggesting Shakespeare's intent was to get a laugh from the audience, who, knowing Juliet is still alive, would be in on the joke.
"I knew the text was funny,"  Wilson said. "I didn't realize how funny it was."
Thursday to Feb. 4, Mead Theatre Lab at Flashpoint, 916 G St. NW, factionoffools.org.

N.H. win reveals a liability for Romney

BYLINE: Philip Rucker

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A05

LENGTH: 1119 words

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H.

MANCHESTER, N.H. - The Mitt Romney who campaigned across New Hampshire the past few days entered the workforce"at the bottom," feared getting "a pink slip," doesn't ownfour houses (although he thinks "that's a good idea") and "never imagined" he would run for office because, as he put it, "I was just a high school kid like everybody else with skinny legs."
There's nothing wholly false about the ways Romney has been describing himself. But the descriptions don't ring true, either. 
As Romney heads to South Carolina hoping to polish off his rivals after Tuesday's primary victory, there may be lasting damage from his week of campaigning in New Hampshire. In trying to correct a weakness - some critics have called it inauthenticity - Romney may have only amplified it. 
By Monday, the candidate himself seemed to have realized as much.
"If you think I should spend my entire campaign carefully choosing how everything I say relates to people, as opposed to saying my own experience and telling my own experience, that would make me a very different person than I am," Romney told reporters at a sometimes testy news conference. "I'm going to tell people my own experiences in life, and I realize they're not the same as everyone else I speak with, but I'm going to tell you about myself and if people like that, great."
The Mitt Romney Americans have come to know through his five-year quest for the presidency was the miracle baby of an auto industry titan who went from a private boys preparatory school in a tony Detroit suburb to Harvard Business School. The country's best consulting firms fought to hire him, and within a few short years he was the one doing the hiring. 
Just a couple of years ago, Romney did own four houses, but after the 2008 election he downsized to three, including a San Diego beach house he is planning to more than double. In December, he was shopping with his wife, Ann, whotold reportersthat her favorite Christmas present from her husband was a horse.
America knows Romney not as an aw-shucks, reluctant citizen-politician but as a conscientious scion who worshiped his father, George, the three-term Michigan governor and onetime presidential candidate who long ago groomed young Mitt for high office. "He was teaching me how to get out there," Romney told Time in 2007.
Around the edges in New Hampshire this past week, the former Massachusetts governor tried to convey everyman sensibilities and experiences. But to voters who already had judged Romney a slippery, stiff and distant politician, the reality he tried to create here didn't seem real.
"I've been aware of Romney for a lot of years," said Alan Riley, 60, a retired systems support engineer from Goffstown, N.H., who voted for former U.S. senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania. "You sometimes wondered when he was governor, who died and made him king? And he didn't think he was a king. He thought he was God."
Patricia Ryan, 64, a retired teacher here, said she was a Democrat but deeply disappointed in President Obama and open to supporting a Republican. Of Romney, she said: "He's okay. I'm not afraid of him like I am some Republicans. But I think he's so rich he has no idea what it means to work hard and support yourself."
Romney's remarks Sunday - "I know what it's like to worry whether you're going to get fired; there were a couple of times I wondered whether I was going to get a pink slip" - distracted from his campaign's message about fixing the economy. This could follow him to South Carolina, which hosts the next primary, on Jan. 21, and where he is not the overwhelming favorite that he was in New Hampshire. Opponents have seizedon the "pink slip" comment to portray Romney as a corporate predator. But Romney's aides point to his strong victory in New Hampshire as evidence that his comments this past week do not undermine his standing with voters.
Romney seems at his most uncomfortable when he's talking about himself, and he does not easily reveal details about his life.
At times, Romney has exaggerated. In 2007, he said during a New Hampshire campaign stop: "I purchased a gun when I was a young man. I've been a hunter pretty much all my life." But, as his spokesman later clarified, Romney had hunted only twice: for rabbits in Idaho with some cousins when he was a teenager and for quail with Republican donors at a Georgia game preserve in 2006.
Aubrey Immelman, director of the Unit for the Study of Personality in Politics at St. John's University in Minnesota, said Romney may be overcompensating for his inability to connect with regular people.
"Romney is neither an introvert nor an extrovert," said Immelman, who has done personality studies of elected leaders including former presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. "The key is in his conscientiousness. . . . People that are highly conscientious are just not good campaigners. He might be a good executive - and he may end up being a fine president - but campaigning is his Achilles' heel."
Romney's main line of attack against his chief opponents - Santorum, former House speaker Newt Gingrich and Texas Gov. Rick Perry - is that they are all "career politicians." Romney often tells audiences: "There's nothing wrong with that, but it's a very different background than I have."
"I only spent four years in government. I didn't inhale," Romney often jokes. "I'm still a business guy."
Romney likes to tell audiences that his wife made him run, that she feared the nation's rising debt and sputtering economy and believed he was the only person who could turn it all around. Never mind that he published a campaign book, "No Apology," in 2010, and spent the years after his 2008 loss traveling the country helping Republicans and, in turn, collecting political IOUs.
"Why in the world am I in this?" Romney asked at a spaghetti dinner last week in Tilton, N.H. "I turned to Ann and I said, 'You know, you pushed me to get in this again.' And she said, 'You're right!' "
Two days later, at a rally inside the ornate opera house in Rochester, N.H., Romney said: "This chance to run for president of the United States, I never imagined I'd do it. This is just a very strange and unusual thing to be in the middle of.
"I was just a high school kid like everybody else with skinny legs," Romney added. "And, you know, I imagined that I'd be, you know, in business all my career. And somehow I backed into the chance to do this."

Flags fly at half-staff for fatally shot park ranger

BYLINE: Ed O'Keefe

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B04

LENGTH: 142 words

Flags flew at half-staff across the national park system Tuesday as friends and colleagues gathered to remember Margaret Anderson, the first female park ranger killed in the line of duty. 
Anderson was killed Jan. 1 by a gunman in Mount Rainier National Park in Washington state. A massive search for the shooter began, and he was later found dead.
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, National Park Service Director Jon Jarvis and Gov. Chris Gregoire (D) attended Tuesday's service at Pacific Lutheran University, near Tacoma. Salazar ordered the agency's flags across the country to fly at half-staff in Anderson's honor.
Anderson, 34, is survived by her husband, who is also a park ranger, and two young children. The National Park Foundation, a private charitable organization, has established a memorial fund to benefit her children.

Court criticizes conduct of La. prosecutors

BYLINE: Robert Barnesby Robert Barnes

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A03

LENGTH: 583 words

The Supreme Court on Tuesday overturned a Louisiana man's murder conviction in its latest evaluation of whether prosecutors in New Orleanswithhold evidence to win convictions.
In an 8 to 1 rulingwritten by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., the court said prosecutors who worked for former district attorney Harry Connick Sr. should have turned over to defense lawyers statements from one of the survivors of a 1995 shooting rampage that left five dead.
Larry Boatner was the sole witness against Juan Smith, who was convicted of five counts of first-degree murder. But it was not until lawyers were working on Smith's appeal that they discovered documents in which Boatner initially said he could not identify any of the men involved in the shootings. 
Since the court's 1963 decision inBrady v. Maryland, prosecutors are obligated to turn over evidence that is favorable to the defense and material to the defendant's guilt or punishment. New Orleans prosecutors argued that the documents were favorable to the defense but would not have changed the jury's decision.
During oral arguments in November,the justices derided the prosecutors' case, and Tuesday's four-page opinion indicated that it had been an easy decision for them.
"Boatner's testimony was the only evidence linking Smith to the crime," Roberts wrote. "Boatner's undisclosed statements were plainly material."
Justice Clarence Thomas wrote the lone dissent, complaining that the other justices did not look at the complete record of the trial in making their decision.
New Orleans prosecutors said immediately after the court's decision that they will seek to retry Smith, who has also been convicted of a triple murder and is on death row.
Thomas last year wrote the majority opinion in another caseinvolving Connick, who left office in 2003. In that 5 to 4 decision, the court stripped a $14 million award from John Thompson, who spent 14 years on death row after prosecutors withheld evidence that showed his innocence.
Thomas, joined by the court's other conservatives, said that Thompson did not meet the high standard of showing a pattern of "deliberate indifference" on Connick's part.
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, on behalf of the court's liberals, read her dissent from the bench in that case, saying she would have upheld the award against Connick's office for the "gross, deliberately indifferent and long-continuing violation of [Thompson's] fair trial right."
Smith's lawyers point out that courts have overturned four death sentences from Orleans Parish because of violations of the Brady rules, and they say eight other non-capital cases have come to the same end.
The case is Smith v. Cain.
In a separate 8 to 1 decision, the court said that consumerswho are unhappy about allegedly hidden costs in the credit cards they receive from "credit repair" companies must settle their claims through arbitration.
Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the courtthat language in the Credit Repair Organizations Act that says consumers have a "right to sue" is satisfied by the agreement they sign that says disputes will be handed by arbitration.
Ginsburg, the lone dissenter, said that such a reading "may be comprehensible to one trained to 'think like a lawyer.' "
"But Congress enacted the CROA with vulnerable consumers in mind - consumers likely to read the words 'right to sue' to mean the right to litigate in court, not the obligation to submit disputes to binding arbitration."
The case is CompuCredit Corp. v. Greenwood.

Killing of Silver Spring rapper still unsolved

BYLINE: Aaron Kraut

SECTION: METRO; Pg. T15

LENGTH: 565 words

Franklin Amobi, known to many rap fans as Frank Diggy, wanted to make a change when he first met promoter Huwey Kelly about a year ago.
Amobi, 24, had a series of drug arrests, but the Silver Spring man also had a promising musical career, something Kelly said he hoped would motivate him to change his ways.
On Dec. 27, Amobi was found shot to death on Stewart Lane in Silver Spring, near the same White Oak apartments he used in some of his rap videos, many of which can be found on YouTube and other music Web sites. Friends said they don't know why Amobi was killed, and Montgomery County police said they don't know why he was targeted. 
"What happened to him was really crazy," Kelly said. "It really hurts. Everybody's still trying to figure it out."
Police responded to reports of gunfire around 6:45 a.m. Dec. 27 in the 11400 block of Stewart Lane and found Amobi dead from multiple gunshot wounds to the upper torso. Amobi lived in the nearby Enclave Apartments on Columbia Pike, police said.
Chico Kelly, who is unrelated to Huwey Kelly, became friends with Amobi when the two met in seventh grade at Glenmont Alternative Middle School, a public school for students with attendance or behavior issues. They eventually became rap partners. Chico Kelly was featured on Amobi's "Get Out The Way," a track from the mix tape Amobi released last summer.
" [Nobody knows] what the situation is really about. All we can do is wait for the circumstances to unfold," Chico Kelly said. "He didn't bother nobody. He was a very humble dude. All he wanted to do was get his music out there. That's what we were working toward."
Chico Kelly said the two planned to buy a house together and focus on their rap careers. Both Huwey Kelly and Chico Kelly characterized Amobi as a well-known figure in the local rap scene. He had a release party for his fourth mix tape, titled "Better Wit Time," in July at the Cuzco Restaurant bar and nightclub in Hyattsville and performed throughout the area.
In December 2006, Amobi was sentenced to eight years in prison for drug distribution. He served 2 1 / 2 years and upon his release violated parole when he was charged with possession of marijuana, which led to three months of supervised probation.
Police said they do not know if Amobi's criminal history had anything to do with his death.
"There is not much information because cooperation has been limited," said Lt. Michael Price of the 3rd District Montgomery County Police Department last week. "This man was involved in a myriad of things, from his criminal arrest record to his aspiring rap profession."
On "Ball Like Rondo," one of his most popular tracks and an ode to Boston Celtics point guard Rajon Rondo, Amobi raps about money and his lifestyle. Frank Diggy's YouTube page is full of R.I.P. messages, as is his Facebook fan page, where somebody offered $20 Frank Diggy T-shirts to benefit the Amobi family. Huwey Kelly said he's having a party to honor his friend on Feb. 3 at the Pashion Restaurant and Lounge in Wheaton, where he hosts a rap showcase. 
"I felt he was a really smart person who wanted to take his career and his business somewhere else. But he was a really quiet guy, very laid back. He was a hard worker who knew how to play his position," Huwey Kelly said. "The only time he was really loud was on the stage. You could tell it was really about to jump off for him."

Marines investigating video depicting abuse of corpses

BYLINE: Craig Whitlock

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A11

LENGTH: 439 words

The Marine Corps said Wednesday that it is investigating the origins of a video on the Internet that purports to show Marines in combat gear urinating on the corpses of three Taliban insurgents. 
The video, less than a minute long, began circulating on Web sites early Wednesday. It depicts four Marines laughing as they relieve themselves while standing over three prostrate bodies. 
A caption says the service members are part of a scout sniper team with the 3rd Battalion, 2nd Marines, an infantry unit from Camp Lejeune, N.C. Marines in the unit were deployed to Afghanistan last year but returned in September.
Capt. Kendra N. Hardesty, a Marine Corps spokeswoman, said officials would "fully investigate" the matter but so far have been unable to verify the video's authenticity or whether Marines in the battalion were involved.
"The actions portrayed are not consistent with our core values and are not indicative of the character of the Marines in our Corps," she said in a statement.
There was no way to determine independently where the video was filmed or the identities of those involved. 
A caption refers to the corpses as "dead Talibans," but it was unclear whether they were civilians or fighters killed after a battle. The bodies are dressed in Afghan-style clothing; one male corpse's chest appears to be soaked in blood.
Digital video and photography have grown more common on the battlefield, and many amateur productions wind up on the Internet. On occasion, the trend has caused severe embarrassment for the U.S. military, or in rare cases, such as the Abu Ghraib prison scandal in Iraq, triggered international controversy and legal action against those involved.The Pentagon has sent mixed messages on social media, reviewing troops' blogs for inappropriate content and classified information while encouraging units and commanders to communicate on Facebook. In embracing social media, the Pentagon has effectively acknowledged that it simply cannot stop the flood of data and images from the battlefield.
In 2010, members  of the 5th Stryker Combat Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division, posed with corpses of Afghan civilians gunned down by a self-described "kill team" of rogue soldiers. In that case, as it has not always been able to do, the Army confiscated hundreds of photographs and kept them out of the public domain for months. 
A few were later obtained and published last March by two news magazines - Rolling Stone and Der Spiegel, a German publication - but the impact was muted. Unlike the purported video of the Marines, those photos did not depict troops in the act of desecrating corpses.

Republicans take reins of Va. General Assembly

BYLINE: Anita Kumarand Laura Vozzella;Laura Vozzella

DATELINE: RICHMOND

RICHMOND - Republicans seized control of an equally divided Senate on the first day of theGeneral Assemblysession Wednesday, relying on arcane maneuvers to take over the last part of the state government they didn't already control.
All Democrats could do was deliver speeches about fairness and threaten to go to court- again. 
It was a sharp contrast from 1996, the last time the chamber was split 20-20 and both parties agreed to share power - albeit only because a Democrat threatened to defect if his party didn't. The Republicans' carefully calibrated legislative maneuvers on Wednesday were more emblematic of the partisanship that has surfaced on both sides in Congress as well as in other state legislatures, such as in Ohio and Wisconsin.
"This is not a power grab. This is a re-articulation on this side of the aisle of the Senate rules as we see appropriate," Sen. Thomas K. Norment (R-James City), the new majority leader, told Democrats. "If you chose not to accept the legislative hand of friendship, I would be disappointed."
Democrats disagreed. "What is happening is the systematic dismantling of rules that could be used to help us rule in a fair way," Sen. Mark R. Herring (Loudoun) said.
Republicans also hold a 68-seat majority in the 100-member House of Delegates - the highest in Virginia history, giving the party sway over the General Assembly and the governor's mansion for only the second time since the Civil War.
By day's end, the GOP had acquired greater power through a raft of rule changes that not only mean they chair all committees but also allow them to have greater say over school funding, transportation and social issues, among others. Republicans now have the votes to approve legislation that would limit abortions and ease gun laws, moves that were previously blocked by Senate Democrats.
Republicans and Democrats have been fighting over control of the Senate since the GOP picked up two seats in November's elections, leaving the chamber with 20 Republicans and 20 Democrats. Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling, a Republican, can cast tie breaking votes, tilting power to the GOP.
Sen. A. Donald McEachin (D-Richmond) filed a lawsuit in December seeking to block Bolling from voting on certain matters, including questions of Senate organization. A Richmond Circuit Court judge turned down his request for an injunction.
McEachin, a lawyer who has led the Democrats' effort to thwart a GOP takeover, told reporters Wednesday that his lawyers were "on standby," but at the end of the day Democrats had not gone to court. "Stay tuned,'' he said.
In his annual State of the Commonwealth address on Wednesday night, Gov. Robert F. McDonnell (R) urged legislators to be civiland thanked Senate Democrats for their passionate and statesman-like argument.
"This session, we must remember that while seating charts and committee assignments may have changed, the Virginia Way cannot. To the members in the majority I say: Don't be arrogant. Don't overreach. To the members in the minority: Don't be angry. Don't obstruct. To all of us: Let's be civil and productive,'' he told them.
Legislators will spend much of the session considering thousands of bills and passing an $85 billion, two-year budget. But Wednesday was marked by pomp and circumstance in the historic, white-columned structure reverently referred to as "Mr. Jefferson's Capitol'' as members spent most of the day awaiting the fight over control in the Senate.
The House welcomed 15 new delegates, and the Senate six new members. Family and friends of the newly elected crowded into the ornate chambers, along with retiring members, including Sen. Mary Margaret Whipple (D-Arlington).
The newly sworn-in legislators proceeded with the niceties of a new session, with veterans rising to formally introduce freshmen  and their spouses, children and other relatives.
House delegates unanimously reelected William J. Howell (R-Stafford) as speaker. He promptly announced the shuffling of committee assignments - one of the most anticipated announcements, as a new session begins - which are based on proportion to the entire body.
The day kicked off with a prayer breakfast at the Richmond convention center attended by about 1,000 and headlined by McDonnell, Bolling and Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli II (R).
Prayers were offered for lawmakers and others, including Virginia's judiciary, which is likely to be drawn into the Senate battle.
A few dozen protesters rallied in the rain off Capitol Square, saying they hoped to remind legislators to represent their constituents, not lobbyists and campaign donors. They chanted and held homemade signs that said: "Listen to Voters . . . We are Virginia.''
Among the rule changes Republicans are pushing: doing away with a requirement that committee membership reflect, as nearly as possible, the proportional party makeup of the Senate as a whole.
An even more arcane but potentially consequential change would remove a requirement that motions be phrased in the affirmative. That way, a motion cast in the negative that failed on a tie vote could still bring about the same result as a motion passed in the affirmative.
"Even a non-math major like myself can figure out that 20-20 means equally divided,'' Sen. J. Chapman "Chap" Petersen (D-Fairfax) said.
The last time the chamber was equally divided, Democrats, who had 20 senators and the lieutenant governor, intended to rely on that tie-breaking vote to control the chamber. But Sen. Virgil H. Goode Jr., a Democrat who later switched parties while serving in Congress, would not agree to the reorganization unless Republicans shared power in the chamber. The two parties shared control for four years.
Senators spent hours Wednesday arguing over the legality of Bolling's vote, but Norment said he would not engage in a constitutional debate on the floor.
During the past few weeks, the squabbling already prompted the clerk to postpone decisions on office space and seating arrangements in the chamber. It even delayed the selection of which schoolchildren would serve as pages.
"We are going to try to work cooperatively and fairly, but we are not going to abdicate the responsibility given to us by the voters of Virginia,'' Norment said.

Police suspect same pair in D.C., Md. thefts

BYLINE: Mary Pat Flaherty

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B01

LENGTH: 983 words

Police in the District and Montgomery County say they suspect that the same pair of armed men may be responsible for as many as 12 street robberies since late November in Upper Northwest and within blocks of the Bethesda-District line near Western Avenue.
Many of the robberies have occurred in the early evening, when people are taking walks or arriving home. The robberies, in an area that includes upscale shops and restaurants, have residents on edge. 
A robbery about 7 p.m. Wednesday on Western at Chevy Chase Circle follows that pattern, authorities said.
Samantha Nolan of the Chevy Chase neighborhood in the District said the brazenness of the robberies is "very disconcerting." Doing three stickups within minutes and then returning to the same neighborhood is "very bold" and suggests that the robbers don't have much fear, she said. 
The robberies come as a housekeeper was sexually assaulted and a mother and teenage son were tied up during a home invasion in Bethesda on Wednesday morning. Montgomery County police say the incident involves the same man who committed a Tuesday home invasion in Wheaton. Police linked those incidents Wednesday afternoon, but say they are unrelated to the robberies.
Before Wednesday night, the most recent related robbery occurred about 9:20 p.m. Tuesday, when a woman walking in the 4100 block of Livingston Street NW was robbed at gunpoint of her purse and cellphone, D.C. police said.
The woman told police that she noticed a man hiding in the tree line on the south side of the street. When she tried to cross to avoid him, she told police, the suspect ran to her and robbed her.
The robberies are not like the crimes that targeted iPhones and cellphones last year, police said. The suspects in the recent events usually show guns and have taken purses, briefcases and wallets, police said,
 "We can't say definitely these are all the same suspects because no one has been caught, but there are enough similarities that we are looking on them as linked," said Cmdr. George Kucik, head of the D.C. police criminal investigations division.
Capt. David Falcinelli, commander of the Bethesda district for Montgomery County, said two robberies on Nov. 22 and Dec. 26 near the Bethesda border with the District also are believed to be part of the pattern. Police are looking at links with at least three other robberies.
The Livingston Street robbery comes after three similar stickups within 30 minutes of one another early Sunday evening in Cleveland Park and Friendship Heights. D.C. police say theythink another four since Dec. 10 also share similar characteristics.
The robbers generally have hit between 6 and 11 p.m, police said. They have usually approached people who are walking alone or getting out of their cars. But there have been incidents in which two people were robbed together.
Victims often have been taken by surprise and sometimes were approached from behind, making descriptions of suspects difficult. "This probably doesn't take more than 30 seconds," Kucik said.
From the vague descriptions, police are looking for two men, both about 6 feet tall and in their 20s to 30s, who mask their faces with a scarf or jacket hood. The suspects have displayed guns in the District incidents, D.C. police say. A gun was shown in at least one of the Bethesda robberies, Falcinelli said.
The robbers usually tell their victims to walk in one direction while they flee in the other. Kucik said they suspect an escape vehicle has been nearby, and have one report of a dark blue car being involved. "But we know people often use stolen cars and switch them out once they get too hot," Kucik said.
The two departments say they have ramped up police visibility and patrols, but also have taken more covert steps that they declined to detail.
Kucik said police urge anyone who is approached to cooperate. "No one has been injured thus far and we do not want to see that happen," he said.
Police also are asking residents to be aware of their surroundings and to call police if they see a car or activity that seems suspicious, he added. "Maybe it's innocent but we would rather make contact with a person and find out there is a legitimate reason for them to be in an area."
The latest of the unrelated home invasions began about 6:45 a.m. Wednesday when a housekeeper who had just arrived for work in the 9200 block of Bardon Road went outside to move her car and found a man at the front door, police say. The suspect pulled a gun and forced the woman into the house, police said. He then tied up the housekeeper, the homeowner and the homeowner's son, and assaulted the housekeeper.
The suspect stole a debit card and the keys to the housekeeper's Ford Expedition, which he used to flee, according to police. The stolen card later was used at a CVS in L'Enfant Plaza in the District, police said.
Detectives linked the Bethesda robbery to a home invasion that occurred about 10 a.m. Tuesday in the 2900 block of McMahon Road in Wheaton. There, a woman had entered her home's garage when the suspect approached with a gun and demanded money, which the woman pulled from her wallet, police said.
The man then demanded the victim's debit card, PIN number and car keys, police said. The robber fled in the victim's car and later used her stolen card at a bank ATM in Oxon Hill, according to police.
The suspect in both robberies is described by police as a black man in his late 20s to early 30s, 5 feet 7 inches tall, with a slim build. He was wearing a black jacket, a sweatshirt with pockets in the front, dark-colored pants and brown-framed eyeglasses, police said. He wore a black ski mask and gloves, police said.
After the Bethesda home invasion, the suspect fled in the gray Ford Expedition with Maryland tags 4AE7450.  The vehicle has a McDaniel College sticker on the rear windshield.

Ex-police officer gets 90 days in sting case 
A former D.C. police officer was sentenced to 90 days in jail after pleading guilty to attempting to receive stolen property in December, authorities said.
Silvestre Bonilla, 31, was sentenced Wednesday in D.C. Superior Court, according to the U.S. attorney's office. 
Judge Bruce S. Mencher suspended a further 90 days on the condition that Bonilla complete a year of probation.
Bonilla, a seven-year veteran of the force, resigned this week, authorities said. He was one of three officers arrested on the same day in March 2011 as part of a sting operation involving stolen goods.

State school system receives a B-plus
Maryland's public school system achieved top-in-the-nation status for the fourth straight year, according to an analysis of state education policies and student achievement released Thursday.
The state was given an overall grade of B-plus by Education Week, which publishes the annual report. The average grade for the nation was a C. Virginia came in fourth with a B. The District, rated alongside states, had an overall grade of C-minus.
The evaluation includes dozens of indicators of student achievement, academic standards and accountability, teacher quality, and school finance.
"Maryland is an example of an all-around strong performer," said Chris Swanson, a vice president at Editorial Projects in Education, which publishes Education Week.

French journalist among 8 killed by blast in Syria

BYLINE: Liz Sly

LENGTH: 695 words

DATELINE: THE DEATH OF GILLES JACQUIER, 43, OF THE FRANCE2 TELEVISION NETWORK, WAS SEIZED ON BY BOTH SIDES AS EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THEIR DUELING NARRATIVES.

BEIRUT - A mortar attack in the restive Syrian city of Homs killed at least eight people Wednesday, including a French cameraman who became the first Western journalist to die in the violence engulfing the country's 10-month-old uprising.
Hours earlier, President Bashar al-Assad had made his second public appearance in as many days, turning up unexpectedly at a demonstration in central Damascus to promise his supporters that the revolt will soon be crushed. 
The death of Gilles Jacquier, 43, who worked for the France 2 television network, was quickly seized on by both sides in the conflict as evidence to support their dueling narratives.
Jacquier, a veteran of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, was traveling with a group of journalists on an official government tour when three mortar rounds or rockets exploded near their vehicle in the staunchly pro-regime Ikrima neighborhood of Homs. The victims were among 28 people killed Wednesday across Syria, 13 in Homs, according to the Syrian Revolution General Commission, an opposition group that organizes and monitors anti-government demonstrations.
Homs has emerged as the uprising's violent epicenter, a patchwork of pro- and anti-regime neighborhoods in which residents on both sides have taken up arms. Hundreds have died there since the revolt erupted last March, including protesters shot dead by security forces at anti-government demonstrations, civilians killed in government shelling of opposition strongholds and, in recent months, security forces and government supporters attacked by armed members of the opposition.
But the circumstances and timing of Tuesday's attack highlighted the murky complexities of the escalating violence, with both sides trading accusations of responsibility.
The Syrian government said the attack offered proof that the opposition is armed and dangerous. According to the official SANA news agency, nine people died when an "armed terrorist group" fired the mortars as the journalists were interviewing residents and inspecting damage caused by previous attacks.
Opposition groups said it would have been impossible for the rebels to stage such an attack in the pro-regime neighborhood, populated mostly by members of the same Alawite minority as the president. A statement by the Homs Revolutionary Council accused the government of firing the rockets to "serve its own interests" and tarnish the reputation of the protest movement.
The grim aftermath was captured by the pro-government Al-Dunia television network, which showed cameramen rushing to the scene of one explosion when another mortar round explodes, leaving at least three people crumpled on the ground. The footage then shows the body of the French journalist stuffed into the back of a taxi.
Few Western journalists have been granted access to Syria since the uprising began, but in recent days, the government has begun issuing visas, in part to comply with the terms of an Arab League peace initiative that calls for the media to be admitted, along with other steps.
But the peace plan is clearly faltering amid evidence that the death toll has only risen since the dispatch of Arab monitors to observe the violence.
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said that the monitoring mission "should not continue indefinitely."
"We cannot permit Assad and his regime to have impunity," she told reporters during a visit to Washington by Qatari Prime Minister Hamad bin Jasim al-Thani, who has led the Arab effort to isolate and sanction Assad.
Assad's belligerent speech Monday, in which he pledged to crush the uprising with an "iron fist," further cast into doubt the sustainability of the mission. At his brief appearance in Ummayed Square in Damascus on Tuesday, he rallied thousands of supporters with promises that the government soon would triumph.
"We are going to win," said Assad, who was accompanied by his wife, Asmaa. "Now the conspiracy is dying . . . and it is the end of their plot."

A healthy gain for Children's

BYLINE: John Kelly

LENGTH: 741 words

We made a remarkable push in the last few days of this year's fundraising campaign for Children's National Medical Center, and if  we didn't quite reach our $400,000 goal, we   raised a very respectable amount: $327,861.32.
If you donated, thank you. I also want to thank the groups of area employees, neighbors, hobbyists, students and others who pooled their money for Children's. For the 44th year in a row, Lois Kelso Hunt and her neighbors in Alexandria's Shooter's Hill did "ecumenical caroling," raising $1,171 in memory of Lois's late son, Nathaniel. 
Each year a group of kids in Chevy Chase D.C. puts on an hour-long version of "A Christmas Carol" in the cafeteria of Blessed Sacrament School. They call themselves the Northampton Street Players and pass Scrooge's hat around to take a collection. This year they raised $531.25. God bless us, everyone! Here are other group donors (if I've omitted your group, let me know):
Disabled American Veterans, Washington office ($6,202.57)
United Airlines mechanics, Dulles ($795)
Air Line Pilots Association, International, Herndon and Washington offices ($886)
Montgomery Gentlemen ($200)
Women's Life Insurance Society, Unit 3 ($100)
Army Navy Country Club Duplicate Bridge Club ($150)
The MALL women's bridge group ($69)
Somerset Women's Bridge Club, Fairfax ($115)
Matthew 25 Fund, George Mason University's Catholic Campus Ministry, in memory of Jimmy O'Neill ($745)
McLean Monday Bridge Group ($125)
Wiley Rein LLP, Washington ($500)
Locke Lord LLP, Washington ($250)
Joyful Heart Yoga, Vienna ($760)
Garden Grooming, in memory of Sophie Bea Shimm ($435)
Management Analysis ($1,487.55)

Mrs. Forbrich's class, Lake Seneca Elementary School, Germantown ($150)
Colmar Manor Seniors Club ($100)
Laureate Kappa chapter of Beta Sigma Phi ($25)
Thanks also to my colleague Gerri Marmer, who handles the accounting on this end, and to the many Children's patients, parents, doctors and nurses who shared their stories. All of the money we raised goes to the hospital's uncompensated care fund.

A little more conversation
Will all doctors' assistants and waiters  please heed me? To wit:
Doctors' assistants, why when I go to my primary care physician and am shuttled into the examination room to await the MD, do you take my blood pressure, write it down and then refuse to tell me what it is? Is it a secret? Is it so high or so low that the mere mention of it will send me into shock? And waiters, why when you have rattled off that evening's dinner specials - seared, black pepper-encrusted ahi tuna with a watercress confit served atop a bed of field greens and drizzled with a reduction of Ovaltine - do you refuse  to tell me what it costs? Is it a secret? Is it so high or so low that the mere mention of it will send me into shock?
I think we're entitled to this information.

Winter wanderland

A sign outside 7-Eleven read, "Restrooms are available for customers," instead of what it reads at the height of summer: "Customers are strictly forbidden from using the restrooms."
In front of a miniature golf course: "Unlimited golf all day! Free ice cream!"
And on the marquee of a real estate office: "Give thanks to a market where prices are so low. Interest rates have never been this good."
Wonders Tony: "Can Memorial Day be that far away?"

Radio silence
I worked my way through college 30 years ago delivering pictures to Colorfax photo stores around the D.C. area. We delivery drivers had a fleet of Ford Pintos at our disposal, eventually upgraded to . . . Chevettes. The options extended no further than an AM radio in each car.
The only thing that kept me sane as I stewed in D.C. traffic each afternoon was listening to Bill Trumbull and Chris Core on WMAL. Theirs was a gently funny  program: Top 40 music and the sort of light, friendly banter that wouldn't last five minutes on today's WMAL, which is full of right-wing nutjobs unspooling their wacky conspiracy theories.
Trumbull died Tuesdayat 77. It was nice having him in the car with me all those years ago.

Founded Blackie's House of Beef in D.C.

BYLINE: Bart Barnes

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B07

LENGTH: 603 words

Lulu H. Auger, who with her husband founded and for more than a half-century ran one of Washington's best-known restaurants, Blackie's House of Beef, died Dec. 29 at Washington Hospital Center. She was 87.
She died after a stroke, said her son Gregory Auger. 
With Ulysses G. "Blackie" Auger, Mrs. Auger opened Blackie's in 1952 at 22nd and M streets NW in the West End neighborhood. It became one of the primary gathering places for political and business heavyweights, including former president Harry S. Truman, then-Sen. John F. Kennedy (D-Mass.), Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover and William "Fishbait" Miller, the famed doorkeeper of the House of Representatives. In 1959, the revolutionary Cuban leader Fidel Castro dined there with seven of his associates. 
"It was the site of countless marriage proposals and nervous prom-night feasts," The Washington Post observed when Blackie's closed on New Year's Eve 2005.
When the restaurant opened, its signature dish on a no-frills menu was a hefty prime rib of beef, baked potato, peas, salad and cheesecake, for $1.75. When the restaurant closed, the prime rib was $39, and there was an extensive wine list. 
For years, Blackie Auger's mantra was direct: "You eat beef or you don't eat nothing." But the words "House of Beef" were eventually dropped from its name, reflecting a diversified menu that had grown to include such delicacies as Chilean sea bass.
Mrs. Auger's role in the operation included hostess duties in the dining room. "My mom took care of the front of the house," Gregory Auger said. "My dad made sure the train ran on time."
Lulu Hansen, who lived in Washington, was born in Garden City, Minn., on Oct. 5, 1924, the ninth of 10 children of a Danish immigrant farmer. 
In the early years of World War II, she came to Washington on a Greyhound bus to look for work as a "Government Girl." One of the other passengers was Ulysses Auger; their romance began with a casual conversation. 
The future Mrs. Auger found work as a stenographer typist at the Treasury Department. Blackie Auger served as an Army Ranger during World War II. 
They were married for the first time Jan. 9, 1946, in Hollywood, Calif., at the Marriage Manor, a wedding chapel they found in the Yellow Pages. The wedding fee was $10: $5 for the officiating clergyman and $5 for a witness. 
But Ulysses Auger had always wanted to be married in a Greek Orthodox church. In spring 1958, after the couple's restaurant business was successfully established, Mrs. Auger was baptized into the Greek Orthodox faith. On May 28, they were married for the second time, at St. Sophia Greek Orthodox Cathedral in Washington. 
Ulysses Auger died in 2004. Their son, Ulysses G. Auger II, died in 2009.
Survivors include two children, Gregory Auger and Constandina Economides, both of Washington; and 10 grandchildren.
When her children reached school age, Mrs. Auger worked the luncheon shift at the restaurant but then went home midafternoon to take care of the family. Her husband remained at work until late.
They expanded their business interests to include part ownership of the Mayflower hotel and Madison National Bank, and they helped build a Marriott hotel atop the Blackie's building in 1981. They owned dozens of coffee shops and affiliated restaurants, including the Black Rose, the Black Saddle, the Black Bird, the Black Gun, the Black Russian and the Black Frisco.
In 1971, Mrs. Auger became an evangelical Christian, which she wrote about in a 2009 book, "Lulu: One Woman's Journey From Poverty and the Occult to Enduring Faith and True Riches."

S.D. governor also served in House

BYLINE: Bart Barnes

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B07

LENGTH: 826 words

William J.  Janklow, 72, the flamboyant former governor of South Dakota who served half a term in the House of Representatives before resigning in the wake of a fatal traffic accident, died Jan. 12 at a hospice in Sioux Falls, S.D. 
He had been hospitalized with brain cancer. His son, Russ Janklow, confirmed the death to the Associated Press. 
For more than a quarter-century, "Wild Bill" Janklow, a Republican, dominated South Dakota's political landscape. His political rise began in 1974 with his election as the state's attorney general. He served four energetic and controversial terms as governor before his election to Congress in 2002. 
He resigned after an August 2003 traffic accident north of Sioux Falls in which he ran a stop sign and struck and killed a motorcyclist. The next year, a jury convicted him of manslaughter, and he was jailed for 100 days.
As a public figure, Mr. Janklow was compellingly quotable and a creative maker of headlines. He was known to have worn a bunny suit in public - the result of a prank by his daughter - and to have toted a machine gun in an aborted 1976 plan to rescue hostages held at the state capitol. He once described himself as the "best fat-man water skier in South Dakota."
He once told a former state lawmaker in a heated exchange of letters: "My mom said I should never call a person a 'Jerk' in writing. Please send me your phone number." 
To People magazine in 1999, he said, "I'm the toughest, most hard-nosed, right-wing conservative you've ever met." 
Behind the bluster, Mr. Janklow was a major political force. In a 1980 profile, the New York Times called him "intelligent, intense and articulate . . . [with] the energy of a brigade of ordinary mortals." 
His feats included converting a state college campus into a prison with vocational training. He also used prison labor to build affordable housing for senior citizens. He persuaded the legislature to change interest rate laws, a move that lured the Citibank credit card operation to the state. He presided over the linking of school classrooms to the Internet. 
William John Janklow was born in Chicago on Sept. 13, 1939. He grew up in Flandreau, S.D., his mother's home town, after the death of his father. 
He dropped out of high school to join the Marine Corps. When he returned to South Dakota in 1960, he married Mary Dean Thom. She survives him, along with three children. 
He received a law degree from the University of South Dakota in 1966. His first job after law school was in the legal aid program of the Rosebud Indian Reservation in South Dakota. 
In seven years, he was said to have won acquittals of 30 American Indians accused of murder or manslaughter. Later, as a prosecutor for the state attorney general's office, he acquired a reputation as a staunch opponent of Indian claims. He prosecuted 22 people, most of them associated with American Indian Movement, who were charged with rioting and arson in an Indian rights protest in 1973.
He ran for attorney general in 1974 and won with 66.7 percent of the vote. It was during his term as his state's top law enforcement officer that the machine gun incident happened. 
Working at home in 1976 on the Bicentennial Fourth of July, Mr. Janklow heard that a gunman had entered the state capitol and taken hostages. Believing some of them to be his secretaries, he seized an automatic weapon left from his Marine Corps days and rushed to the scene. 
After being told that his secretaries were not among the hostages, he decided to let the police handle the situation. 
"No drama," he said later. "My machine gun days are over."
In 1978, Republican leaders urged him to run for governor. He won with 56 percent of the vote. In 1982, he was reelected, winning 71 percent of the vote. 
Barred by state law from serving more than two consecutive terms as governor, he ran in the Republican primary for U.S. Senate in 1986 but lost to incumbent Jim Abdnor. Eight years later, he won his third term as governor, and he was elected to a fourth term in 1998.
He cut property taxes, built a women's prison and had prisoners laying fiber optic lines. His detractors said he was a bully and domineering. His supporters said he got things done. 
Mr. Jankow also admitted that he had a reputation for driving too fast. On Jan. 23, 2004, in a Flandreau court room, a judge sentenced him to 100 days in jail for speeding through a stop sign and running over 55-year-old Randy Scott on a motorcycle.
"I understand," the former governor and congressman said. "I killed somebody. I can't be punished more than I'm punishing myself."
He was contrite in court. But after serving his sentence, he wanted his driver's license back, which had been suspended on his conviction. 
As governor, he told the state supreme court, "When I was racing to fires in the Black Hills, or storms in Herrick or floods in Watertown . . . I was a hero for getting there in a hurry."
 His license was reinstated.

3 teens wounded, 1 critically, in shooting near schools in Southeast

BYLINE: Paul Duggan

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B03

LENGTH: 255 words

Three young people were wounded, one critically, when gunfire broke out Thursday morning on a residential street near two schools in Southeast Washington, police said. 
The incident occurred about 9:30 a.m. near Sixth Street and Alabama Avenue in the Congress Heights neighborhood, close to Ballou Senior High School and King Elementary School. Police spokeswoman Gwendolyn Crump did not name the victims but said they were young men ages 16 to 19.
The three apparently were together in the 600 block of Alabama when they were shot, police said. They said one of the wounded teens collapsed at the scene and was taken to a hospital in critical condition.
The other two ran away but were found in the area by police. Their wounds were described as not life-threatening.
Police said Thursday afternoon that "two people have been detained for questioning" in the case but that no charges had been filed.
The motive for the shooting remained unclear. Police are investigating whether there was an exchange of gunfire.
"Unfortunate that it would happen in front of a school," Police Chief Cathy L. Lanier said, standing near the crime scene. "Especially an elementary school, which is kind of the enraging part of the whole thing, regardless of what was behind somebody deciding to pull out a gun and shoot another person."
Imagine Southeast Public Charter School in the 3100 block of Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue and King Elementary in the 3200 block of Sixth Street were placed on lockdown after the shooting. Ballou was not.

'Crimestopper' doesn't plan to come up short

DATELINE: BALTIMORE

BALTIMORE - How can this kid ever hope to make it?
You have to start with the obvious: Aquille Carr is 5 feet 7, maybe a buck-forty-five soaking wet. It's what you notice first about the junior point guard from Baltimore's Patterson High, even before the impossible vertical leap and the sick crossovers and the radiant smile and the incessant trash talk. He isn't small. He isn't smallish. He's tiny. 
He may have inherited his old man's hops - Alan Carr, Aquille's father, was a Baltimore hoops legend himself back in the day, a 6-2 shooting guard who could jump right out of the building - but he got his mama's height. Tammy Carr, bless her heart, is 4-11 on a good day.
Aquille, 18, has super-size dreams - the NBA, worldwide stardom, endorsements. And in that vulnerable space between boyhood and manhood, his life, both on and off the court, is accelerating at a dizzying rate.  
He unofficially committed to play for Seton Hall University last week; he doesn't plan on being there for long. But at each higher level, his height is going to be a bigger problem, when those trees in the paint - that he loves to go around, through or over - are no longer 6-3 or 6-4, but 6-9 and 7-1.
Do you know how many players 5-7 or shorter have had NBA careers that lasted 300 games or more? Three: Spud Webb, Muggsy Bogues and Earl Boykins. Do you know how many made an all-star team even once? None.
"That's what I always hear - 'He can't do this. He can't do that. He's too small,' " Carr says. "But I've been proving people wrong a long time now. And I'm just getting started."

Carr comes to town
How can this kid possibly fail? 
Have you seen Aquille Carr play? If not, you get your chance Monday night when Carr's Patterson Clippers, the No. 1 team in the Baltimore Sun's rankings,  take on The Washington Post's No. 3 team, Gonzaga, at Coolidge High. The game is part of Patterson's national schedule (funded largely by Under Armour, which has a two-year deal to outfit the team) that has already taken the Clippers to Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and New Jersey this season.
Trust us, you have never seen anything like it - a 5-7 slasher who has put up nearly 30 points per game the past two seasons, who dunks routinely, whose crossover move draws comparisons to Allen Iverson's, whose vertical leap has been measured at 48 inches, who is rated the 26th-best prospect in his class by Rivals.com, who was on the cover of Dime Magazine in August with a story that called him "without question, the country's most electrifying high school player."
"He's a defensive nightmare," says one assistant at a Big East school that recruited him who asked not to be named because college coaches are not allowed to discuss potential recruits until after they have officially signed with a school.
"With his type of speed and quickness," says an ACC assistant, "there's not a lot of guys, even at the highest level, who can do what he does."
And he doesn't just beat you. He humiliates you. He talks about yo mama. ("Best trash-talker in the city," says Dominic Barnes of rival Digital Harbor High, after Carr lit up the Rams for 32 points earlier this season.) He breaks your ankles on the perimeter with a crossover dribble, then laughs as he sails through the trees inside, and on his way back down the floor he gets in your face, tells you you're gutless and dares you to try to guard him again.
Here is what poor John Cooper, coach of Urbana High, had to say after Carr destroyed his team with 43 points in last year's Maryland 4A North region final: "We tried to prepare for what we'd face tonight [from Carr], but I mean, what can you do? . . .  I probably talked to about 20 coaches about how to defend him, and they all said he's just a freak of a player [who] can make you look ridiculous."
Have you seen him? Some 2.9 million (and counting) of you have watched his Hoopmixtape.com highlight reelon YouTube. Maybe you're one of those who were moved to add comments: "I watch this every day for inspiration." "one word: WOW!!" "dude SICK. NO DOUBT."
Carr's legend is big enough that NBA players are lining up to get a piece. The Washington Wizards' John Wall came to see him play last season and asked Carr to work out with his little brother. Carr says he has cellphone numbers for both Wall and Brandon Jennings of the Milwaukee Bucks. 
Naturally, Carr draws comparisons to both Bogues and Shawnta Rogers, another diminutive Baltimore point guard who had a stellar career at George Washington University and overseas as a pro.
"Remember," says longtime Baltimore hoops fixture Bob Wade, who coached Bogues at Dunbar High, "they said Muggsy could never make it. But he changed the game."As a freshman at Patterson, Carr went for a triple-double in his debut. He put up 39 points and 19 assists on  Josh Selby , now a Memphis Grizzles rookie, when Patterson played Selby's Lake Clifton High. As a sophomore, he scored 57 against Forest Park (Md.), breaking his school's 50-year old single-game record. He dunked on 6-5 forward  Nick Faust , now a freshman at the  University of Maryland  , in what the Baltimore Sun dubbed "the dunk heard 'round Baltimore."
Last April, playing for Team USA in an international under-19 tournament in Italy, Carr put up 45 points and was carried off the court by the Italian fans. Within days he had a contract offer from an Italian professional team reported to be for $750,000.
"Nah," Aquille laughs when asked if Italy is still a possibility. "I'm not going over there."
In Baltimore, where there hasn't been a pro team since the Bullets left for Washington in 1973, and where there are no big-time collegiate programs, high school hoops is a religion - an urban, indoor "Friday Night Lights" - and Carr is its spiritual leader.
On the court, his best moves turn spectators into revival-tent congregants, rising to their feet, waving their arms, dancing in the aisles, testifying - moved by the spirit of something that feels close to holy.
"God," Tammy Carr says, "gave this child a gift."

A hard neighborhood 
How can this kid ever hope to make it?
This is east Baltimore. And it's hard out here. You know all the social ills: Crime. Drugs. Broken homes. Bad schools. It's no wonder Carr calls himself a homebody. There's nothing good going on outside.
"I don't really pay it no mind," he says. "I just do what I have to do in school and practice, [and] chill with my family." 
     Although "The Wire," HBO's dearly departed, groundbreaking, so-real-it's-scary urban-crime drama, was set mostly in Baltimore's west side, it was mostly filmed on the east side - because the dearth of trees allowed for year-round filming and because the many blocks filled with abandoned, boarded-up homes made for quieter sets.
"The biggest motivation these kids have," says Harry Martin, Patterson's head coach, "is to walk out their front doors and take a look around."
To get to Patterson's gym, you drive past the industrial yards filled with empty semi-truck containers. You park in the school lot just off Kane Street. Get there early - by halftime of the preceding JV game, or you'll be parking on the street, and there's a good chance you won't get in - since the gym only seats about 300 and they often turn away hundreds more.
You walk through the magnetometer and past the Baltimore City Public Schools Police officer at the entrance (and note the half-dozen or so additional officers lining the gym). 
This is a job for the Crimestopper.
Aquille Carr acquired that brilliant nickname because, as legend has it, all the dealers, hustlers and assorted knuckleheads in east Baltimore shut down business for those two hours every time Patterson has a game.
"Ain't no flashing lights," Tammy Carr says, "until after the game."
"Ain't no way you're going to try to go kill somebody or rob somebody when Patterson's playing," Aquille says. "Naw. They're coming to see the show first."
Rodney Coffield, an 18-year veteran of the Baltimore Police Department, who until this year doubled as the head coach at the city's Douglass High, provides confirmation that the legend of the Crimestopper is rooted in truth.
"All your gangbangers, your drug dealers, people out robbing in the community, all the so-called big G's - those guys are going to be in there, just to make sure they see this kid play," Coffield says. "And believe me, there's money [being gambled] on it - how many points [Carr] scores, stuff like that."
Indeed, the handy crime map on the BPD's Web site shows that in the week preceding Dec. 19 - the night Patterson hosted rival City College High (and the most recent Patterson home game for which data was available) - there were three car break-ins and two aggravated assaults within a half-mile radius (the largest available search radius) of the school.
But on Dec. 19 itself, with the Crimestopper doing his thing, and the tiny gym packed with both the devout and the sinister, there was not a single crime reported in the area. 

The love of family
How can this kid possibly fail? 
"You can't get love like we got right here," Alan Carr, 49, says. Alan and Tammy have just been wrapped up from behind in a stealth-attack bear hug by Aquille, as the family sits at the dining room table at their daughter Ashlie's rowhouse, in a working-class eastside neighborhood - the gathering spot for friends and family members after Aquille's games. 
"You can't pay for this," Alan says, placing a hand on the arm of Aquille, the youngest of the family's three children. "I told him when he was 14, I said, 'Aquille, when you start getting big-headed, all those people you despise - you're going to become one of them. You need to stay grounded. We're going to be with you 100 percent, regardless of what decisions you make.' "
According to CountyHealthRankings.org, 62 percent of children in Baltimore live in single-parent households, nearly double the statewide rate. Martin counts only four players, Aquille included, among the 12 on Patterson's roster who live in two-parent households. 
"It's rare," Aquille says. "Most everyone I hang with, they just got a mom, or they just got a dad. And I know that's tough for them. I just thank God I got both my parents." 
Alan Carr's own parents were together for 40 years, and just before his father passed away, he said to Alan, "Whatever you do, take care of your kids." 
At 19, Alan - known as "Alan Star" around Baltimore during his schoolboy days at Patterson - had the makings of a pretty good college career, having put together a solid freshman season at Essex (Md.) Community College, which he chose to work on his grades in hopes of moving on to a bigger program. 
But when Tammy got pregnant, Alan, mindful of his father's dying wishes, dropped out of school to support his family, going to work driving a truck and delivering appliances for Baltimore Gas and Electric.
Alan Carr has instilled in both of his sons - Alan Jr., himself a star athlete in his day, is 12 years older than Aquille - an understanding of what it means to be a man, and to be a father. Alan Jr. is father to a 4-year-old boy, Amare.
And Aquille's time is coming fast.
Come April, when Patterson's season is long finished and the days are getting longer and warmer and the teenage mind starts to turn to summer vacation, there's going to be a blessing visited upon the Carr family. 
There's going to be a baby, a little Crimestopper. Aquille is going to be a father. And you don't even need to ask what that means for Aquille. 
"The Carrs take care of their kids," Alan says. "This isn't going to affect things at all. Me and Tammy are going to be involved. Aquille's going to have a lot of help." 
But of course, a baby does affect things. It affects everything. And it makes you wonder. 
How can this kid ever hope to make it? 
How can this kid possibly fail?

Going Out Guide's family movie reviews

BYLINE: Jane Horwitz

SECTION: WEEKEND; Pg. T35

LENGTH: 895 words

G
BEAUTY AND THE BEAST 3D. Disney has digitally remastered its lovely 1991 animated musical classic in 3-D, and it remains a delight. But parents of kids younger than 8 should note that the wolves that surround Belle's father in the forest, and that later threaten her, are even more frightening in 3-D. In 1991, this was a groundbreaking film because it mixed hand-drawn animation with backgrounds created using computers. The result is still stunning, and the songs still great. 
THE BOTTOM LINE: Aside from the more intense 3-D scenes with the wolves, other elements that catch one's attention two-plus decades later: The girls in Belle's village are a tad more buxom than they'd probably be today. The big fight shows Gaston falling to his (presumable) death. The Beast is wounded.  

PG
We Bought a Zoo.ג[#x20ac][#x201a]Certainly the most family-friendly and mildest movie of the season, "We Bought a Zoo" offers kids 10 and older and their parents a heartwarming story, good acting and cool critters. The movie follows single dad Benjamin, a journalist grieving over his late wife. He decides to quit his job and move the family to a house in the country - even after he learns that a financially struggling private zoo comes with it. His sad adolescent son, Dylan, hates the idea, but daughter Rosie loves it. 
The bottom line: The script includes rare barnyard profanity and mild sexual innuendo. A sick animal is put down. This happens off-screen. Dylan draws disturbing images that reflect his grief and alienation. Adult characters drink. 

PG-

13
THE IRON LADY. It's unlikely teens or even most college students, except perhaps history and poli-sci majors, will have much interest in this unusual, rather apolitical study of Britain's first female prime minister, Margaret Thatcher. Many will squirm through its stately pace. Teens interested in the finer points of acting, however, can delight in Meryl Streep's infinitely detailed embodiment of the grande dame. Told from the point of view of a widowed and ever more distracted Thatcher, the film will disappoint those who wanted more of a critique of her policies. Instead they get her history in fragmented flashbacks.  
The bottom line:  The film includes frightening reenactments of Irish Republican Army bombings, as well as raucous, occasionally violent anti-Thatcher demonstrations and strikes. There are archival shots of war violence and brief toplessness. A central theme is Thatcher's slow descent into dementia. Some characters drink and smoke. 
JOYFUL NOISE. Kids 12 and older who like comedies about grown-ups acting silly and stories laced with a touch of spiritual revival might have a little fun with "Joyful Noise." Still, they'll have to forgive the movie's excessive two-hour length and disjointed mess of a story. Vi Rose Hill is named director of the church choir in a financially struggling Georgia hamlet, which miffs G.G., a wealthy choir member. G.G.'s wayward grandson comes to stay and immediately starts courting Vi's daughter. There's too much poorly directed plot, but the singing and corny humor make up for it - kinda. 
The bottom line:  The script includes a couple of barnyard epithets and mild sexual slang. Two secondary characters, both single, have sex out of wedlock.

R
CONTRABAND. Reformed smuggler Chris Farraday reluctantly takes up his old line of work when his brother-in-law gets in dutch with a vindictive drug dealer. Taut, dark and propulsive, the film is laced throughout with coarse language and contains a violent shootout during a smuggling run to Panama. Although the film attempts to excuse Chris's illegal activities as necessary, the mounting death toll makes him a less than entirely admirable antihero. 
The bottom line:  Mayhem in the form of vehicular assault, hand-to-hand combat and extended gunplay make for a more than moderately bloody crime caper. Pervasive strong language, drug use and a woman and children in jeopardy ensure that the film is only for older teens. 
IN THE LAND OF BLOOD AND HONEY. College-age cinema buffs will be moved and impressed by this saga of the Bosnian civil war in the 1990s. There is never any sense that the film is a vanity project for writer-director Angelina Jolie. She has made a highly effective film, with a love story involving Bosnian artist Ajla and Serbian policeman Danijel. Motives grow blurred as the violence worsens. 
The bottom line:  Strictly for audiences older than 17, "In the Land of Blood and Honey" depicts rape, shootings of noncombatants and Nazi-style roundups for "ethnic cleansing." Other mayhem includes bombings, point-blank shootings and the implied death of an infant. Consensual sexual situations, as well as the rapes, are explicitly portrayed.  
CARNAGE. Only the most forgiving, theater-loving high-schoolers will be able to make it through this annoying film adaptation of Yasmina Reza's hit stage play, the dark comedy of manners "God of Carnage." Director Roman Polanski and his top-notch cast can't make the dialogue-heavy script, set almost entirely in a living room, work on film. What starts out as a civilized, let's-all-just-get-along meeting degenerates into a nasty contest of more primitive instincts.
The bottom line:  The film includes strong profanity, gross toilet humor and drinking.

Panetta decries Afghan video

BYLINE: Craig Whitlock;Greg Jaffe

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A01

LENGTH: 1043 words

The Obama administration on Thursday strongly condemned a viral video that apparently depicts Marines desecrating corpses as U.S. officials tried to prevent a popular backlash in Afghanistan and forestall damage to nascent peace talkswith the Taliban.
As the images of Marines urinating on three bloodied bodies circulated around the globe, Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta denounced the video as "utterly deplorable" and called Afghan President Hamid Karzai to assure him that the incident would be thoroughly investigated.
"I wanted him to know how grieved we were at what happened here," Panetta said in an interview while traveling to Fort Bliss, Tex. "What I want is an investigation into what happened here, what laws were violated by what took place, who these individuals were." 
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton expressed "total dismay" at the apparent behavior by Marines. Army Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that he was "deeply disturbed" and that the actions "erode the reputation of our joint force."
The swift U.S. response was intended to stave off the kind of international outrage that followed the 2004 release of pictures depicting the humiliating treatment of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison. Military officials said they feared the photographic evidence of apparent Marine misconduct could produce a severe setback at a critical time in Afghanistan.
U.S. officials have stepped up their long-shot efforts to negotiate a political settlement with the Taliban while struggling to maintain support from Karzai. The United States is also confronting an increasingly war-weary population in Afghanistan, where people often lend a sympathetic ear to Taliban propaganda about the presence and motives of foreign troops.
Before receiving Panetta's call Thursday, Karzai reacted sharply to news of the video, describing it as "completely inhumane and condemnable in the strongest possible terms." His administration called on the U.S. military to "apply the most severe punishment to anyone found guilty in this crime."
Panetta said the phone call seemed to mollify the Afghan leader. "He appreciated what I was saying and appreciated the fact we understand how damaging this could be and that we are taking that kind of action."

Video implicates Marines
The video, which runs for less than a minute, appears to show four Marines in combat gear laughing and joking as they urinate on three male bodies lined up on the ground next to a toppled wheelbarrow. The caption refers to the corpses as "dead Talibans," but it was unclear whether they were civilians or fighters killed after a battle.
A caption that accompanies the video asserts that the Marines are part of a scout sniper team with the 3rd Battalion, 2nd Marines, an infantry unit from Camp Lejeune, N.C. Marines from the unit were deployed to Afghanistan last year but returned to the United States in September.
The NATO-led security force in Kabul said in a statement that the acts of desecration "appear to have been conducted by a small group of U.S. individuals, who apparently are no longer serving in Afghanistan." The statement did not elaborate.
A Marine official said investigators were questioning two individuals whom they had preliminarily identified as being in the video. The Marine Corps is "fairly confident" that all four were members of the 3rd Battalion, 2nd Marines, the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is underway.
It was unclear where or when the video was made. It was posted on the Internet on Wednesday and began to circulate quickly as news sites reported on its existence.
Pentagon officials said that they were still trying to confirm the video's authenticity but that they had no reason to believe it was a fake. "It certainly appears to us to be what it appears to be to you guys," Capt. John Kirby, a Defense Department spokesman, told reporters.
Gen. James F. Amos, the commandant of the Marine Corps, said he asked the Naval Criminal Investigative Service to "pull together a team of their very best agents and immediately assign them responsibility to thoroughly investigate every aspect of the filmed event."
He also said he would assign a Marine general and a senior lawyer to conduct a parallel inquiry. Marine officials said that probe would be led by Lt. Gen. Thomas D. Waldhauser, head of the Marine Corps Forces Central Command.
"Rest assured that the institution of the Marine Corps will not rest until the allegations and the events surrounding them have been resolved," Amos said.
U.S. military law and the Geneva Conventions prohibit the desecration, mishandling or exploitation of bodies of people killed in war.

Digital dilemma of war
Battlefield videos and photography have become a common hobby among deployed troops. Many amateur productions wind up on the Internet. On occasion, the trend has caused severe embarrassment for the U.S. military, or, in rare cases, such as the Abu Ghraib scandal in Iraq, triggered international controversy and legal action.
Some military analysts praised the Pentagon for its prompt condemnation of the Marines' apparent behavior but said that such incidents are hardly new in the history of warfare.
"We shouldn't be shocked that this kind of thing happens in a war," said Andrew M. Exum, a retired Army captain who served in Afghanistan and is a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security in Washington. "The difference today is now we have smartphones."
The Taliban, which has a long-standing reputation for brutality and beheadings, sought to exploit the Marines' actions. "It was inhuman and despicable, an unforgivable act," said Taliban spokesman Qari Yousuf Ahmadi.
At the same time, the Taliban did not indicate that it would use the video as an immediate excuse to walk away from the negotiating table. In a statement Thursday, the group said it would continue to pursue a political solution to the decade-long conflict in Afghanistan.

Home invasion inPr. George's County
A woman was sexually assaulted by a man who forced his way into her Temple Hills house Friday morning, and investigators are exploring whether it might be connected to two similar home invasion incidents in Montgomery County, Prince George's County authorities said. 
The incident occurred about 6:30 a.m. Friday in the 2500 block of Berkley Street, they said. Cpl. Mike Rodriguez, a Prince George's County police spokesman, said the woman first spotted the man when she went outside to warm up her car and, suspicious of him, promptly went back inside. The man had a handgun and forced his way into the house, Rodriguez said.
Rodriguez said the man bound several other people inside, then took the woman to a separate room, where he sexually assaulted her. He left in the woman's car, a 2008 white, four-door Honda Civic with the Maryland license plate 6AE9788, Rodriguez said.

Man fatally shotin Landover area
A man was fatally shot Thursday in the Landover area, and Prince George's County  police are seeking an acquaintance of his, authorities said.
Brian Keith Tann, 43, of Landover was shot just before 10:30 p.m. Thursday in the 7700 block of Bender Road, said Cpl. Larry Johnson, a police spokesman. Johnson said police had obtained a warrant charging the acquaintance with first-degree murder. He declined to release the acquaintance's name because officers had yet to serve that warrant.

Body found in Capitol Heights
A man's body was found behind a dumpster at a Capitol Heights area apartment complex Friday, and police are exploring the case as a homicide, authorities said.
A maintenance worker at the Woodhaven Apartments in the 1400 block of Doewood Lane discovered the body while he was taking trash to the dumpster about 8:30 a.m. Friday, said Cpl. Henry Tippett, a Prince George's County police spokesman. He said the body was wrapped in plastic and had obvious trauma, though investigators were not sure of the exact nature of the wounds.
Detectives have not yet identified the man.

Fairfax death sentence upheld
The Virginia Supreme Court ruled Friday that Alfredo R. Prieto, convicted of killing a man and woman outside Reston in 1988, should be executed, affirming a Fairfax County jury and judge whoimposed two death sentences in 2010.
Prieto, 45, was convicted of fatally shooting Warren Fulton III, 22, and then fatally shooting and raping Rachael Raver, 22, in a vacant lot near Hunter Mill Road in December 1988. Prieto also faces a death sentence in California for a 1990 rape and murder.

3 sentenced to prison for plotting terror attacks 
Three members of what prosecutors called a homegrown terror ring who conspired to attack the U.S. Marine Corps base in Quantico, Va., and other targets were sentenced Friday to between 15 and 45 years in prison.
Hysen Sherifi, 27, will serve 45 years; Ziyad Yaghi, 23, nearly 32 years. Mohammad Omar Aly Hassan, 24, will serve 15 years. Each said he would appeal his conviction. 
Defense attorneys argued for lesser sentences because the men were convicted of discussing terrorism rather than committing terrorism acts. 
U.S. District Judge Louise Flanagan, in New Bern, disagreed, saying the men went beyond talk to planning violence.
They are among eight men who federal investigators say raised money, stockpiled weapons and trained for jihadistattacks.

Tanker reaches Nome,  now must get oil to shore
A Russian tanker has muscled through hundreds of miles of Bering Sea ice to deliver fuel to Nome. Now comes the tricky part: getting more than a million gallons of diesel and gasoline to shore through a mile-long hose without a spill.
Nome's harbor is iced-in, keeping the 370-foot tanker from docking. It will have to moor offshore to transfer the fuel. 
A Coast Guard icebreaker escorted the tanker through the Bering Sea, the two vessels at times barely crawling along as officials looked for techniques to get the tanker free of shifting ice.
A storm prevented Nome from getting fuel by barge in November. Without the tanker delivery, supplies of diesel fuel, gas and home heating fuel are expected to run out in March and April, well before the next barge delivery.

Samantha Garvey's family was offered a rent-subsidized home by officials in the Long Island county where Garvey goes to school.
Garvey is one of 300 semifinalists nationally.  Finalists will be announced this month. The top prize is $100,000.
Garvey and her family moved into a homeless shelter on Jan. 1.
The 17-year-old's Intel project focused on predators' effects on ribbed mussels.

String of killings in New Orleans:  An outbreak of violence has shocked New Orleans, with 17 people shot in an 18-hour period. In all, a dozen people have been slain in the first 12 days of the year and twice that number wounded. The latest outbreak follows a 14 percent jump in homicides in 2011, with 199 during the year. Per capita, the murder rate in New Orleans was 10 times the national average in 2010, with 51 homicides per 100,000 residents there last year.
Worker kills three at lumber company:A disgruntled employee opened fire at a lumber company in central North Carolina early Friday, killing three people and injuring another person before he went home and shot himself, leaving him wounded, authorities said. Authorities said witnesses reported that the gunman, who was not identified, worked at McBride Lumber. It wasn't clear what he was upset about. 
Snow finally hits Midwest, Northeast: Many Americans' first real taste of winter this season blew through the Midwest and Northeast on Friday, leaving ski resort operators giddy and delaying commuters and air passengers. Atmospheric patterns, including the Pacific phenomenon known as La Nina, have made this an unusually icy winter in Alaska and an unusually warm one in parts of the lower 48 states. The storm caused hundreds of traffic accidents and at least three road deaths in Iowa and Missouri.

New San Francisco sheriff is charged with domestic violence

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

SAN FRANCISCO - Prosecutors on Friday charged San Francisco's newly sworn-in sheriff with three misdemeanors, including domestic violence, related to a New Year's Eve incident with his wife. 
Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi faces one count each of domestic violence battery, child endangerment and dissuading a witness, San Francisco District Attorney George Gascon said.
"Whether this was the elected sheriff or any other San Francisco resident, this type of behavior is inexcusable, criminal and will be prosecuted," Gascon said.
He said an arrest warrant has been issued, and prosecutors have requested an emergency protective order prohibiting Mirkarimi from having contact with his wife and son. He is also ordered to stay away from his home while police investigate other possible domestic violence incidents involving the couple, Gascon said.
Mirkarimi could be arraigned as early as Tuesday, Gascon said.
The sheriff, 50, vowed to remain in office while he fights the allegations. "The charges are very unfounded," he said calmly to reporters.
He said he planned to turn himself in for fingerprinting and mug shots. "We are cooperating," he said.
His wife spoke much more emotionally. "This is unbelievable," she said. "I don't have any complaint against my husband."
A neighbor reported that Mirkarimi grabbed and bruised Eliana Lopez's arm during a heated argument at their home, according to a police affidavit.
The injury reportedly was captured on a video recorded by the neighbor, and described in a text-message conversation between Lopez and the neighbor, according to the affidavit.
Lopez, a former Venezuelan telenovela star, said in a statement that the episode was "completely taken out of context."
The couple was married after having their first child in 2009. Days after the alleged dispute, Mirkarimi was sworn in as San Francisco sheriff.
San Francisco's sheriff does not have broad law enforcement powers. The position mostly entails overseeing an organization of more than 800 sworn officers and a civilian staff of about 100.
Mirkarimi was elected sheriff in November after serving seven years as one of the city's more liberal supervisors.
If convicted, Mirkarimi would have to give up his department-issued firearm. He also could be sent to jail for up to a year.
Under state law, he could be automatically removed from office only if convicted of a felony.

A misreading of gun laws

SECTION: EDITORIAL COPY; Pg. A15

LENGTH: 110 words

Washington state's gun laws are not "among the most lax" in the country ["Tragedy at Mount Rainier," editorial, Jan. 3]. According to the anti-gun rights Brady Campaign's 2010 state rankings, 37 states have less restrictive gun laws than Washington's. 
The Post further demonstrates that it is out of touch by lamenting Washington's failure to require training, permits and registration to purchase firearms, as well as its practice of issuing concealed-handgun permits to adults "without a serious criminal record or history of mental illness." The vast majority of states have these policies.

The adventure

BYLINE: Cathy Areu

SECTION: MAGAZINE; Pg. A05

LENGTH: 455 words

When I was in grade school, the first book I took out of the Philadelphia public library, when I got my library card as a first-grader, was a biography of Alexander the Great. I was so interested in heroes and national leaders. All my life, as a kid, I would get a Landmark book - a biography of Lincoln or Jefferson or Washington or Davy Crockett. And I was always [reading] nonfiction when my brother was getting Hardy Boys.  
I wanted to do something adventurous and somewhat risky in youth. I think rite of passage is a very important part of growing up. Certainly, all of the heroes did it. I was a http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/post/obama-signs-bill-giving-peace-corps-volunteers-more-protections/2011/03/23/gIQAxvJmiN_blog.html" title="www.washingtonpost.comvolunteer. I certainly was driven to the Peace Corps in Africa with a sense of adventure - going out there alone, out there in the bush, by myself, on a motorcycle. I was in Swaziland. And you're out there on your own. It was pretty brazen, I'd say. 
After I came back from Africa, from the Peace Corps, I came to Washington, and I never really went home to Philadelphia. That was really a critical decision. I love Washington - I really do love the city. 
I came to Capitol Hill to look for a job as a legislative assistant, and I couldn't get a legislative assistant job right away. But I did get a job with a senator from Utah - Frank Moss, a Democrat. He gave me a job working in the office during the day but getting paid by being a police officer at night. It was patronage. And I did that for three months and was a full-time legislative person after that. I was really moonlighting at that job. I had the uniform - the gun and everything - but I was basically working in the office during the day, writing short speeches and answering complicated legislative mail. It worked. It was one way to get in the door. And then Frank Moss helped me get a job with [Ed] Muskie and the Senate Budget Committee. From there, I got a job at the White House, became a speechwriter for President Carter. One thing led to the other. 
I'm interested in political leadership and courage and standing up for something. It's very hard to explain. I was paying attention to the '52 election, believe it or not, when I was, like, 6. I paid very much attention to the '60 election. 
My grandfather was a local Democratic political figure in Philadelphia - Charlie Shields, a very classic sort of Irishman. And I would talk politics with him all the time. I loved him, and I loved going for walks with him in downtown Philadelphia, the Irish neighborhoods. He may [have been] grumpy to other people, but, to me, he always lit up. And I always lit up when I was with him.

Dead man found on road, friend with self-inflicted wound

BYLINE: Martin Weil

SECTION: METRO; Pg. C06

LENGTH: 195 words

An 18-year-old man was found dead on a Maryland road early Saturday with injuries that appeared consistent with a crash, authorities said. The Frederick County Sheriff's Office said vehicle debris and skid marks were nearby, but no vehicle. 
At the home of a friend of the victim's, deputies found a man, also 18, with what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound, the sheriff's office said.
The sheriff's office identified the dead man as Brandon E. Herbert and the wounded man as Seth B. Fisher, both of Thurmont, northwest of Washington.
After Herbert was found on Black Road about 2 a.m., investigators learned that he might have been with a friend earlier, the sheriff's office said.
A truck at the friend's house showed damage consistent with the roadway debris, and the wounded man was spotted in the house and taken to a hospital, the sheriff's office said. Officials said they were still trying to determine how or why the crash occurred.

Metro hires two for public-relations team
Lynn Bowersox, Metro's managing director of public relations, said the transit authority has hired two Washington journalists for its media team:
l Caroline Lukas, a "producer in the Washington bureau of Canadian Broadcasting," will be the media relations manager reporting to Metro's chief spokesman and director of communications, Dan Stessel, Bowersox said. 
lPhilip Stewart, a reporter for News Channel 8 and WJLA, will be a public information officer.
Salaries could not be learned.
Stessel said the hires were necessary because Metro's communications functions have grown.
"We're doing more than media relations," Stessel said. "The whole social-media function is new. We've started a two-way conversation on Twitter, Facebook, and we're doing videos."

Fake police officers rob motorist in Southeast

BYLINE: Katherine Driessen

SECTION: METRO; Pg. C06

LENGTH: 217 words

Two men impersonating police officers robbed a motorist in Southeast Washington early Saturday, police said.
Driving in a dark, 2004 or 2005 Chevrolet Impala, the men turned on a set of dashboard lights and pulled over the victim in the 4800 block of Texas Avenue SE about 3 a.m., police said. The men were wearing dark-colored vests with the word "police" written across the front and were carrying holstered guns, authorities said. 
The men instructed the victim to get out of his car and then robbed him of about $4o0  before fleeing in the Impala, police said. The victim was not harmed.
D.C. police Capt. Brian Harris cautioned residents about the incident during a Saturday news conference, saying anyone pulled over can ask the officer to show identification. Or, if someone is suspicious about being stopped, Harris recommended calling 911.
He said there were no reports of similar crimes in the area.
The robbers did not present any badges or other police identification during the robbery, police said.
Harris asked anyone with information about the incident to contact police.

Suspect in robberies and assaults is arrested

LENGTH: 467 words

A suspect in home invasion robberieslast week in Bethesda, Wheaton and Temple Hills was arrested Saturday in North Carolina, authorities said.
Montgomery County police said Kevin Ray, 33, of Fort Washington was identified in the Bethesda and Wheaton incidents after authorities released a photo of the suspect using a stolen credit card. Numerous tips from the public helped detectives identify Ray and track him to Currituck County, N.C., authorities said. 
The first home invasion took place Jan. 10 in Wheaton, when a robber approached a woman in the garage of her home around 10 a.m. and demanded money from her wallet, which the victim gave to him, according to police. The man demanded the woman's debit card, personal identification number and car keys, according to authorities, and later used the stolen card. The victim was not injured, police said.
The second robbery occurred the next day in Bethesda when a man forced his way into a home on Bardon Road, police said. A housekeeper who arrived for work shortly before 7 a.m. encountered a man at the door when she went to move her car, authorities said.
The housekeeper was forced into the house at gunpoint, according to police, where she was tied up and sexually assaulted. The man also tied up the homeowner and the homeowner's teenage son before stealing a debit card and the keys to the housekeeper's vehicle, which he used to flee the scene, police said.
Prince George's County police said Saturday night that they had obtained a warrant charging Ray in a Friday morning home invasion in Temple Hills. A woman was sexually assaulted by a man who forcibly entered her home with a handgun, a police spokesman said Saturday.
He described the Prince George's incident as "very similar" to at least one of t he Montgomery County incidents. However it was not immediately clear what led the Prince George's authorities to obtain the warrant.
Capt. Paul Starks, spokesman for the Montgomery County Police, said Saturday that authorities think they arrested the "primary" person responsible for the crimes in Wheaton and Bethesda.
Starks said "someone may have helped him during the crime, or afterwards. That's always something that's possible, but we do believe we have the man involved in the two home invasions in Montgomery County."
Ray remains in custody in Dare County, N.C., pending an extradition hearing, police said. He faces robbery, sexual assault and weapons charges in connection with the home invasion robberies in Montgomery County, authorities said.

From mighty weapons of war, art emerges

BYLINE: Christian Davenport

SECTION: SUNDAY ARTS; Pg. E03

LENGTH: 899 words

James Butcher was a 20-year-old lance corporal who had been in Vietnam only a couple of months, but that was long enough to realize that the scene in front of him - a Marine, sitting alone, waiting for his flight at the Phu Bai Air terminal in 1967 - was a powerful image of solitude and quiet that war so rarely affords.
So Butcher, a combat artist, took out his sketchbook and started drawing, hoping to get the details right. Doing nothing, he knew, is an important part of combat. "It's when you can contemplate where you are, what you're doing," he said. "It's when you learn a lot about fear." 
Eventually his scribbling became a painting, titled "Waiting," and it is part of an exhibit, "Fly Marines! The Centennial of Marine Corps Aviation: 1912-2012," which opened Saturday at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum.
Much of the collection is dedicated to showcasing the awesome, amped-up might of the Marines' air power. In frame after frame, there are hoo-rah scenes of Marines doing battle from the air in "Top Gun" fashion, from the open-cockpits of World War I to the fearsome Cobra helicopters used in the current conflicts.
A pair of fighter jets are painted as rhapsodically as Degas ballet dancers, a blur of motion and grace as they lift off in sync. Other images speak to purpose, mission and a super-charged patriotism; it's no wonder that the painting of the jet flying into the dark smoke while framed by an American flag was used as a part of a recruiting campaign.
In the exhibit, like in the movies and recruiting advertisements, jets are sexy and powerful and cool, and in the collection they strike many poses. There they are on aircraft carriers, over the minarets of Baghdad, the fields of France. There are helicopters under fire in Vietnam and delivering supplies to a Kurdish refugee camp. There's the majestic Marine One, lifting off from the White House lawn, with Ronald Reagan in tow.
Then there are images of jets unleashing ordnance by the ton, works that conjure Hiroshima and shock and awe, and affirm, in fire and ash, that the aircraft has long been the most mighty weapon of war.
"If you came here today looking for pretty airplane pictures, you are going to be hard pressed to find but a couple of those," said Lin Ezell, director of the National Museum of the Marine Corps, which oversees the Corps' art collection. "The show is a celebration not about the form of the aircraft itself but the function of aircraft in war, and that always has to do with people."
It is in the works in which the aircraft is relegated to the background that the collection rises above a mere showcasing of raw military firepower and begins to capture the war ethos and the Corps' uncommon, and almost tribal, band-of-brother ethos.
The purpose of air power, after all, is largely to help the units on the ground. And that story is told best when the Marine is the main character and the aircraft plays a supporting role.
In one of the most powerful works, "Close Air Support," the focus is on Marines advancing through enemy lines in North Korea. In the foreground is a dead Marine, his blood staining the snow and the blown-up tree stump next to him. But there in the distance is salvation: a Vought F4U Corsair, dropping a bomb on the bad guys.
The exhibit also touches on the important role Marine aircraft have played in escorting the wounded and fallen and the dangers pilots face, even while high above the battlefield.
One painting, titled "Ascent," shows an honor guard carrying a flag-draped casket of a fallen Marine into the belly of a C-17 headed home from Afghanistan in 2002. Another is a still life of a pilot's chair pocked with bullet holes, presumably the detritus of a deadly fire fight during the Vietnam War. In contrast to the ceremonial symbol known as the "fallen soldier battle cross" - two empty boots, a rifle with a helmet perched atop it - the work depicts a helmet dangling unceremoniously from the chair by its strap. And the scorched chair sits as lonely as a tombstone.
When he served as a combat artist in Iraq, Staff Sgt. Kristopher Battles, whose work from Iraq was part of the exhibit, was always on the lookout for scenes that told intimate stories of the wars and the people fighting them. But in the Corps they say, "every Marine's a rifleman," and so his foremost focus was "on the mission." That meant he carried a 9 mm pistol and an M-16 rifle in addition to his paints and sketchbooks.
"You need to know when to be an artist and when to be in combat mode," he said during a tour of the exhibit.
Forty-five years after he landed in Vietnam, Butcher still remembers the young Marine he painted waiting for his plane. "He was thinking about his girlfriend," he said.
It's not his best work, he admits. The plane isn't to scale. He was young then, an amateur who had limited training and was still struggling to find his style. And compared to many of the other pieces in the collection, it is decided muted. The Marine waiting for his plane has his helmet off, his gear and rifle stashed at his feet.
And it isn't clear whether the plane he is about to board is going to take him into combat or is finally headed home.

Rio de Janeiro: Brazil's tourist magnet now has less to fear

BYLINE: John Briley

SECTION: TRAVEL; Pg. F01

LENGTH: 2304 words

By most accounts, I should be very afraid. I'm walking - alone - down a steep, winding passageway in one of Rio de Janeiro's notorious slums, the Vidigal favela. If I extended my arms, winglike, I would touch, on both sides, homes made of mismatched cement, plywood, tin and tile. In the rare gaps between structures, tattered clothes hang on lines, drying in the 80-degree sun.
I'm being watched, but I have no idea by whom or from where. I'm not entirely sure that I'm going the right way, although I do know that the exit - where slum abruptly ends and upper-class Rio begins - is somewhere downhill from here. 
But I'm not worried about my security or the pack on my back, which contains, among other items, a $1,200 camera. And my relative insouciance in this place could signal a major shift for tourists in Rio. 
 Even if you haven't seen the fictitious "City of God," the more sensational "Elite Squad" or the documentary "Bus 174," you probably know about Rio's long-standing rep as dicey: beautifully situated and a heck of a party, but, say the warnings, if you dress flashily and stray from well-trod tourist paths, you can count on being mugged. And the favelas? Only on organized tours, my friend. They will pick your bones clean in there.
I'm not comparing the Rio of yore to wartime Baghdad or asserting that crime turned travelers away in droves. Rio has been a top tourist spot for decades. The city's tourist ranks swell by the hundreds of thousands for Carnival in February. But crimes targeting tourists rise every year during the raucous festival. And the very prominent word in globe-trotting circles for years has been that in Rio, more than in most major tourist cities, petty crime and fairly violent muggings are serious concerns for visitors.
It's October, and I've come to Rio to see how safe I would feel navigating the city alone. I've traveled extensively, including in some sketchy parts of the world, but I arrived in Brazil feeling nervous. A friend of mine was mugged twice on one visit to Rio five years ago. In the late 1990s, an acquaintance in the air travel industry reported touring the Rio airport and seeing the bodies of children - executed, it was widely believed, by corrupt police on behalf of drug lords - washing against the rocks at the end of a runway, a scene that drew only mild interest from his hosts.
I spend the cab ride to my hotel peering out the window for evidence of a city run by the underworld. 
But I see no such thing.
I do see stark evidence of the yawning class divide here. Ramshackle favelas cling to hills citywide, looking like misplaced puzzle pieces between leafy upscale neighborhoods. The slums - neighborhoods first established by former slaves in the 1700s and notorious in modern times for lawlessness, drug trafficking and violence - have been a priority for city officials who hope to confront crime ahead of the 2014 World Cup (in cities throughout Brazil) and the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio.
In November 2010, police launched the "pacification" program, moving units into the favelas in a major change from the old system of sending in officers to do surgical strikes on known offenders. Stationed in the communities, police are able to build relationships with residents, cultivate sources and earn at least some respect that could translate into less crime. Also, criminals may think twice before committing crimes outside a slum and fleeing into it, knowing that they may be met by police in what was once a relatively safe haven.
The results? For January to September 2011, homicides were down 8 percent compared with the same period the previous year, vehicle theft was down almost 11 percent and robbery followed by homicide was down 30 percent, according to a review by the Rio de Janeiro State Institute of Public Safety.
"I think it's clearly a safer city," says Julia Michaels, who writes a blog on crime in Rio (www.riorealblog.com). "The best indicator of this are real estate prices in and near pacified favelas, which are skyrocketing. [There are] very few stray bullets now, which on a daily basis was one of the worst aspects of life in Rio."
Neighborhoods that were only recently very questionable for tourists to visit have blossomed. One such area is Santa Teresa, where I stayed. The neighborhood spills steeply down from a ridge a few miles north of the main tourist areas of Copacabana and Ipanema. Even a few years ago, drug activity in Santa Teresa's slums prompted guidebooks to advise against walking anywhere in the neighborhood.
I set out from the Hotel Santa Teresa, an upscale property built in a tastefully restored, 150-year-old coffee plantation. Within steps I'm compelled to sneak my camera out of my knapsack for photos of the colonial-style architecture, the stone streets and the sidewalk cafes. I study every passerby, mentally rehearsing my sprint away from the would-be mugger.
But there are no threats or offensive gestures, no indication that anyone cares one iota about me or my belongings. 
The main drag of Santa Teresa winds along the ridge, with colorful art and clothing boutiques abutting cozy restaurants, bakeries and bars. I wander in and out of shops and gradually stop glancing over my shoulder every time I stop to photograph a street scene, a building or the stunning views off either side of the ridge, toward downtown Rio or the distant sea.
Around one corner, on a street of prim pastel houses that recall San Francisco's Marina District, a film crew is shooting a scene for a telenovela. By now I've concluded that, in daylight at least, I have nothing more to fear here than in Takoma Park, where I live.
I climb a flight of stone and tile stairs to the shady patio of Cafecito, an outdoor cafe where casually dressed patrons sip beer and coffee, smoke and write in journals. Joints like this have led Santa Teresa's resurgence as a bohemian hangout.
I have an incredible cup of coffee - a Brazilian brand, Dona Mathilde - and a melt-in-your-mouth smoked trout and cheese sandwich with an olive oil dressing.
The scene is altogether too pleasant. It's time to push the limits. I walk down a long hill, where the street yields to cracked stone stairs. I see trash, graffiti and run-down homes but also tidy rowhouses, open storefronts and locals filing into a church. 
"Crime? It's much better now," says Sandra, a 30-ish Carioca (Rio native) studying to become a judge. I meet her and her boyfriend, Matt, a 50-something expat from San Rafael, Calif., on the Rio subway. "But come 2016, run away."
 Sandra sees the surprise in my eyes. "It's their nature here," she continues. "Once the World Cup and Olympics are done, things will go right back to the way they were."
Some experts share that cynicism. Eliot Brockner, regional manager for the Americas with the risk management firm iJET International, says that police corruption remains a major issue in Rio and that conditions could revert. "There are reputable people out there saying this could work," Brockner says. "But the prevailing sentiment in Rio is that, without a sustained commitment beyond 2016, these gains are temporary."
I notice that Sandra, Matt and most other locals wear jewelry, nice shoes and attractive clothes and carry their purses and shopping bags with nonchalance. 
One morning, I cruise the stalls of a farmers market in the Botafogo neighborhood, sampling tropical fruit from the farms west of Rio. It's a bank holiday - one of the many here that help feed an endless party spirit - and Cariocas are out in force. I walk along the shore of Guanabara Bay, on a path packed with joggers, walkers and cyclists.
In Parque Flamenco, a bay-front forest park, a troupe is performing capoeira, the artfully athletic Brazilian dance, for a small crowd of onlookers. I rent a bicycle from a street-side stand and head toward Copacabana. There, as on all holidays and Sundays, three lanes of the beachfront road are closed to motorized traffic, and skateboarders, roller bladers, street musicians, hawkers and loiterers have taken over. 
Tourists shoot photos and videos, locals yammer on their phones, surfers stroll by, boards under their arms, and the beachfront kiosks that sell cocktails and light fare are packed. The beach is wide, clean and buzzing. Most volleyball nets are in use, many with the traditional version of the game and some with a newer iteration called futevolei, a soccer-volleyball fusion that prohibits using your hands.
Even amid this blazing daylight conviviality, I hesitate before pulling out my camera or wallet. My behavior feels odd even to me, but it's in line with the U.S. State Department's official travel advisory for Rio: 
"The city continues to experience a high incidence of crime. Tourists are particularly vulnerable to street thefts and robberies in areas adjacent to major tourist attractions and on the main beaches in the city. Do not take valuable possessions to the beach. Pay close attention to your surroundings and the behavior of those nearby; there have been incidents of robbers and rapists slipping incapacitating drugs into drinks at bars, hotel rooms, or street parties." 
The agency's advice on favelas is even more pointed: "Most favelas exist outside the control of city officials and police. You should avoid Rio's favelas, even those that have been recently 'pacified' by the state government. Several local companies offer 'favela jeep tours' targeted at foreign tourists. Be aware that neither the tour company nor the city police can guarantee your safety when entering favelas, and that favela tour fees may ultimately be used to support criminal gang activities."
I'm glad I didn't read that before venturing into Vidigal.
I cycle the streets of Copacabana, where the mature trees, street bustle and mishmash architecture evoke flashes of New Orleans and Manhattan, marred by haphazard urban planning. 
Ornate cathedrals and residences, some dating from the 19th century, sit among drab, blocky apartment buildings and hotels from a 1950s construction boom. The sidewalks buck with cracks and crevices, and the curiously abundant manhole covers are, per the State Department advisory, prone to blasting into the air because of explosions of pent-up gas beneath the streets.
I stop in at an apartment building to see my friend Lucille, who moved to Rio from Washington eight years ago, sensing the growing economic opportunity in the Brazilian city. She and her boyfriend, who now have a toddler and an infant, bought a penthouse in central Copacabana last year.
"We never would have moved here six years ago," she says when I ask about security. "It's better, but that's relative to what it used to be." She and her boyfriend were mugged a few years back in Santa Teresa but, she says, "we ignored all the signs" - an increasingly deserted street, shady loiterers, etc. 
Her building, like most apartments in Copacabana and Ipanema, is gated and guarded, but her au pair walks her son to the beach every day, and the streets, bustling with lawful activity, feel safe for strolling, even when we head out at night for dinner. 
As for my Vidigal foray, I credit Washington Post foreign correspondent Juan Forero with inspiring that. In October, he reported on a tourist guesthouse that had recently opened at the top of the favela. On the phone, Andreas Wielend, the owner of Casa Alto Vidigal, tells me to come by and not to worry about crime. "Grab a moto taxi at the bottom of the hill," he says. "You'll be fine."
To be honest, I fear for my life in Vidigal, but only during my cardiac-arrest ride up to the guest house on the back of a motorcycle: I dig my fingernails into the seat and lean into my driver, who races up the steep, curving hills, weaving around traffic, people and dogs as though he were in the championship round of a video game tournament. When his bike stalls two-thirds of the way up, I hop off, make the sign of the cross and start to hurry away, not caring where I'm headed. But he restarts his steed and insists that we finish the journey.
From the patio of whimsically painted Casa Alto Vidigal, with its captivating hilltop views of the slum and the Ipanema beach beyond, Jorge Melendez, a Peruvian transplant who helps run the guesthouse, tells me that "you are much safer here" than in other parts of Rio. "The drug dealers here want to work; they would never allow [crimes against tourists] in the favela" because of the police attention it would draw. 
Hang around long enough, Melendez says, and "you will see the guns, the drugs, the traffickers patrolling. Believe me, they see you. But they don't really bother anyone."
So, I ask, I could walk out of here and nothing bad would happen to me? "Right," he answers. "I mean, I wouldn't start shooting pictures everywhere. That might arouse suspicion. But, yes. Follow that path" - he waves a meaty arm toward the steep and uneven concrete staircase - "and you will get down."
I emerge onto Vidigal's main artery, where I sense an aura of community that I hadn't felt elsewhere in the city: Instead of small bands of people frolicking in closed circles, here is an entire village pulsing as a single unit. I'm not romanticizing poverty - and for Rio to succeed in the long term, favela residents will need something more than police embedded as neighbors - but there is a palpable sense in Vidigal of a shared destiny, and with it a shared commitment to making the best of it.
 The kids playing, the moto taxis whizzing, the shop owners milling, the music wafting from speakers jury-rigged to overhead power lines - altogether it comes off like an opera.
 I don't want to leave just yet, so I sit down in an austere concrete cafe on Vidigal's main street, order a plate of fish and tap my foot to the rhythms of Brazilian street life.

The risk

BYLINE: Ann Hornaday

SECTION: STYLE; Pg. T01

"What I really want is some food!" Angelina Jolie is walking into a big, empty room in New York's Waldorf Astoria Hotel, dressed like a businesswoman prepped for a meeting in a tailored black daytime suit and high-heeled black pumps. And it's true: The lady needs to eat, her famously lithe frame having become thinner, paler, more birdlike since the last time we talked, a year and a half ago when the action thriller "Salt" came out.
A generous buffet will magically appear in the hall outside, but for now Jolie must content herself with a small bottle of water that she idly seesaws up and down while talking about her new movie. Not "her new movie" in the usual sense that it's her famously puckered lips plastered on billboards from L.A. to Lesotho. Rather "her new movie" in the sense that she wrote, directed and produced it.  
"In the Land of Blood and Honey," which opened Friday, stars a cast of virtually complete unknowns, actors from the former Yugoslavia who appear in a story about the Bosnian-Serbian conflict in 1992. It's a rigorous, sometimes raw look at life during wartime at its most senseless, an often startlingly effective portrait not just of atrocities that included rape, sexual humiliation and gratuitous killings, but of stark international apathy. In many ways Jolie's film resembles "Hotel Rwanda," about a similar instance of collective paralysis in the face of unimaginable violence.
"The crux of the story was my frustration with lack of intervention," says Jolie, the bottle of water tipping back and forth in her small hand. "I spent so much time with people in post-conflict situations where I wish I could just turn back the clock, before they were so scarred, and before so many losses." She wants audiences to experience her own feelings firsthand, so that "if you're watching the film," she says, "you're thinking, 'Can somebody please stop this? It's getting worse, I want to get out of this theater, I just want to get out of here!' "
But first, of course, she wants to get people into the theater, not an easy proposition for a subtitled drama in Bosnian, Serbian and Croatian, about a war that took place in a faraway place and time, featuring actors American audiences have never heard of. After shying away from initially exploiting her celebrity, she's now a ubiquitous presence on the movie-marketing hustings, showing up for awards ceremonies, interviews and, just last week, when she and her partner, Brad Pitt, attended a special screening at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum.
"I didn't do this film because I wanted to direct or be a director," Jolie says. "I didn't even intend on doing that when I wrote it. [Brad and I] kind of joked about it, because it seemed so impossible for me to write a film that would become a movie. We said, we're going to send it to people from all sides of the conflict with my name off of it. If they agree, we'll consider making a film, and if they don't, we'll throw it in the trash. . . . I've tried to do the best I could, and I feel this is a representation of who I am. Most of the films I do are [about] characters that I have fun with, but are not representative of who I am and what I believe."

The global family 
It may be surprising that Jolie's first film would be a subtitled, politically complex war drama rather than a frothy vanity production (imagine if Elizabeth Taylor, at the height of her glamour and obsessively publicized marriage to Richard Burton, had made a little art-house movie about the My Lai massacre). But to anyone who has tracked Jolie's career, it's utterly predictable. Over the past decade, the 36-year-old actress has transcended her beginnings as a creature of Hollywood to become a bona fide global figure - an international superstar, humanitarian activist and matriarch of a family that hails from and roams all parts of the world like its own self-contained G-8. (Jolie's three adopted children are from Cambodia, Ethiopia and Vietnam; her biological children were born in Namibia and France, respectively.)
"My family, we met around the world and we were drawn to each other," Jolie explains, recalling when she was filming "Lara Croft: Tomb Raider" in Cambodia and "just knew my son was in this country somewhere. It wasn't intentional, it just felt right." 
In 2001, she traveled to Tanzania. "I was concerned about the situation in Sierra Leone, and I called the U.N. and asked to go in," she says. "And I came back very, very different."
This was also the time that, having won an Oscar for her supporting turn in "Girl, Interrupted," Jolie exploded as a huge international box office star, the kind of electrifying presence who sells tickets all over the world. (The middling thriller "The Tourist," which Jolie made with fellow global superstar Johnny Depp, was considered a flop in the United States, having grossed a mere $68million; worldwide it earned more than $275 million.) 
At the Cannes Film Festival last year, Jolie accompanied Pitt to the premiere of "The Tree of Life," poured into a slinky black dress andworking the ropeline like a consummate pro, patiently waving, smiling and posing for cellphone pictures. Even after Pitt had departed - even after Jolie herself had been pulled away - she came back for more interaction with the fans.
The day before, Jolie had been in a meeting about "In the Land of Blood and Honey" with Bob Berney, then president of FilmDistrict, the film's distributor, talking about logistics and details. "Then the next night she was on the red carpet and it looked like the Red Sea parting," Berney recalls. "She knows exactly what to do in a crowd. She can put on a show." Great stars such as Jolie "respect the fans," Berney continues. "They treat 'em in the right way and that's why they're popular. I think it's genuine, and that's what people will hopefully pick up from her promoting this movie that she genuinely cares about."

A worldview evolves
And now, as if her directorial debut wasn't already at odds with that red-carpet persona, Jolie makes a movie dealing with one of the most complicated, poorly understood episodes in the recent but forgotten past - a story fraught with potential tribal, historical and political missteps that could trip up even the most seasoned international stateswoman. Not only is Jolie taking an artistic leap, she's risking the considerable store of credibility she's built up since becoming a goodwill ambassador for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in 2001 (she's also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations).
At a screening in Washingtonof "In the Land of Blood and Honey" a few days before our interview, a representative of the Endeavor Group, hired by Jolie to help shape the communications campaign around the film, welcomed a group of Bosnian women recruited to share their opinions "so Angie knows how people are reacting to the film and how she should discuss it." 
After explaining why Jolie made the movie ("the conflict isn't over in her mind"), the representative says, "This is not a documentary, it's a piece of art, so we hope you keep that in mind," adding that Jolie "is nervous about how the film is going to be received, and whether people will understand why she did the film."
Jolie admits: "I am nervous about it, but the cast is representative of this part of the world. So when they saw it the first time, I was terribly nervous. And they're very supportive." 
Goran Kostic, who plays a reluctant Serbian soldier in "In the Land of Blood and Honey," grew up in Sarajevo, the son of a Serbian military officer. He recalls that, while they were shooting the film, Jolie "would come to me every now and then and say, 'Am I stepping on somebody's toes here?' And I said, 'Angie, whatever you do in the Balkans, you will always get somebody [angry], so you might as well step on everybody's toes just to make sure!'
"I think those whose heart is in the right place, and those who can have enough objectivity, in Serbia and Bosnia and Croatia and in the wider region, they'll find a value in all these issues having been raised," Kostic says. "For us it's a personal story, for Angelina this is a global story." 
Even if "In the Land of Blood and Honey" does wind up stepping on a few toes, Jolie has steeled herself for whatever controversy may ensue. "You certainly don't want things you do and your good intentions to be misinterpreted, and for it to inflame the situation," she says. "But there are a lot of people who need to be heard and want to have a discussion, and I feel that even people who disagree with the film will have a bigger voice. So I'm happy for that - that even if they disagree with me, and with the film, they will have more of a platform and we can talk about it." 

'The way to raise people'
Jolie is getting ready to go - but then stops short when a question about American exceptionalism comes up. "I think it's wrong," she says flatly, and that leads her to a related thought. "I'm surprised there isn't a watch on textbooks. . . . I home-school my kids now, and really have cracked down on the history books, making sure that they get not my view, but a balanced view and, because they're from other countries, that they're proud of their countries. Because that's the way to raise people. 
"If you're raised thinking you're the only country that did great things and you're the only people that do great things, then . . . it causes isolationism and violence," she continues, grabbing her bag. "I don't know if it's the U.N. or what, but there's got to be some international check just to make sure you're not inciting violence."
With that, Angelina Jolie is off - to check on her kids who are playing down the hall, then presumably to make a few calls to see if she can turn another frustration into an idea, and that idea into a reality.

Judge rejects challenge to gun-sales rules

BYLINE: Del Quentin Wilber

SECTION: METRO; Pg. C04

LENGTH: 417 words

A federal judge has thrown out a lawsuit challenging new reporting requirements for gun dealers that the Obama administration says are needed to help staunch the flow of powerful rifles to violent Mexican drug gangs. 
Ruling in a suit brought by gun dealers and backed by the National Shooting Sports Foundation as well as the National Rifle Association, U.S. District Judge Rosemary M. Collyer of the D.C. district said  Friday that the new rules were a reasonable law enforcement tactic.
The suit stemmed from reporting requirements issued in July that required about 8,500 gun dealers in Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas to alert federal officials to sales of multiple semiautomatic rifles to the same person within five business days. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which mandated the reporting, says that many of the guns used by Mexican drug cartels are purchased from dealers along the border and that obtaining sales data will help authorities more quickly trace seized weapons and investigate associated crimes.
Within weeks of the new rules being made public, gun dealers filed suit to block them. They argued that the requirements exceeded ATF's authority and that Congress never intended there to be a national registration of firearms sales.
Collyer, appointed to the bench by President George W. Bush in 2003, sided with the government, writing that the regulations did not "disturb the balance" between ATF's efforts to regulate firearms and the privacy rights of gun owners. "ATF determined that certain powerful long guns are weapons of choice for Mexican drug cartels," Collyer wrote, "and that multiple sales of such guns is a strong indicator of gun trafficking."
"ATF acted rationally" in asking for sales data in the border states, the judge added.
The NSSF said in a statement Friday that it will appeal the ruling. "Today's ruling will allow ATF to demand whatever information it wants from any law-abiding retailer anywhere in the country for any reason ATF wants simply by sending a letter demanding information," the organization said in a statement on its Web site.
"While we understand ATF's motivation is to try to curtail violence in Mexico, Congress simply has not granted ATF regulatory carte blanche," the NSSF said.

General's latest fight is against alcoholism

BYLINE: Mitch Weiss

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A20

LENGTH: 549 words

DATELINE: CHARLOTTE, N.C.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. - Retired Brig. Gen. Stanley Cherrie flew into machine-gun fire, lost a leg to a land mine and directed tanks against Iraqi forces during his long Army career. When he walked into a reunion of top brass looking shaky and then collapsed, another side of his military life was revealed: years of hard drinking had grown into alcoholism that nearly killed him.
Cherrie's breakdown in front of his comrades, who had gathered to mark the 20th anniversary of Operation Desert Storm, triggered his turn to rehabilitation from a habit that started a generation earlier. Now, the man who commanded troops in Kuwait and Bosnia despite the prosthetic leg he got in Vietnam is sharing his story, in part as an example for a new cohort of soldiers coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan. 
"I always knew I drank too much. In retrospect, I was the poster boy. If you wanted to build a functional alcoholic, you would follow my model," said Cherrie, 69.
The turning point came at the reunion of officers who planned Operation Desert Storm, the 1990 military campaign that ousted Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's invading forces from Kuwait. Minutes after sitting down to eat, Cherrie collapsed at the table.  Army Surgeon General Eric Schoomaker was on hand and treated Cherrie before an ambulance whisked him to a nearby emergency room.
At the hospital, Cherrie's daughter asked to speak to Schoomaker in private, where she disclosed http://www.health.mil/Content/docs/schoomaker.pdfa family secret to the Army's ranking medical officer: Her father was an alcoholic, and years of drinking had taken a toll.
It was the beginning of Cherrie's long journey back to sobriety from a thirst that began in Vietnam, where as a young officer he stepped on a land mine that blew apart his right leg, right hand and part of his left heel. Cherrie managed to stay in the military at a time when disabled soldiers were routinely discharged, working his way up the ranks.
As he comes to grips now with the pain he caused his family, he has another even more daunting challenge: caring for his wife, Mary Ellen, who is battling a degenerative arthritic condition. High school sweethearts, they have been married 46 years.
Cherrie's fight for sobriety helps illustrate a larger problem - as troops return home from Iraq and Afghanistan, many have turned to alcohol to help relieve the pain.
Schoomaker, who headed the Army medical command from 2007 until December, says drinking remains a problem in the military, but there are efforts to change that. Three years ago, for example, the Army created a pilot program at six bases that allows soldiers to seek outpatient drug and alcohol treatment without telling their commanders.
"The culture has shifted dramatically, where alcohol use is openly discouraged in a public kind of way. But it's not in any shape or form been eliminated," he said.
For his part, Cherrie is using his experience to help others.
"I think Stan wants to get his story out because when he screws up he wants people to know it as a learning experience," said his friend John Harris, a retired lieutenant colonel. "He's not looking for sympathy. He's not looking for notoriety. He's looking at it as: 'How can my story help someone [else] who is going through a similar situation?' "

In war, we all desecrate the enemy

BYLINE: Sebastian Junger

SECTION: OUTLOOK; Pg. B01

LENGTH: 911 words

The video that emerged in recent days appearing to show four U.S. Marines urinating on several dead Taliban fighters has outraged many people in this country. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta have condemned the act, the military has promised an inquiry, and some experts are even suggesting that the actcould qualify as a war crime.
Mainly, however, people seem simply to not understand it. Why would America's warriors - for that matter, why would anyone - urinate on a dead body? 
I spent a year, off and on, with a platoon of U.S. soldiers in the Korengal Valley of eastern Afghanistan. There was a lot of fighting, a lot of casualties and an enormous amount of stress on the men I was with. I never saw anyone do anything like this, but then again, I never saw any dead Taliban fighters - the enemy always recovered their casualties before we could get there.
Nevertheless, the things the soldiers shouted during combat were very revealing of the state of mind that war produces. (For the record, I'm sure the Taliban was screaming pretty much the same things about us.) At one point a Taliban fighter had his leg shot off during a firefight and was crawling around on the hillside, dying, and the men I was with cheered at the sight. That cheer deflated me. I liked these guys tremendously, but that celebration was just so ugly. I didn't want them to be like that.
Later, I asked one of them about it, and he explained that they had been happy because they were that much closer to all going home alive. They weren't cheering the enemy's death; they were cheering their own lives. That particular fighter would never again be able to kill an American soldier.
In a statement issued Thursday, Gen. Jim Amos, the Marine Corps commandant, said that "the behavior depicted in the video is wholly inconsistent with the high standards of conductand warrior ethos that we have demonstrated throughout our history."
Yet, I can't imagine that there was a time in human history when enemy dead were not desecrated. Achilles dragged Hector around the walls of Troy from the back of a chariot because he was so enraged by Hector's killing of his best friend. Three millennia later, Somali fighters dragged a U.S. soldier through the streets of Mogadishu after shooting down a Black Hawk helicopter and killing 17 other Americans. During the frontier wars in this country, white Americans routinely scalped Indian fighters, and vice versa, well into the 1870s.
The U.S. military should be held to a higher standard, certainly, but it is important to understand the context of the behavior in the video. Clearly, the impulse to desecrate the enemy comes from a very dark and primal place in the human psyche. Once in a while, those impulses are going to break through.
There is another context for that behavior, though - a more contemporary one. As a society, we may be disgusted by seeing U.S. Marines urinating on dead Taliban fighters, but we remain oddly unfazed by the fact that, presumably, those same Marines just put high-caliber rounds through the fighters' chests. American troops are not blind to this irony. They are very clear about the fact that society trains them to kill, orders them to kill and then balks at anything that suggests they have dehumanized the enemy they have killed.
But of course they have dehumanized the enemy - otherwise they would have to face the enormous guilt and anguish of killing other human beings. Rather than demonstrate a callous disregard for the enemy, this awful incident might reveal something else: a desperate attempt by confused young men to convince themselves that they haven't just committed their first murder - that they have simply shot some coyotes on the back 40.
It doesn't work, of course, but it gets them through the moment; it gets them through the rest of the patrol.
There is a final context for this act in which we are all responsible, all guilty. A 19-year-old Marine has a very hard time reconciling the fact that it's okay to waterboard a live Taliban fighter but not okay to urinate on a dead one.
When the war on terror started, the Marines in that video were probably 9 or 10 years old. As children they heard adults - and political leaders - talk about our enemies in the most inhuman terms. The Internet and the news media are filled with self-important men and women referring to our enemies as animals that deserve little legal or moral consideration. We have sent enemy fighters  to countries like Syria and Libya to be tortured by the very regimes that we have recently condemned for engaging in war crimes and torture. They have been tortured into confessing their crimes and then locked up indefinitely without trial because their confessions - achieved through torture - will not stand up in court.
For the past 10 years, American children have absorbed these moral contradictions, and now they are fighting our wars. The video doesn't surprise me, but it makes me incredibly sad - not just for them, but also for us. We may prosecute these men for desecrating the dead while maintaining that it is okay to torture the living.
I hope someone else knows how to explain that to our soldiers, because I don't have the faintest idea.

George Hamilton, game for the 'La Cage' match

BYLINE: Kevin Nance

SECTION: SUNDAY ARTS; Pg. E05

LENGTH: 1297 words

George Hamilton is nothing if not a good sport. For 30 years, the actor has played along in a national running joke about his mahogany tan - which at its darkest, admittedly, made John Boehner look like Casper the Friendly Ghost. In 2006, Hamilton's agent questioned his sanity when he persisted on "Dancing With the Stars" despite his advancing years, a bum knee and shooting pains from his groin to his feet. "I can do anything," he insisted, "for a minute fifty-six."
Now, although he has top billing in the national tour of "La Cage aux Folles" (which starts performances Tuesday at the Kennedy Center's Eisenhower Theater), Hamilton, 72, freely acknowledges being eclipsed nightly by his far younger but more stage-savvy co-star, Christopher Sieber. 
In this new production of the 1983 Jerry Herman/Harvey Fierstein musical, Hamilton plays Georges, the owner of a drag revue whose leading lady, Zaza, is also Albin, Georges's lover. While Sieber has been delivering the performance of his life as Albin/Zaza - he gives Herman's anthemic first-act closer, "I Am What I Am," the dramatic heft of "Rose's Turn" - Hamilton has struggled with a torn Achilles tendon, difficulty remembering lines and a persistent sense of playing catch-up with a cast of Broadway triple-threats, Sieber in particular. (Adding to Hamilton's insecurity, perhaps, is the fact that the "massively talented" Sieber, as Hamilton calls him, played Georges on Broadway, starring in the revival's second cast opposite Fierstein as Albin.) And while Sieber has been collecting rave reviews the way Zaza collects feather boas, Hamilton's notices have been mixed at best, at worst vitriolic.
But if Hamilton is not quite undaunted, he's also game, the definition of a trouper at his most determined. "I can't say the reviews are wrong, but I can say that within a few weeks, I'll be on top of this," he says in a recent interview in his suite at Chicago's Palmer House Hilton, a block from the scene of his evening trials onstage. "When you arrive in New York, you have four weeks of rehearsal, you have dancing, you haven't sung onstage in years, and you have to go out there and hit those marks with a cast that's done the show on Broadway. You're on your back foot, and in my case, on my heel. And I thought, 'What are you going to do, George? Get out of this, or go on?' For me, the challenge was worth it. I'm only good when I'm behind. If I go down in flames, so be it, but I don't think that's going to happen. I would bet on me." 
So would his co-star. "George is 72 years old, but he's out there doing it every night, and he's getting better all the time," says Sieber, a two-time Tony nominee (for "Spamalot" and "Shrek the Musical"). "Zaza is a great role, obviously, but Georges is actually the harder part to play, because he has to drive the show - he's the ringmaster in almost every scene. There's a lot more that's under the surface than you might think, and I think George is finding a lot of that. He's also, by the way, the most generous, most self-deprecating person I've ever worked with. There's not a diva bone in his body."
Hamilton's humility and good humor are on display at the Palmer House, where he arrived slightly late for his interview after shopping for a new pair of Skechers, a necessity because of the constant wrapping and unwrapping of his still painfully injured foot. When a visitor notes the absence of a limp, Hamilton flashes his famous blinding smile and says, "That's acting!" 
In 90 minutes, he ranges over highlights of a half-century-long career that began when he became one of the last contract players in the old Hollywood studio system. He's a free-associational memory machine, with almost every question eliciting not one anecdote but two or three. Having hot tea and lemon to keep his singing voice in shape? It reminds him of the night in the early '60s when he found himself in the steamroom at the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas with Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Vic Damone and Peter Lawford. "They all had different theories about how to keep their voices healthy," Hamilton recalls. "Vic was sucking a raw egg through a pinhole in the shell - he believed it kept the vocal cords lubricated. Frank was having Jack Daniels. Sammy didn't do anything for his voice - he could have gargled with razor blades and sung all night."
A question about the "La Cage" tour's next stop, in Washington, leads to his J. Edgar Hoover story, circa 1966. Hamilton was dating Lynda Bird Johnson at the time, and her father, the sitting president, arranged for his daughter and her new beau to pay a social call to the famed FBI director, who repeated the slogan about the Bureau always getting its man. Two weeks later, a photograph of the visit arrived in the mail with the inscription: To George Hamilton IV - Best Regards, Your Friend, J. Edgar Hoover. "Well, George Hamilton IV is a country singer," he says with a smile. "Hoover got the wrong man."
The stories keep coming. The day he got married in the Vegas hotel suite of "Colonel" Tom Parker, Elvis Presley's manager, with Parker as his best man. The time he auditioned for "On a Clear Day You Can See Forever" at the request of Alan Jay Lerner, who fell asleep in the middle of a song. The time his "Home From the Hill" co-star, Robert Mitchum, told him, "I know the lines, I'm just too drunk to say 'em." His early dramatic roles, which eventually gave way to a new reputation as a crack comedian in a pair of Golden Globe-nominated turns in 1979's "Love at First Bite" - in which he played a disco-dancing Dracula loving the nightlife in New York - and 1981's "Zorro: The Gay Blade," in which the sidelined hero is replaced by his flamboyantly gay twin brother, who taunts his opponents not only with the sword and bullwhip but with dainty ditties. ("Two bits, four bits, six bits, a peso! All those for Zorro, stand up and say so!")
Those triumphs were eclipsed, in turn, by the pop-cultural phenomenon of the Hamil-Tan. The comic strip "Doonesbury" sent up the actor as the glowing guru of a tanning-master workshop in Malibu - Garry Trudeau sent him the proofs - while Australia's Dame Edna Everage, on one of her American comedy specials, rushed from her Hollywood mansion to rescue her next-door neighbor, who was trapped in his tanning bed. "Smells like someone's grilling some scrummy hamburgers," Dame Edna drawled before exclaiming in mock horror, "Wait! It's George Hamilton!"
Remembering it all now, Hamilton - whose tan these days is achieved primarily with a bronzer, which he wears onstage in "La Cage aux Folles" in lieu of makeup - shrugs. "When your tan becomes an icon of American pop culture, what's there to do? It helps to keep a sense of humor, which gives you the detachment to see the bigger picture."
In the case of "La Cage," the bigger picture is connected, for Hamilton, to his half brother, William "Bill" Potter, a mostly closeted gay man who died in the 1980s after a six-month hospitalization for liver and kidney failure, with only Hamilton at his side; other members of the family, including their mother, couldn't accept his sexuality. "In one of the last conversations we had, I asked him, 'What would you do if you had it to do all over again?' And he said, 'I would love more,' " Hamilton recalls, a catch in his throat. "And that's what 'La Cage' is about, after all. It's not about gay or straight. It's about family, about living your life and finding love, and about standing up for yourself, for who you are."
And with that, Hamilton stands up, glancing at his watch. It's time to head back to the theater, have his foot wrapped and walk back into the lights with every appearance of supreme confidence. Now, that's acting.

Police: Suspect tied to killings of homeless
 A Southern California police official said Saturday that investigators are "extremely confident" a man in their custody is responsible for all four recent killings of homeless men in Orange County. 
Anaheim Police Chief John Welter said investigators have tied the killings to 23-year-old Itzcoatl Ocampo of Yorba Linda. Ocampo was detained Friday night after a fourth homeless man was found slain in a fast-food restaurant's parking lot.
Authorities say witnesses and bystanders at the crime scene chased Ocampo on foot, and he was captured by an officer who was part of a perimeter.
Three other homeless men have been found stabbed to death in north Orange County since mid-December, and a task force of police officers, sheriff's deputies and FBI agents had been looking for the single suspect they believed was responsible for all three.
Ocampo could not immediately be reached for comment. A phone number listed in his name rang without an answer, and no one answered the door at two addresses listed in his name.

Barbour defends final-days pardons
Former Mississippi governor Haley Barbour said Friday that he's "very comfortable" with his final-days decisions to grant pardons or other clemency to more than 200 people, including convicted killers - decisions that outraged victims' families and dismayed even some of his most devoted supporters.
Barbour, a Republican who had considered but decided against running for president this year, said that 189 of the people who got pardons or other reprieves had already been released from prison before his actions. Only 10, he said, have been or will be fully released from prison, while several with expensive, chronic conditions are receiving medical leave.
 "I am fully confident the pardons and other clemency I have given are all valid," Barbour told reporters at a news conference, his first on the subject.
Barbour granted pardons and other reprieves in his final days before leaving office after two terms Tuesday. Five inmates who had worked as trusties at the Governor's Mansion - four of them convicted of murder - were released last weekend. One of the freed men had fatally shot his estranged wife as she held their baby in 1993.

Lincoln check found in bank vault: A personal check that Abraham Lincoln wrote the day before he was assassinated is among those that were rediscovered by an Ohio bank. The Plain Dealer in Cleveland reports that 70 checks were found in a vault at Huntington Bank's Columbus headquarters, including checks signed by George Washington, Mark Twain, Charles Dickens and Thomas Edison. The Lincoln check had been made out to "self" for $800. The checks had been stored in a vault since at least 1983, when Huntington took over another bank. An employee had begun looking through old boxes last year, which led to the discovery of the checks.

Insurgents attackRamadi police station
Insurgents stormed the western Iraqi city of Ramadi on Sunday and tried to blast their way into a police compound, setting off a fierce gun battle with security forces. Eight policemen and seven insurgents were killed, according to government and security officials.
"It was a bold attack, surprising attack," said Brig. Gen. Khamis Jasem, a commander at a provincial operations center. "They made the security forces busy with explosives here and there. Then they attacked." 
Six civilians were killed, said Maj. Mahmoud Khaleel of the Anbar provincial police. Security officials have increased their readiness, particularly in the nearby city of Fallujah. "We are expecting similar attacks in the coming days," Jasem added.
Sunday's assault, in a predominantly Sunni area, followed a huge blast Saturday outsidethe southern city of Basra that killed at least 53 Shiite pilgrims on a march to a religious shrine. 
The Ramadi assault began just before noon, said Khaleel, the police major. An explosives-laden car detonated outside an Investment Commission building. Another car bomb blew up outside Ramadi's main water tank, Khaleel said. After several more  charges erupted, a suicide bomber detonated his blasting vest outside the main gate of the city's police compound. 
The insurgent was trying to clear the way for others. But police repelled the advance, Khaleel said, and chased the insurgents into a nearby empty building. They killed seven insurgents, said Hakmet Jassim, deputy governor of province, but two remained at large Sunday evening.

New party on trackto enter parliament
At least one new party will enter Kazakhstan's parliament after an election that offered a small concession to democracy, following deadly riots by oil workers that shook the country's stable image.
Exit polls after Sunday's election in the vast Central Asian nation put the party of long-serving president Nursultan Nazarbayev on course to win by a landslide. But they also suggested that two other parties broadly sympathetic to the government, the pro-business Ak Zhol and the Communist People's Party, could enter the lower house.
At least one of them will have seats, because for the first time the second-place party will be guaranteed representation, regardless of whether it clears the 7 percent threshold for entering the assembly. The president's party, Nur Otan, currently holds all the seats.

E.U. will press Iran, British secretary says
Britain's foreign secretary said Sunday that European nations will intensify pressure on Iran over its nuclear program but insisted the West was not urging military action.
William Hague told Sky News television that he believed the European Union would agree to adopt tough new sanctions against Tehran's oil sector this month and would continue to look for peaceful ways to persuade Iran to ditch its pursuit of a nuclear weapon.
Iran insists its nuclear program is intended solely for peaceful purposes, but the West and others accuse it of attempting to build a bomb.

Father of suspect in killings is homeless
The father of a man suspected of killing homeless men in Southern California is himself homeless and says his son showed him a picture last week of one victim as a warning of the danger of being on the streets. 
Refugio Ocampo, 49, said Sunday that his son came back a changed man after serving with the Marines in Iraq.
The father said he lost his job and home and ended up living under a bridge before finding shelter in the cab of a broken-down tractor-trailer he is helping to repair.
His 23-year-old son, Itzcoatl Ocampo, was arrested Friday in connection with the serial killings of four homeless men since late December.

2 adults, 2 children found fatally shot
Police in California's Central Valley say two adults and two children are dead after an apparent murder-suicide, and a fifth person is hospitalized in critical condition.
The Fresno Bee reports that when police were called to investigate a disturbance at a Fresno apartment shortly before 7 a.m. Sunday, they found a man outside the residence with a stab wound.
Capt. Dennis Bridges said officers then heard a single gunshot. When they went inside the apartment, they found a woman believed to be in her 20s with a self-inflicted gunshot wound and a man in his 20s or 30s dead of a gunshot wound. Two children - an 18-month-old and a 3-year-old - also were fatally shot.

Two men held in Mont. teacher's disappearance: New details about the disappearance and reported death of a Montana math teacher began to trickle out Sunday, as authorities asked property owners in parts of North Dakota and Montana to look for signs of her buried body, and released the names of two men being held in the case. The FBI issued a statement saying the body of Sherry Arnold, 43, may be buried in a "shelter belt," or a line of trees that protects soil from the wind. The agency asked that property owners in the North Dakota counties of Williams, McKenzie and Mountrail counties, and in far northeastern Montana check vacant farms for disturbed soil or matted grass. Lester Vann Waters Jr., 47, and Michael Keith Spell, 22, both of Parachute, Colo., are at the Williams County Correctional Center in Williston, N.D., awaiting extradition to Montana.

Egypt's top general is set to visit Libya

DATELINE: CAIRO

CAIRO - In his first major trip abroad as acting head of state, Egypt's top general is scheduled to fly to Libya on Monday for talks with interim leaders there on the cross-border flow of weapons and the return of Egyptian laborers who fled by the thousands during the Libyan revolution.
Field Marshal Mohammed Hussein Tantawi's expected meeting in Tripoli with Libya's Transitional National Council highlights the important relationship between the two nations in transition and their shared concerns over the proliferation of weapons across the porous border from Libya into Egypt. 
"Such a big visit is more than overdue," an Egyptian Foreign Affairs Ministry official said Sunday. "We cannot have stability on our borders without cooperation."
Tantawi and Egypt's other ruling generals have drawn criticism at home for what opponents say has been their reluctance to move toward democratic rule. But Tantawi's trip was widely seen here as essential to repairing economic cooperation between the two countries and not as an indication that the general was trying to expand his authority.
"He is making his visit as the head of the military council, which is the institution managing Egypt's transitional phase," said Hassan Abu Taleb, an analyst at al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies, adding that the trip did not amount to Tantawi trying to assert presidential powers.
About 1 million Egyptians were working in the oil-rich North African nation when the uprising against the late authoritarian leader, Moammar Gaddafi, began in February. Egyptians have depended heavily on the labor market in Libya for work, and remittances from Libya have been a vital part of the Egyptian economy, which is now faltering.
"We have hundreds of thousands of Egyptians who want to return to Libya to participate in rebuilding the country," said the Egyptian Foreign Affairs Ministry official, who was not authorized to speak publicly. "Libya needs manpower for reconstruction, and we are the primary candidate."
Tantawi is to travel to Libya with eight cabinet members, including the ministers of foreign affairs, electricity and labor. He is scheduled to meet with the head of the transitional council, Mustafa Abdel Jalil, as well as the Libyan prime minister, Abdurrahim el-Keib, and other Libyan cabinet ministers.
Other than a visit to Saudi Arabia in October to pay respects after the death of Prince Sultan bin Abdul Aziz al-Saud, this is Tantawi's first official visit to a foreign country since the generals took control of Egypt last February. Egypt's foreign minister visited Libya in September, and the head of the Libyan governing council visited Egypt in late October.
Tantawi is expected to raise concerns about weapons that are moving into Egypt from Libya, Egyptian military and foreign ministry officials said. The weapons have traveled mainly through Bedouin smuggling operations, and many end up in the mostly lawless lands of the northern Sinai Peninsula, military officials have said. The Bedouin routes supply weapons, food and consumer goods to both Egyptians and Palestinians. Of chief concern - to Egyptian officials as well as neighboring Israelis - are surface-to-air missile systems.
Late last year, Sinai's clandestine market included rockets and antiaircraft guns smuggled from Libya, according to military officials and smugglers interviewed in the fall. Egyptian security officials have seized ammunition, explosives, automatic weapons and caches of heavier arms, including Russian-made Strela-2 and Strela-3 heat-seeking, shoulder-fired antiaircraft missiles. In recent months the smuggling has decreased, according to a brigadier general in the Egyptian army who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.
"We want to stop it and to have more coordination," the officer said.
Loose weapons have emerged as one of Libya's main security problems since the abrupt collapse of Gaddafi's security forces. Libyan weapons teams working with experts from the United States have so far recovered 5,000 missiles known as manpads (man-portable air-defense systems), which can pose a serious threat to aircraft, according to a State Department official. But it is impossible to know how many remain missing, said the official, who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.
Britain, Canada, the Netherlands and Germany have contributed more than $5.1 million to help Libyans with technical support to secure surface-to-air missile systems, the official said. Others, including NATO and the European Union, are working to help identify areas with unsecured weapons.
The United States has also been working with Egypt as well as other Libyan neighbors to "reduce proliferation across the region," the State Department official said.

On Lobby Day, pros give way to amateurs

DATELINE: RICHMOND

RICHMOND - There were boisterous rallies and quiet tete-a-tetes, live animals and biker leather, little stickers and big signs, and so many guns that police designated a special door for everyone entering the Capitol armed.
Lobby Day at the General Assembly drew thousands of Virginians, who descended upon Richmond on Monday as they do every year for a day devoted to amateur arm-twisting.
Professional lobbyists troll Richmond's marble corridors every day of the _blankGeneral Assembly session. Monday was for those pushing causes without the benefit of a paycheck or expense account, a day when ordinary citizens could drop by offices without an appointment and expect to get an audience with a senator or delegate. 
"History is made by those who show up, and you showed up," Bob Sadtler, gun-show coordinator for the Virginia Citizens Defense League, told hundreds of gun-rights activists who rallied at the brick bell tower on Capitol Square. They wore stickers that read "Guns Save Lives" and "Freedom is not a Loophole."
Two hours later, about 50 people gathered at the same spot to pay homage to the victims of gun violence. Many wore large yellow stickers reading "Background Checks Save Lives" or scarves in the maroon and orange of _blankVirginia Tech, where 32 people were shot to death in 2007.
Passionate lobbying went on inside the Capitol, where the _blanklegislative session got underwaylast week. Inside the General Assembly Building, some groups had information booths, as if it were a trade show. The showstopper was the Virginia Living Museum, which had a live rabbit and great horned owl on display, along with skunk, raccoon and bear skins.
Terry "Rock" Moeslein, assistant education director at the private zoo, planetarium and observatory in Newport News, hoped the abbreviated menagerie would drum up state money.
"We're hoping that someday . . . maybe we could get support from the state," said Moeslein, who strolled the lobby of the General Assembly Building with the rabbit and invited people to pet it.
Residents pushed for issues including more mental-health funding and looser motorcycle laws. Sometimes the advocates rubbed elbows in unexpected ways. One woman who had come to fight a proposed ban on private gun sales wound up posing for a photo with Moeslein's rabbit.
Whether they were advocating for conservative "family values" or gay rights and abortion access, there was agreement on one point: Lobby Day was the time to do it.
"I almost think if you aren't here," said Josh Horwitz, executive director for the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, "people will ask, 'Where are you?'ג[#x20ac][#x160]"
Strategies for buttonholing lawmakers varied. Horwitz said his members visited the offices of legislators friendly to their cause and those they thought could be persuaded.
"You always want to say hello to your friends, and then you go for the swings,'' he said.
James Van Bavel, a Yorktown psychiatrist and gun-rights activist, sought out lawmakers who opposed him on the issue.
"It's actually more fun to do, a little push-pull," he said. "It's exhilarating."
Van Bavel thought he'd made some headway with a legislative aide to Del. Jeion A. Ward (D-Hampton).
"We worked on him for about 20 minutes, and you could just see - click-click-click, the gears," Bavel said.
Jamaal Williams, the aide who met with Van Bavel, said the meeting did not produce a gun-rights epiphany. But he agreed that they had "a good dialogue."
"I was able to honestly see his side," Williams said.
On a day when the Capitol felt like a carnival, Van Bavel made an impression with his clothes. He sported an old-fashioned gray suit he'd bought for his sister's Victorian-themed wedding, complete with ascot, pocket watch and walking stick. He also wore a gun - not a period piece but a Walther PPS, which stands for "police pistol slim."
"I thought about bringing a revolver, but it's too bulky," he said.
Guns are permitted in the state Capitol and other government buildings in Virginia as long as the person packing heat has a concealed weapons permit or is a state lawmaker or law enforcement official. Guns cannot be brought into the Senate gallery, although they are allowed in the House gallery.
The loose gun policy did not make for an easy time at Capitol doorways, where metal detectors have been in place since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Capitol police directed gun-bearers to their own door so officers could check permits before the holders entered.
"There are always big crowds,'' said Del. Robert B. Bell (R-Charlottesville). "It's a holiday for most people, and it's an opportunity to come to visit. This is always one of our biggest days."
In the House gallery, people from the conservative Family Foundation, which opposes abortion and promotes school choice, mixed with college students seeking lower tuition and members of the NAACP.
Del. Betsy Carr (D-Richmond) said she enjoyed the day, even though she found her office inundated by motorcycle owners opposed to police checkpoints that target them.
"It's our government - people are making their statements, expressing themselves," Carr said. "That's the way it works."

As "Justified" returns, the troubled (but hot!) Deputy U.S. Marshal Raylan Givens (Timothy Olyphant) is still in pain from a gunshot wound he got in last season's bloody shootout with the drug-running Bennett clan. We find Raylan back at the firing range, glowering as he watches his shots go wildly askew.
It's a telling moment, because as "Justified" enters its third season Tuesday night on FX, the acclaimed series seems dangerously close to missing its mark. "You want this to get ugly?" a drug kingpin growls early on. "It can." 
For those unfamiliar with the show, "Justified" follows Olyphant's lawman, whose itchy trigger finger got him reassigned from Miami to the hills of his native eastern Kentucky. It's based on an Elmore Leonard novella called "Fire in the Hole," and the prolific crime author serves as executive producer.
Although beloved by critics and fans since its 2010 debut, "Justified" made good on its promise only well into its riveting second season, as Raylan found himself reluctantly re-immersed in the simmering blood feuds between his family and other clans in Harlan County - something he had long ago tried to escape. The season's standout performance by Margo Martindale, who played the Bennett clan's matriarch, Mags, with sap-tinged malice, won her a much-deserved Emmy. 
But Mags is gone after downing a poisoned gulp of her own homemade moonshine, as are two of her three loutish sons. That leaves much of the drug trade in Harlan County up for grabs and a big, fat script vacuum to go with it. 
As a fan of the first two seasons, I was curious about what Leonard and the show's creator, Graham Yost, have in store. I thought it might be difficult to top the Bennett saga, and after watching the first four episodes of this new season, I fear that assessment might be right.
"Justified" has been at its best when Raylan gets out of what's meant to be Lexington- it's actually filmed in Santa Clarita, Calif. - and up into the "pretty green trees and cut-off mountains" of Harlan County. That's Raylan's description of the place where he grew up, played football and dug coal. In the past, the writers have populated the hollers with folks like the Bennetts, who seem to have sprung up as organically as bluegrass. 
As the third season opens, Raylan is stuck at a desk job, struggling to heal, although he won't stay there for long. The papers he's pushing might as well be the first few episodes' scripts, filled as they are with plots and characters standard to almost any broadcast crime drama. There are Mexican narco thugs, a Mafia foot soldier hiding in the witness protection program and a new crime boss from Detroit ("Band of Brothers" actor Neal McDonough, with his usual blue-eyed intensity), who comes to Kentucky to start an Oxycontin syndicate.
Worse yet, along comes Karen Goodall (Carla Gugino), a high-ranking U.S. Marshals official from Washington and one of Raylan's former conquests. Gugino looks and acts like she arrived in Kentucky directly from the set of "Entourage," on which she played a Hollywood studio executive to much better effect. It's true that Gugino is incandescently beautiful, and it's nice to have an age-appropriate foil for Olyphant, who is in his 40s. But seeing her wield a semiautomatic pistol while wearing taupe platform heels, breasts a-jiggle, makes me cringe.
When the show finds energy, it is with Boyd Crowder (Walton Goggins), Raylan's perpetual nemesis - a white supremacist turned born-again Christian turned crime boss.
The two are perennially engaged in a cat-and-mouse game that neither seems obliged to win - Raylan shoots Boyd in the heart but just misses; Boyd saves Raylan's life when it would have been easier to let him die. Indeed, the show could be seen as an extended buddy story, a bromance of sorts. Boyd gets under Raylan's skin worse than his own kin, like his no-account daddy (Raymond J. Barry) or his ex-wife and current love, Winona (Natalie Zea). 
"At any point when you were looking at that gun thug," Boyd needled Raylan after the ill-advised Miami shooting that forced him home, "did you see your daddy's face?" 
The show begins to rouse from its torpor when Boyd sets about taking control of Harlan County's criminal trade and launches a hunt for missing money Mags left behind. Her surviving son, Dickie (Jeremy Davies), gets swept up in a prison break and wants the money, too. With Raylan again in pursuit, the show has nowhere to go but up.
Despite the wobbly start, there's no cause to give "Justified" a thumbs down - fans will still like it and, historically, the writing has been too darn good. And "Justified" has the potential to do for the hollers of Harlan County what "The Wire" did for the streets of Baltimore.
Newcomers should lay hands on Seasons 1 and 2 to get a feel for "Justified's" arresting blend of shoot-'em-up mayhem and Southern Gothic charm. Last season's finale - when the rival clans sat down for a "parley" summit in a church even as the hills exploded in violence - is as fine a bit of writing as you will see on television. 
As for this season, we'll see where it goes. Right now, the hype ain't justified.

Climate and the culture war

BYLINE: Michael Gerson

SECTION: EDITORIAL COPY; Pg. A13

LENGTH: 797 words

The attempt by Newt Gingrich to cover his tracks on climate change has been one of the shabbier little episodes of the 2012 presidential campaign. His forthcoming sequel to "A Contract with the Earth" was to feature a chapter by Katharine Hayhoe, a young professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas Tech University. Hayhoe is a scientist, an evangelical Christian and a moderate voice warning of climate disruption. 
Then conservative media got wind. Rush Limbaugh dismissed Hayhoe as a "climate babe." An Iowa voter pressed Gingrich on the topic. "That's not going to be in the book," he responded. "We told them to kill it." Hayhoe learned this news just as she was passing under the bus.  
A theory about the role of carbon dioxide in climate patterns has joined abortion and gay marriage as a culture war controversy. Climate scientists are attacked as greenshirts and watermelons (green on the outside, red on the inside). Skeptics are derided as flat-earthers. Reputations are assaulted and the e-mails of scientists hacked. 
A few years ago, the intensity of this argument would have been difficult to predict. In 2005, then-Gov. Mitt Romneyjoined a regional agreement to limit carbon emissions. In 2007, Gingrich publicly endorsed a cap-and-trade system for carbon. 
What explains the recent, bench-clearing climate brawl? A scientific debate has been sucked into a broader national argument about the role of government. Many political liberals have seized on climate disruption as an excuse for policies they supported long before climate science became compelling - greater federal regulation and mandated lifestyle changes. Conservatives have also tended to equate climate science with liberal policies and therefore reject both. 
The result is a contest of questioned motives. In the conservative view, the real liberal goal is to undermine free markets and national sovereignty (through international environmental agreements). In the liberal view, the real conservative goal is to conduct a war on science and defend fossil fuel interests. On the margin of each movement, the critique is accurate, supplying partisans with plenty of ammunition. 
No cause has been more effectively sabotaged by its political advocates. Climate scientists, in my experience, are generally careful, well-intentioned and confused to be at the center of a global controversy. Investigations of hacked e-mails have revealed evidence of frustration - and perhaps of fudging but not of fraud. It is their political defenders who often discredit their work through hyperbole and arrogance. As environmental writer Michael Shellenberger points out, "The rise in the number of Americans telling pollsters that news of global warming was being exaggerated began virtually concurrently with the release of Al Gore's movie, 'An Inconvenient Truth.'" 
The resistance of many conservatives to arguments about climate disruption is magnified by class and religion. Tea Party types are predisposed to question self-important elites. Evangelicals have long been suspicious of secular science, which has traditionally been suspicious of religious influence. Among some groups, skepticism about global warming has become a symbol of social identity - the cultural equivalent of a gun rack or an ichthus. 
But however interesting this sociology may be, it has nothing to do with the science at issue. Even if all environmentalists were socialists and secularists and insufferable and partisan to the core, it would not alter the reality of the Earth's temperature. 
Since the 1950s, global temperatures have increased about nine-tenths of a degree Celsius - the recent conclusion of the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature Project - which coincides with a large increase in greenhouse gasses produced by humans. This explanation is most consistent with the location of warming in the atmosphere. It best accounts for changing crop zones, declining species, thinning sea ice and rising sea levels. Scientists are not certain about the pace of future warming - estimates range from 2 degrees C to 5 degrees C over the next century. But warming is already proceeding faster than many plants and animals can adapt to. 
These facts do not dictate a specific political response. With Japan, Canada and Russia withdrawing from the Kyoto process, the construction of a global regulatory regime for carbon emissions seems unlikely and may have never been possible. The broader use of nuclear power, the preservation of carbon-consuming rain forests and the encouragement of new energy technologies are more promising. 
But any rational approach requires some distance between science and ideology. The extraction and burning of dead plant matter is not a moral good - or the proper cause for a culture war.

U.S. and Pakistan try to define 'a new normal'

BYLINE: Karen DeYoung;Karin Brulliard

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A01

LENGTH: 1378 words

In a call to her Pakistani counterpart this month, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton reiterated the Obama administration's counterterrorism "red line": The United States reserved the right to attack anyone who it determined posed a direct threat to U.S. national security, anywhere in the world.
Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar responded in kind, telling Clinton that Pakistan's red line was the violation of its sovereignty. Any unauthorized flight into its airspace, Khar bluntly told Clinton, risked being shot down.
The conversation, recounted by U.S. officials, was one of the few high-level exchanges between the two governments in recent months, and it illustrated the depths to which U.S.-Pakistan relations have fallen after an inadvertent November border clashin which a U.S. air assault killed 24 Pakistani soldiers. 
Since then, Pakistan's border crossings have remained closed to U.S. and NATO supplies in transit to the Afghan war. At Pakistan's demand, U.S. personnel have evacuated a secret drone airstrip, and the number of American military trainers in the country has been cut to a fraction of previous levels.
Marc Grossman,the administration's top diplomatin charge of Afghanistan and Pakistan, asked to visit Islamabad during a current trip to the region, but Pakistani officials responded that it was not convenient.
The "fundamentals" of mutual interest in destroying al-Qaeda and safely managing Pakistan's nuclear arsenal haven't changed, said a senior Obama administration official, who, like several sources in this article, discussed sensitive diplomatic matters on the condition of anonymity. But the two countries are groping their way toward what he called "a new normal" - somewhere between the strategic alliance that President Obama once proffered in exchange for Pakistan severing its ties with militants, and a more businesslike arrangement with few illusions.
"It'll be much more realpolitik," another U.S. official said. "It's getting away from the grandiose vision of what could be to focusing on what is."
A senior Pakistani military official said, "We've had some glorious times," citing past interludes of intelligence and military cooperation in pursuit of Pakistan-based al-Qaeda and Taliban militants.
But the military official also spoke emotionally about the deaths of the 24 soldiers in November and said the incident would not soon be forgotten. The same was true of what he said were other insults in 2011, including the shooting deaths of two Pakistanis by a CIA contractor in Lahore, the U.S. Special Operations raid that killed Osama bin Ladenin a Pakistani suburb and the assertion by Adm. Mike Mullen, then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, that the insurgent Haqqani network was a "veritable arm" of Pakistani intelligence.
Pakistan, the military official said, wants some "significant changes" in the way the two countries do business.
After the November border clash, the Obama administration suspended its regular drone attacks inside Pakistan to avoid further unsettling relations, U.S. officials said. And in a rare display of deference early this month, the CIA informed the Pakistani government that it planned a drone strike against a terrorist target in the North Waziristan tribal region and asked Islamabad's permission. When Pakistan declined, the strike was canceled, officials said.
But on Jan. 10, barely a week later, the 55-day drone hiatus ended abruptly with a strike that killed four alleged militants in North Waziristan, followed by another strike two days afterward. Although officials said Pakistan was notified in advance, permission was not sought.

Reviewing cooperation
A Pakistani parliamentary committee, with input from feuding military and civilian political factions, is conducting what Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani on Saturday called "a full review of the terms of cooperation" with the United States and the U.S.-led international coalition in Afghanistan.
"Pakistan's sovereignty and territorial integrity are not negotiable," Gilani said.
A senior Pakistani government official said the committee's recommendations will probably include a demand for explicit U.S. assurances that there will be no violation of sovereignty - no American boots on the ground, no more unilateral raids, no manned airstrikes. The official said there is likely to be some arrangement on drone attacks, with Pakistan calling for large reductions in their number and geographic scope, and demanding prior notification and approval of every strike.
Any explicit agreement on drones would be a major change from past practice, in which Pakistan has privately agreed to strikes but publicly denounced them.
Pakistan also wants more explicit compensation for U.S. and NATO supplies transiting its ports and roads, perhaps in the form of taxes. And it wants more comprehensive information about CIA operations and personnel. "There are over 1,000 houses in Pakistan that have been hired by the U.S. Embassy, and we don't know who lives in them," the Pakistani official said.
Yet in a recent parliamentary briefing, Finance Minister Abdul Hafiz Sheikh cautioned against a complete breakdown of U.S. ties, saying the nation's economy could not absorb the shock, according to a second Pakistani official.
In addition to receiving nearly $3 billion in annual military and civilian assistance - much of which has been withheld by the Obama administration over the past year of conflict - Pakistan is well aware of the U.S. influence in international financial institutions and other important world forums.
U.S. peace talks with the Talibanare also a top issue for Pakistan, which has provided sanctuary for the Haqqani network, a Taliban ally, as well as the main Taliban leadership as leverage to protect its long-term interests in Afghanistan. Although the Obama administration and the Afghan government have offered the Pakistanis a role in the peace talks, both mistrust their motives.

Role in the Afghan war
In the United States, Obama is under political pressure to show Islamabad who is the global boss. Patience here has grown paper-thin with what is seen as Pakistani double-dealing and intransigence that is getting in the way of efforts to wind down the Afghan war.
An emerging U.S. military narrative, in preparation for internal administration discussions over the pace of troop withdrawal, holds that the U.S.-led coalition cannot quickly consolidate its considerable gains in Afghanistan because of Pakistan. A heavy U.S. footprint needs to be maintained, a senior Pentagon official said, because Pakistan refuses to crack down on the Haqqani network, whose forces regularly attack coalition troops in Afghan border provinces.
Pakistan also has snubbed U.S. efforts to boost the Afghan economy with a gas pipeline that would run from Turkmenistan through Afghanistan to Pakistani ports. Instead, it has reiterated its plans to proceed with an alternative pipeline from Iran.
Obama administration officials said they will resist responding until Pakistan's Parliament has finished its review of relations with the United States. "We have views on where we'd like to see this go," a U.S. official said. But it will "take another week or two . . . for their internal process to come to some kind of formal communication that would be communicated back to us."
U.S. officials question whether Pakistan has the ability or the desire to shoot down U.S. aircraft, whether armed drones; unarmed, unmanned planes that regularly conduct surveillance over border areas; or manned attack and military transport planes that sometimes stray unintentionally over the border.
They said there have been at least two accidental violations of Pakistani airspace in recent weeks by piloted aircraft in Afghanistan, but both incidents were calmly defused by border coordination centers on the Afghan side.

Man is arrestedin home invasions
A Fort Washington man was arrested in North Carolina on Saturday in connection with three home invasion robberies and two sexual assaults in Montgomery and Prince George's counties this month, police said.
Police said they arrested Kevin Darnell Ray, 33, in Kitty Hawk N.C., and charged him with armed robbery, first- and third-degree sexual offenses, first-degree assault and other charges.
He has been brought to Maryland and is being held without bond. A bond hearing is scheduled for Tuesday. 
Police said the home invasions occurred in Wheaton on Jan. 10, in Bethesda on Jan. 11 and in Temple Hills on Jan. 13.
 Police allege that in the Bethesda incident, Ray tied up three occupants of the home, sexually assaulted a housekeeper and stole a car and a credit card.
In the Temple Hills incident, police say Ray followed a woman into her house, showed a gun, tied up the occupants of the house, sexually assaulted the woman and took several items.

Proposal aims to bridge health gap
Maryland is one of the nation's most affluent states but continues to suffer high rates of infant death, sexually transmitted diseases and kidney disease among minority populations. In a proposal to be unveiled Tuesday, Lt. Gov. Anthony G. Brown (D) will outline a series of financial incentives that he says could help narrow the health-care gap in the state.
Brown's recommendations, aimed at expanding primary care and improving the overall health of residents, are based on a study by the Maryland Health Quality and Cost Council Disparities Workgroup, headed by the dean of the University of Maryland School of Medicine, E. Albert Reece.
"Maryland has world-class hospitals, top medical schools and one of the highest rates of primary-care physicians per capita, and yet we continue to see disparities in health care and outcomes among Maryland's racial and ethnic communities," Brown said.
The group recommended creation of health-care zones where tax breaks and other incentives would be available to providers who set up shop; a Maryland Health Innovation Prize, a financial reward and public recognition for an individual, group, organization or coalition that reduces health-care disparities; and closer tracking of racial and ethnic data in programs that already reward hospitals for improving overall care.

VIRGINIA

Marshall announces run for U.S. Senate
Del. Robert G. Marshall, a Prince William County Republican and one of the most conservative voices in the House of Delegates, announced Monday that he will run for U.S. Senate this year.
In his announcement, Marshall ignored the crowded GOP field, including former senator George Allen, and went after the presumed Democratic nominee, former governor Timothy M. Kaine.
"I already have a 'can do' record of challenging Tim Kaine and winning in the public arena on major economic and social issues, and I can do it again,'' Marshall said in a statement.
Supporters began circulating petitions last week to place his name on the June 12 primary ballot in the race to replace Sen. James Webb (D), who is retiring.
Marshall, 57, said he was urged to get in the race while he campaigned in the fall for reelection to the House, where he has served since 1992.
Marshall wrote the marriage amendment to the Virginia Constitution that was ratified in 2006; the Virginia Health Care Freedom Act of 2010, the basis of the state's court challenge of the federal health-care law; and successfully challenged the constitutionality of a 2007 transportation bill that would have let unelected authorities impose taxes.

Driver is chargedin death of boy
A Fairfax County man has been charged with manslaughter and several other counts after his car swerved off of Duke Street and hit a woman and her 8-year-old son, killing the boy, police said.
Alexandria police said Victor M. Aldana, 22, of the Alexandria section of Fairfax County was driving west on Duke near Interstate 395 when he ran off the road and struck the two pedestrians. The boy, identified Monday as Brian Hernandez-Chavez, was pronounced dead at the scene.
Aldana was charged with manslaughter while driving under the influence, maiming (under the influence), reckless driving and operating a vehicle without a license, police said. He is being held without bond at the Alexandria jail.

Suspect in 3 home invasions is held without bond

BYLINE: Katherine Driessen

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B03

LENGTH: 518 words

After sexually assaulting a housekeeper in a home invasion robbery in Montgomery County, a registered sex offender forced his victim to stand under a shower to wash away DNA evidence, prosecutors said in court Tuesday. 
The disturbing detail was among several Montgomery County prosecutors described as they outlined charges against Kevin Ray, 33, of Fort Washington, who is a suspect in two January home invasions in Montgomery. Prosecutors called Ray, who is also accused in a Prince George's County home invasion this month, a dangerous criminal whose convictions include involuntary manslaughter, robbery and a sex offense.
http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/home-invasion-suspect-arrested-in-north-carolina/2012/01/14/gIQAkHwOzP_story.htmlRay, who was arrested Saturday in North Carolina, appeared at the hearing via closed-circuit television. He answered a judge's questions but did not address the charges and was held without bond.
In Wheaton, the robber targeted a woman carrying a baby. And in Bethesda, a 14-year-old was in the house.
"There were . . .  threats to kill not only the women involved in these cases, but the children," Montgomery State's Attorney John McCarthy said after the hearing. "It was by design that these [the crimes] occurred in occupied homes."
In the Wheaton case, a woman carrying her baby left her garage door open while she delivered a pie to a neighbor Jan. 10, prosecutors said. She returned to find a man in a ski mask in the garage.
The man demanded her money, debit card and car keys, prosecutors said. He tried to force her to drive him to an automated teller machine. She refused, and he locked her and the child in a garage closet and fled in the vehicle.
The next day in Bethesda, prosecutors said, a housekeeper encountered a man who forced her into the house at gunpoint. Inside, he confronted the homeowner and her 14-year-old son.
Prosecutors said the robber threatened to kill the woman and teenager, and ordered the boy to tie up his mother. He then tied up the housekeeper and the teenager, and sexually assaulted the housekeeper, prosecutors said.
Prince George's police obtained a warrant charging Ray in a Jan. 13 home invasion in Temple Hills. Ray is accused of sexually assaulting a woman after forcing his way into her home at gunpoint.
Montgomery prosecutors said Ray told police that he had committed robberies in the D.C. area with the aid of another man. After that man was killed in a recent robbery, prosecutors said, Ray went on a home invasion spree.
In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Ray was involved in similar attacks in Prince George's County. In 2002, Ray broke into a Clinton home, sexually assaulted a woman and robbed her daughter at gunpoint, court records show. He pleaded guilty to third-degree sex offense and was sentenced to 7 1 / 2 years in prison.
Ray was also convicted of breaking into a Fort Washington home and robbing two people in 1998 and in the fatal shooting of Theodore K. Newby, 19, after a fight at a party in Clinton in 1995, court records show.

Afghan gunman acted alone

BYLINE: Craig Whitlock

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A10

LENGTH: 996 words

The attack erupted in one of the best-protected parts of Afghanistan: the military-controlled portion of the Kabul airport. As two dozen people gathered for a routine morning meeting in a conference room, an overweight and aging Afghan helicopter pilot pulled a pistol out of his flight suit and began shooting U.S. Air Force officers in the backs of their heads.
On Tuesday, after an intensive eight-month investigation, the U.S. Air Force concluded that the shooter, Col. Ahmed Gul, 46, had acted alone in killing eight members of the U.S.  Air Force and one American contractor before killing himself. The probe found no evidence that the attack was part of a Taliban conspiracy. 
But the 436-page reportby the Air Force Office of Special Investigations also found that Gul had become increasingly radicalized in recent years, had attended an extremist mosque in Pakistan and told relatives that he wanted to "kill Americans." Some Afghan military leaders told U.S. investigators that they were alarmed by his changed views and attitude, yet there was no sign that they did anything to intervene.
The April 27 rampage was the deadliest attack on U.S. Air Force personnel since 1996, when a truck bomb blew up the Khobar Towers housing complex in Saudi Arabia, killing 19 U.S service members.
Most of those who died in the Kabul attack were assigned to training the fledgling Afghan Air Force, and their deaths fanned fears that insurgents had once again infiltrated the ranks of the Afghan military.
The incident underscored the risks and fragility of the Obama administration's strategy to train and expand Afghan security forces loyal to President Hamid Karzai so they can fill the void left by departing U.S. and NATO troops. While Afghan officials are supposed to screen recruits and have beefed up counterintelligence programs to detect Taliban sympathizers, acts of betrayal have undermined trust between Afghan forces and their coalition trainers.
Although two Afghan service members were shot and three others injured in the Kabul melee, the Air Force investigation makes it clear that Gul singled out U.S. officers who had mentored their Afghan colleagues and shouted warnings to his countrymen to save themselves. No Afghans died in the attack.
"Good Muslims - please stay away!" Gul shouted from a window of the Air Command and Control Center at the Kabul Airport as Afghan security forces rushed to the scene of the gunshots. "Muslims, don't come close or you will be killed!"
Gul paused at one point during the shooting and dipped his fingers in blood, the investigation found. Along a hallway, he scrawled "Allah is one" on a wall in Dari, a Persian dialect widely spoken in Afghanistan. On the opposite wall, he painted the words, "Allah in your name."
He then walked up a flight of stairs, sat on a couch and fatally shot himself in the chest.
Investigators said that Gul killed seven U.S. Air Force officers: Maj. Philip D. Ambard,  Maj. Jeffrey O. Ausborn, Maj. David L. Brodeur, Lt. Col. Frank D. Bryant Jr., Maj. Raymond G. Estelle II, Capt. Nathan J. Nylander and Maj. Charles A. Ransom.
Also killed were a non-commissioned officer, Master Sgt. Tara R. Brown, and a private contractor, James McLaughlin Jr., a retired Army lieutenant colonel.
The Americans were armed, but few returned fire, the investigation found. The report said that they had been taken completely by surprise.
In the days after the shooting, U.S. and Afghan officials said that Gul had financial problems,  but they struggled to find a motive.
Gul's brother Hassan Sahibi, a surgeon, also was at a loss. "He never hated foreigners," Sahibitold The Washington Post in April. "He always served his country."
U.S. Air Force investigators later uncovered disturbing hints about Gul's loyalties and state of mind.
One of Gul's relatives, who was not identified in the redacted report, told investigators that the pilot loved to drink and party when he joined the Afghan Air Force in the early 1980s. But when the Taliban took power a decade later, he became increasingly religious, grew a beard and became a mosque regular.
In 2006, saying he was upset because "foreigners had invaded his country," Gul moved to Hayatabad, Pakistan, just outside the frontier city of Peshawar, where he lived in housing provided by the Pakistani military, according to the relative.
After 18 months, he returned to Kabul to rejoin the Afghan Air Force. When family members asked him why he was going back, he replied that he wanted "to kill Americans," according to the relative interviewed by U.S. investigators. The relative said no one in the family took Gul seriously.
In Kabul, Gul was assigned to manage passenger and cargo operations for the Afghan Air Force, but he rarely showed up for work on time and displayed a sour personality, colleagues told U.S. investigators.
An Afghan Air Force colonel who had known Gul for more than 20 years described him as "irresponsible, stubborn and insistent." He said Gul had become much more religious, attended a mosque headed by an anti-American imam and that his "views were boiling over and extreme to an extent."
The unidentified Afghan colonel also said he was surprised that Gul was quickly issued a 9mm pistol just four months after reporting for duty in Kabul, which was "not normal." The colonel speculated that Gul must have had "top cover" from a high-ranking officer in the Ministry of Defense, although he did not specify anyone, according to the report.
Although U.S. and Afghan investigators found no evidence that Gul had a direct connection to the Taliban, his suicide mission did not lack for public sympathy.
According to the investigation and news reports, about 1,500 Afghans turned out for his funeral. Many praised him as a martyr.

Over the next few months, the Washington Capitals will have to answer a tough question about Mike Green's future: re-sign the No. 1 defenseman in the hopes he can stay healthy, or go in another direction?
When Green is 100 percent, he's rushing the puck end to end, making precise outlet passes, scoring on the power play and igniting capacity crowds at Verizon Center.  
But the two-time Norris Trophy finalist can only have an impact on a game when he's in it. And over the past two seasons, that's been all too rare.
On Monday afternoon, the Capitals announced that Green's latest ailment - a right groin muscle injury - would require surgery, which was performed  Tuesday in St. Louis. He's expected to be sidelined four to six weeks. 
Going under the knife was the last resort. But it had become obvious after his setback in San Jose that rehabbing just wasn't working. By having the tear surgically repaired, the timeline for his recovery becomes more certain.
If all goes according to plan, Green would be on skates in a few weeks. Shooting pucks soon after that. And back in the lineup late next month - just ahead of the Feb. 27 trade deadline. 
That means General Manager George McPhee would be afforded just enough time to evaluate Green's recovery before deciding whether or not the team needs to acquire a defenseman for the stretch run and playoffs. Last season, McPhee traded for Dennis Wideman because of injuries to Green and Tom Poti. A similar move might be necessary this season, too.
But that's a short-term concern. A much more significant one, with longer lasting implications, looms this summer.
Green needs a new contract. He's set to become a restricted free agent on July 1 and currently is the team's fourth highest-paid player behind Alex Ovechkin, Nicklas Backstrom and Alexander Semin with a cap hit of $5.25 million. 
To retain his rights, the Capitals must tender a qualifying offer of $5 million, a steep price considering Green has been sidelined for all but 10 of the Capitals' 43 games this season and 60 of the team's past 72 regular season games. Green and his camp probably will seek a long-term deal, pointing to his 70-plus point seasons in 2008-09 and 2009-10 and his upside. A stretch of strong play when he returns would help their case.
McPhee could also attempt to trade Green, but that market figures to be tepid, at best, considering the 26-year-old's checkered medical history.
Any way you look at the situation, it figures to be a difficult choice for McPhee.
On the one hand, there's no doubting what Green means to this franchise. After all, this is "Game Over Green" we're talking about here, the "One-Man Breakout," "Lambogreenie," a founding member of the Young Guns, a fan favorite whose No. 52 jersey dots the sea of red on F Street. He was here when the team stunk. He was vital in its return to relevance. And, if healthy, he could be a critical component in coming seasons - "if" and "could" being the operative words.
On the other hand, McPhee has spent the better part of 24 months figuring out how to keep his team competitive minus one of its most important pieces. 
To review: Green has been sidelined with shoulder, knee, hip flexor, ankle and groin muscle maladies. Along the way, there have also been two concussions, which, according to some around the NHL, are more concerning than all the others combined.
Complicating matters is the team's recent surge with Green rocking a stylish pinstriped suit rather than a red, white and blue uniform. They're 9-1 with him on the ice this season. But there's also growing evidence that the Capitals have learned to cope in his absence. They briefly returned to the top of the Southeast Division standings this week and now sit a mere point behind Florida, a smidge out of third place in the Eastern Conference.
Which brings us back to McPhee's quandary.
In the end, it's likely going to come down to whether McPhee and his medical staff believe Green has been the victim of bad luck, or whether the injuries are symptomatic of deeper problems.
If they determine it's misfortune, then they ought to keep him and cross their fingers and hope he returns to his all-star form. But if they decide the injuries are the result of Green constantly putting himself in vulnerable positions, or that his body simply can't withstand the rigors of the NHL, it might be time to move on.

Syrian protesters hail monitors during visit

DATELINE: KESWA, SYRIA

KESWA, Syria -  Anti-regime protesters in the Damascus suburbs gavean Arab League peace observers' mission an ecstatic welcome Tuesday, but warned that President Bashar al-Assad's security forces would attack as soon as they left.
After monitors passed the sandbag-protected police post at the entrance to the main street of the Keswa district, people approached them first in a trickle and then a flood, desperate to tell their stories of family members arrested and killed. 
Some of the women were in tears, while a man brandished a phone with a picture of a bloodied corpse he said was his son. Another man warned: "When you go from here, Bashar al-Assad's terrorists will come here and kill us, just remember this!"
The outpouring underscored both the importance and the limitations of the much-criticized observers, on a day when a rebel army chief called for international military intervention to replace a mission he said had failed to halt a bloody crackdown by regime forces, and the U.N. Security Council members were preparing to debate a draft Syria resolution drawn up by Russia - one of Assad's main international allies.
Violence flared anew Tuesday across the country. According to the Associated Press, the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 18 people were killed in Syria on Tuesday, most by troops or pro-government gunmen. The Local Coordination Committees, another activist group, said 32 people were killed, 19 of them in the restive central province of Homs.
The discrepancy could not be resolved.
"Unfortunately we're continuing to see unacceptable levels of violence inside that country," President Obama said in Washington after meeting with Jordan's King Abdullah II.
"We will continue to consult very closely with Jordan to create the kind of international pressure and environment that encourages the current Syrian regime to step aside," he said. 
The observers arrived in Keswa - a protest hot spot outside Damascus - to a near-silence that was broken by one man's shout of "The people want to hang the president!" as the convoy passed.
Once the observers halted, residents emerged, and the monitors were mobbed and left struggling to write down the stories they were being told, fragments of the 10-month uprising that has left an estimated 5,000 people dead. 
This brief protest was the first demonstration in more than a week in Keswa, residents said, after a crackdown by the security forces made people too afraid to come out. "If there is a demonstration, it will be immediately shot at," one man said.
People seemed genuinely grateful for the mission's presence, using phone cameras to film the monitors' orange jackets. Two of the observers were even lifted shoulder-high like sports heroes.
For all the elation, the demonstrators were aware how temporary their feeling of security was likely to be and pointed to security force members at the end of the road and in a nearby building.    
The monitors' 165-person team, whose future will be debated by Arab League foreign ministers Sunday, is seen as too small to cover all the potential flashpoints in a country the size of Syria. According to one observer interviewed by the Financial Times at another location, the protocol governing their relations with the Syrian government does not allow them to do their job properly.
"By the time we've got through the red tape, half the security forces know where we're going," the monitor said. "Within the current protocol we can't change anything."
Not long after the observers left Keswa, quiet descended once more, and a man began blotting out the freshly-painted graffiti on a street where, an hour earlier, a man with a scarf over his face to protect his identity had muttered that he wanted NATO intervention in his troubled country.
He and his fellow protesters had disappeared to face their fears of the reaction of a regime that the international monitors seem to have had little success in holding in check.
"Today when you go, I don't know if I will still be alive," said the man, who predicted the security forces would come in after the monitors left. "I don't care, I don't care."

White House shooting suspect indicted

BYLINE: Paul Duggan

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B05

LENGTH: 269 words

A federal grand jury issued a 17-count indictment Tuesday against accused White House shooter Oscar Ramiro Ortega-Hernandez, charging him with attempted assassination of the president and an array of other crimes. 
Ortega-Hernandez, 21, who has described himself as the second coming of Jesus, allegedly fired about a dozen shots at the White House the night of Nov. 11 after driving to Washington from his home in Idaho Falls, Idaho.
He had told acquaintances that he considered President Obama to be "the devil," the FBI said.
The shots were fired at the executive mansion with a semiautomatic rifle from about 750 yards away, and at least two rounds hit the exterior of the residential floors on the building's south side, the FBI said.
Even though Obama and his wife were in San Diego at the time of the incident, the grand jury indicted Ortega-Hernandez on a charge of attempted assassination, punishable by up to life in prison upon conviction.
Ortega-Hernandez has been locked up without bail since being arrested five days after the shooting.
The grand jury, in U.S. District Court in Washington, also charged him with three counts each of assaulting a federal officer, assault with a dangerous weapon and possessing a gun during a violent crime. Those counts relate to three members of the Secret Service who were in the line of fire on the White House grounds the night of Nov. 11, authorities said.
Ortega-Hernandez also was indicted on five counts of using a firearm during a violent crime, one count of illegally transporting a gun across state lines and one count of damaging federal property.

How much respect for an enemy

SECTION: EDITORIAL COPY; Pg. A14

LENGTH: 599 words

Regarding Sebastian Junger's Jan. 15 Outlook commentary, "In war, we all desecrate the enemy":
As a Marine who went to Vietnam when I was 20 and served 13 months, I read with sadness and understanding about my fellow Marines who apparently urinated on the corpses of their enemy. There is nothing glorious, chivalrous or romantic about combat. These four American volunteers did what they'd been trained to do: Kill their enemy and survive. How they chose to express their relief at cheating death is an unfortunate but understandable reaction to defeating a contemptible enemy who moments before was trying to end their young lives.
However, the broader shame and sadness is prompted by the behavior of our government, which has long seen our military as a blunt-force tool of specious foreign policy and has been only too willing to send its young citizens into incomprehensible life-and-death situations. 
Ronald A. Stup,Highland
l
Achilles's dragging of Hector's body behind his chariot is forever remembered not as a natural or understandable consequence of warfare but rather as a grave breach of the code among warriors: that even though they may seek to bring about another's death, they are expected to afford their vanquished foe the same respect they would want for themselves or their comrades, regardless of personal loss suffered in the fighting. 
Sebastian Junger's argument that such conduct is the result of the civilian government's policies is unpersuasive. The fact is, soldiers on the battlefield have always been held to a higher standard than their civilian overseers. Treachery has long been a tactic left by soldiers to the politicians. 
Should the Marines who were videotaped apparently urinating on the bodies of their enemies ever face a court-martial, their defense counsel should look for alternatives to Mr. Junger's argument: "You ordered them to kill, so why shouldn't they be expected to desecrate the bodies?" The retort will be simple: In the profession of arms, a measure of dignity is expected, if not for one's enemy, then for oneself. And it is anarchy, not warfare, that causes atrocities.
David O. Anglin, Bowie
The writer, a lieutenant colonel, is a member of the Army's Judge Advocate General's Corps.
l
As his book "War" did, Sebastian Junger's Outlook commentary can help civilians like me comprehend what combat veterans experience. Mr. Junger pointed to Achilles' human yet dehumanizing response to emotional tragedy. Art and literature are rife with anecdotes portraying similar dehumanizations.
Goya's "Charge of the Mamelukes" depicted the sweeping irrationalities battlefields contain. Twain offered a glimpse into mob mentality in his novel "Huckleberry Finn." Orwell's essay "Shooting an Elephant" shows how the pressures of group-think and self-preservation can force one into killing a foe who is no longer dangerous.
It is too easy to pass judgment on the unfortunate souls who get caught up in the heat of horrors we helped create and benefit from. Perhaps art and literature offer the civilian and veteran alike a place to comprehend inhumanity. Surely, once home, these war veterans who are accused of desecrating their enemies' bodies will need to understand their actions before they can forgive themselves. 
James Siegel, Montagnola, Switzerland
l
I share the sadness Sebastian Junger feels about the video of the Marines. Until we are willing to look past war as a means of settling our differences, we must be willing to understand and accept the consequences of asking our young men and women to kill and maim on our behalf. 
Frank DeGrace, Bowie

Robber used children to trick 84-year-old

BYLINE: Matt Zapotosky

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B05

LENGTH: 396 words

Prince George's County police are searching for a woman who used three young children in an elaborate ruse to rob an 84-year-old woman of several thousand dollars last week, authorities said Wednesday. 
The incident began about noon last Thursday in the parking lot of Murry's Steaks on New Hampshire Avenue, said Capt. Marc Alexander, an assistant commander in the county police's District 1 station. That is where the woman, along with two young boys and an infant, approached the 84-year-old to ask for help cashing a check, Alexander said.
Sympathetic to the children, the elderly woman agreed to drive the woman to the Bank of America just down the road while the children stayed behind with another woman, police said. But along the way, the woman's demeanor changed, Alexander said. She told the 84-year-old she had a gun, adding that the victim would be shot if she did not withdraw and hand over several thousand dollars.
"You try to help somebody, and then they turn around and mistreat you," the 84-year-old woman said at a police news conference Wednesday. "We're not stupid. We're not dumb. We just try to help people."
The 84-year-old, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because she and police fear those involved could find her, said the woman told her that the youths were her sister's children and that they had not eaten in days. The victim said the children's presence persuaded her to help.
"If the children wouldn't have been there, I would have never stopped," she said.
Alexander said that after she was threatened, the 84-year-old did as she was told, going into the bank with the suspect and withdrawing several thousand dollars to hand over. When that was done, he said, the 84-year-old drove the woman back to Murry's. The robber left on foot toward the District, and the 84-year-old eventually contacted police, Alexander said.
Alexander said police are still looking for the robber and the woman whom she left the children with before getting in the car.
Alexander said police are also exploring whether the incident might be connected to a similar one that occurred in the New Carrollton area months ago. In that case, he said, the suspect also targeted an elderly person to cash a check, but the suspect and victim were men. He said it was too early to say whether the two incidents might have been perpetrated by the same group.

Army to destroy chemical stockpile
The U.S. Army will have destroyed about 90 percent of its chemical weapons by week's end after an operation in Utah, site of its largest stockpile - a witches' brew of toxins, blister and blood agents that accumulated through the Cold War, officials said. 
The Army's Deseret Chemical Depot in Utah's west desert planned to burn its last weapons, which contain mustard agent, in a 2,000-degree furnace this week. 
The United States is party to a treaty intended to rid the world community of chemical weapons. The goal was to have been met by April 29 but will take years longer.

Guantanamo makes new rules on mail 
A  magazine published by an arm of al-Qaeda reached a terrorism suspect at the Guantanamo prison, leading to an inspection of cells and a contentious new policy requiring special teams to examine correspondence between prisoners and attorneys, U.S. prosecutors said Wednesday.
Navy Cmdr. Andrea Lockhart said at a pretrial hearing that a copy of Inspire magazine got to  a cell. She said the breach showed that rules governing mail review were inadequate. Al-Qaeda of the Arabian Peninsula launched the magazine in 2010. 
Lockhart is part of the U.S. team prosecuting Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, a Saudi charged with planning the attack on the USS Cole in 2000. Al-Nashiri, 47,  a senior al-Qaeda leader,  has been held at the U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay since 2006.

First challenger to governor emerges
A Democrat widely viewed as a union favorite emerged Wednesday to challenge Gov. Scott Walker, a day after activists said they submitted enough signatures to force a recall election.
Kathleen Falk was the first of several Democrats who are likely to challenge the Republican governor.  
Unions have been active in the recall campaign, which occurred after passage of a Walker proposal that effectively ended collective-bargaining rights for most public-sector workers.

Case against IMF head dropped because of uncertainty: The prosecutor who charged Dominique Strauss-Kahn with sexually assaulting a New York City hotel maid says he dropped the case because he wasn't convinced he knew beyond a reasonable doubt what had happened. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. said Wednesday that the issue was "not that something didn't happen" but whether prosecutors could meet the legal standard for proving it.     
Passenger brings gun onto airplane: Authorities say a 65-year-old woman was taken into custody Wednesday after carrying a gun onto an American Airlines aircraft at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. Security personnel had detected a handgun in the woman's carry-on bag, but she picked up the bag and left the area before the screening  was over, officials said.

A virtual tour of Calvert's history

BYLINE: Meghan Russell

SECTION: METRO; Pg. T17

LENGTH: 863 words

The Calvert Library Prince Frederickbranch premiered an abbreviated audiovisual tour of county history Jan. 10 with the first of this year's Local History Series programs.
The evening, co-sponsored by the Calvert County Historic District Commission, featured excerpts of recorded oral histories to introduce the packed house of more than 100 people to the library's recent project, a book titled "Changing Landscapes in Southern Maryland." But the feature presentation of the night was about 45 minutes of the commission's 100-minute video tour of the St. Leonard area of Calvert, illustrated with current and historic images and narrated by local voices with excerpts from oral history recordings. Some of the people recorded for the project have died, but they live on in the historical tour, which the commission has said it plans to use as a model for more historic county tours.
After seeing, for the first time, a sample of the finished product, created by Jeff Gruber of Blue House Productions, commission Chairman Linda Collins called it "absolutely incredible. I couldn't do that if you put a gun to my head; that took a lot of technical ingenuity. I don't think I've ever been more pleased. It's going to be a wonderful contribution to tourism." 
Gruber began working on the $14,000 grant-funded project about a year ago, but the idea originally came about three years ago, piggybacked on top of previous undertakings. The commission converted dozens of audio interviews with local residents recorded about 30 years ago and combined them with interviews that took place in 2003. The material had been used in the making of two books, known as "The Money Crop" books, that focus on the history of tobacco farming. Then the commission supplied historical maps and photographs of people and places for Gruber to piece together with the audio and music, using the U.S. National Park Service grant.
Eventually, all 16 sections, or car stops, will be available online, said Calvert County Historic Preservation planner Kirsti Uunila. Those interested in taking the tour can view it online or download it as a podcast and take it with them as they drive along the tour. The Web site for the tour will be publicized once it goes live in the spring.
The first tour, shown last week, takes its audience through the history of St. Leonard Creek, beginning with a narration about Capt. John Smith, early European explorers and the American Indian tribes living along Calvert's shores. Listeners are instructed to drive down Parran, Mackall and Broomes Island roads as they learn what life was like for the settlers, the history of tobacco farming, naval battles fought during the War of 1812, the steamboat industry and Mackall's Wharf, the first black and white churches and one-room schools, sharecropping and the eventual government tobacco buyout in the early 21st century.
All narration is done by local voices. Audio excerpts are from recorded interviews with former Calvert County Circuit Judge Perry Bowen Jr., former county commissioner Wilson Parran, Calvert resident and Maryland Secretary of Agriculture Earl "Buddy" Hance and Helen Gray - who shares her experiences working in the tobacco fields and growing up in a one-room schoolhouse for black children and "who is no longer with us," Uunila said, among others. Gray, who was in her 90s at the time of her interview, was close to 100 when she died, Uunila said.
"Remembering the past isn't just about the past. It's an activity in the present," Uunila said, "using the past to connect to the present."
Looking out the library window at the bustling Prince Frederick Town Center, she said, "There used to be a barn right over there. . . . Projects like these help us also to listen to, to hear the voices of people we know and people we may not have had the chance to know otherwise" as they walk listeners through the history of Calvert and how it's changed throughout the years with the decline of tobacco farming and the tremendous period of growth and development that occurred during the past several decades.
The first 20 people who arrived at the premiere event received a copy of "Changing Landscapes," a project developed during the past few years by the Southern Maryland Regional Library Association and StoryCorps, featuring transcribed oral recordings of tri-county residents. The association went through various local agencies and organizations to gather interviews and recordings they already had, said Victoria Falcon, public relations and marketing coordinator for the library association.
"It was amazing to me how many groups already have oral histories," Falcon said. "Many are just sitting on shelves."
Samples of audio excerpts used in the book are at www.mdch.org, Maryland Digital Cultural Heritage's Web site. All recordings also are available in the Library of Congress. The book never will be for sale because of contracts signed with StoryCorps and individuals who participated in the recordings, but it is available for loan at Southern Maryland libraries and free to download as a PDF or e-book. All Southern Maryland schools and public libraries in Maryland also received a copy.

The right's man?

BYLINE: Jason Horowitz

SECTION: STYLE; Pg. C01

LENGTH: 1917 words

DATELINE: IN COLUMBIA, S.C.

  In the seven presidential election cycles since Ronald Reagan won the 1980 Republican nomination, the party's base has lamented its failure to send another unadulterated conservative to the top of the ticket. Like a perpetual political bridesmaid, the right wing has swooned for ideological soulmates and bickered over potential suitors while establishment candidates such as Mitt Romneyhave gone on to seal the deal.
But in a deeper sense, those seemingly jilted conservatives do get their man.
Republican candidates have conformed to the needs of a vastly conservative primary electorate ever since the party rejected Romney's father, George, in 1968; his failed presidential campaign represented an early turning point in the decline of moderate Republicanism. Mitt Romney's contortions to fit the conservative mold make for a poignant coda to a precedent set by George H.W. Bush, Bob Dole, George W. Bush and John McCain before him. 
All of those eventual nominees, to varying but significant degrees, adopted the conservative ideology of their insurgent rivals while inheriting the palatable aura - or in Romney's case, the lantern jaw - of their moderate forebears. While a Romney nomination may vindicate the family name, it would also complete the conservative eclipse of his father's moderate vision.
History has compressed the elder Romney's campaign to his woeful explanation of why he was for the Vietnam War before he was against it (because of "brainwashing"by generals, he said). But at the time, his fiscal conservatism, self-made Midwestern values and emphasis on civil rights set him apart from the party's fading East Coast liberal wing, represented by New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller; the surging conservatism of Reagan; and the ideological flexibility of Richard Nixon. Among them, Romney stood as a standard-bearer of moderation in a party that had begun its long march to the right.
"George Romney was somebody who could have revived the moderate Republican fortunes within the party," said Geoffrey Kabaservice, a scholar who has studied the collapse of moderate Republicanism. "He might have made the party in his own image."
Instead, image alone has proved to be the strongest legacy of Republican moderates. The centrist diaspora, which has lost the ideological battles but still controls important real estate in the Wall Street and Washington quarters of the GOP establishment, prefers a candidate to whom it can relate. Its members doubt that conservative firebrands and Southern fundamentalists, for all their grass-roots appeal, can win general elections.
"If there is an establishment, we look at who can be elected," said Dole, the 1996 presidential nominee - who, it should be noted, handily lost the general election to Bill Clinton after overcoming protests on his right from Newt Gingrichand others. Today, he is supporting Mitt Romney. "My man is winning," he said.
The establishment's enduring belief that unmitigated conservatives cannot win the big one has its roots in the disastrous nomination of Barry Goldwaterin 1964. Not only did Goldwater's hostile takeover of the GOP convention lead to a rout by Lyndon Johnson, but Republicans suffered in all levels of government, down to local sheriff's races.
For the GOP grandees, the lesson was clear: Put forward a candidate whose platform resonated with the growing and increasingly conservative base, but whose connections and countenance put moderates at ease. According to Kabaservice, the author of "Rule and Ruin: The Downfall of Moderation and the Destruction of the Republican Party," Reagan himself moderated his conservative rhetoric - and his style of governing - in the years following Goldwater's defeat.
But after Barack Obama's 2008 victory, which many conservatives consider an existential threat to their view of America, the current crop of long-shot candidates is arguing that it is time to unlearn the Goldwater lesson and reject another Romney.

'Only way to defeat Obama'
A few days ago here in Columbia, Gingrich's campaign bus rolled past a parked red-white-and-blue race car painted with the words "Tea Party" and "Newtmobile." His party's internecine struggle, conservatives overpowering moderates, has been the defining mission of Gingrich's political career. In the decade after Reagan, he inspired his own version of a conservative revolution on Capitol Hill, helping take down the presidency of a Republican moderate, the elder George Bush, along the way.
Now he is engaged in one more battle. His bus pulled to a stop in front of Phillip's Market, where Gingrich implored attendees at a town hall meeting not to nominate Romney. Speaking matter-of-factly, with his trademark air of certitude, the former House speaker argued that Romney's record on health care and other key issues would make a sharp ideological contrast with Obama impossible.
"Do you want somebody who is a moderate?" Gingrich asked, adding: "What you want is somebody like this, like Reagan was with Carter. You want a real conservative. . . . The only way to defeat Obama is to nominate an articulate conservative who has the courage to be tough enough to go nose-to-nose with him."
The crowd erupted, chanting "Newt, Newt, Newt."
A few hours later, at a candidate forum downtown, Gingrich concluded his pitch to local businessmen by warning that if he didn't win the South Carolina primary on Saturday, "we will probably nominate a moderate, and the odds are fairly high he will lose to Obama."
Gingrich the historian has some history on his side. The record of the most moderate-seeming nominees in recent general elections has been lackluster. Gerald Ford held off Reagan at the boisterous 1976 convention in Kansas City, Mo., only to lose in the fall to Jimmy Carter. Both George H.W. Bush and Dole survived conservative insurgencies only to fall to Clinton; McCain bested Mike Huckabee, a darling of social conservatives, only to get trounced by Obama.

After success, divisions
Past conservative also-rans said they relate to the current field's aggravation, but they also noted that the present conservative predicament is a result of their success a half-century ago in running George Romney and the more liberal Rockefeller Republicans out of the party.
"They are dead, and so we have taken over," said Pat Buchanan, who lost the nomination to Dole in 1996 after unexpectedly winning the New Hampshire primary. "When the revolution took over, you had the Leninists and the Trotskyites and the Bukharinites and the whole thing. Once the revolution succeeds, it doesn't mean that we're all unified. But the new divisions rise."
"The conservatives have not presented a united front," Pat Robertson concurred in an e-mail. While the Christian leader, who lost to George H.W. Bush in 1988, lamented that "Republicans don't consider certain fringe candidates as electable," he took solace in noting that "for a non-office-holding amateur, my third-place showing in the contest was respectable."
This cycle, as conservatives sense a rare opportunity to depose a sitting president, they want more than a respectable finish.
Gary Bauer, a leader in the social conservative movement who lost to the "compassionate conservatism" of George W. Bush in 2000, said he had "the Bush train run over me several times." Last weekend, he helped organize an emergency meeting of evangelicals in Texas to try to find consensus on a conservative candidate to halt Romney's seemingly unstoppable glide toward the nomination. Former senator Rick Santorum(Pa.), whom Bauer backed, emerged as the nominal conservative alternative. But there is no sudden peace in South Carolina to suggest that Gingrich or Texas Gov. Rick Perryacknowledges him as such.
"There ends up being a number of candidates competing for this vote, and it naturally gets divided," Bauer said.
He attributed the high number of conservative candidates to the overwhelming success of the Reagan revolution, which, in its utter domination of the GOP, has left little ideological room between establishment candidates and grass-roots contenders. As a result, Bauer said, it is "harder for insurgent candidacies - whether it's Buchanan or my effort in 2000 - to rally enough discontent with the way things are to be successful."

'Try and label each other'
The conservative dominance of the party has also made it easier for Romney to follow a well-worn path toward the nomination. At the debate in Myrtle Beach, S.C., on Monday night, he spent a good portion of his time watching Gingrich, Santorum and Perry joust for the title of conservative king. When not attacking one another on television, in gun shops or at barbecue joints, the three rivals have focused their efforts on tagging Romney as another conservative manque who would govern as a moderate.
But even as Romney's competitors - especially Gingrich - make a spirited stand in South Carolina, the Romney camp exudes confidence. "Oh, they are doing their job," South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, a Romney supporter, said of the attacks with a dismissive chuckle. "You know in a primary, you try and hit each other. You try and label each other."
Because of Romney's moderate pedigree, as well as positions he took as a Senate candidate and as governor of Massachusetts that put him well outside the conservative norm, he has spent the past six years trying to convince conservatives that he is one of them. During the debate in Myrtle Beach, a Twitter user asked him to "convince me you won't change again." He renounced - again - any hint of moderation in his past on social issues such as abortion and gay rights, and he launched into a litany of beliefs that placed him firmly within the conservative mainstream.
"I believe in free enterprise, I believe in freedom, I believe in liberty, I believe in an opportunity society," he said. "And everything I do will be designed to strengthen the values of this country, to strengthen the families of this country, to strengthen our economy and to keep a military that is second to none in the world."
After the debate, Romney's advisers continued where he left off. In 2008, some of the same people who are now calling the candidate too moderate "were begging Romney to stay in against McCain, and his positions haven't changed one iota," said Ron Kaufman, a Romney adviser. "So there really isn't a moderate in this race."

Massachusetts vs. Utah
Kaufman is no stranger to candidates whom conservatives have considered too centrist. In 1980, he worked for George H.W. Bush against the conservative prince, Reagan, and later he played a large role in Bush's nomination over Robertson and Buchanan, going on to serve as Bush's White House political director. He said that perceptions of Romney, and himself, as moderates have more to do with the geography and culture of their home states than the ideology they espouse.
"If Mitt didn't change one comma in one issue but was running from Utah, he wouldn't be a moderate," Kaufman said. "It's more cultural and touchy-feely than reality."
For now.
Little seems real in a campaign season, especially one as loopy as this one. But for all of Romney's testaments to his unwavering conservatism, the great fear of conservatives is that he knows what it takes to get elected, and that once in office he would resurrect his father's moderate sensibility.
"Mitt knows he has to do these things where his father failed," said Kabaservice, the scholar. "What we don't know yet is what his turn back towards the center would be like."

'I've been threatened more than Obama'

BYLINE: Dana Hedgpeth

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B01

LENGTH: 1190 words

Carmelita Mullen pulled her 40-foot-long Metrobus to a stop near the Congress Heights station.
Five young men, wearing hooded sweatshirts and baseball caps that made it difficult to see their faces, waited to board.
"I don't like a group like that," said Mullen, a petite presence behind the bus's huge steering wheel, as she prepared to open the door. "There's so many of them. Seems like they're up to no good.
"It kinda makes you nervous. There's no secret; things happen over here."
The men piled onto Mullen's bus and went on their way after riding for a few stops. Nothing happened. But recent violence aboard buses has drivers such as Mullen clamoring for protection - and police pursuing ways to increase safety. 
Drivers, who say they have been targeted when they try to enforce rules or people don't want to pay fares, have been spat upon, cursed, punched, pepper-sprayed and grabbed by the throat, police say. In one case, a woman beat up a bus operator at the Capitol Heights station after she was asked to fold a child's stroller.
Police and union officials have developed guidelines on how bus operators should respond to violence. One of them is: Open the doors and evacuate if there's an active shooting.
That's not far-fetched. In October, a passenger died after he was shot in the face on a Metrobus.
Metro said police have increased patrols. Twenty-two members of a special enforcement unit regularly ride buses in uniform and plainclothes. (There were three riding aboard Mullen's bus whom she didn't know about.)
The transit authority is also considering installing barriers between drivers and passengers. Officials had proposed installing 250 shields made of aluminum and clear polycarbonate. The shields, which cost $1,500 to $2,500 each, depending on the type of bus, close like gates after operators are buckled into their seats. Riders can talk to the operators through small holes in the top part of the shield.
The transit authority scaled back the plan after some board members questioned whether that would alarm riders.
"We want our bus operators to feel safe," said D.C. Council member Muriel Bowser (D-Ward 4), who is a member of the Metro board. But "I'm uncomfortable with the notion" of the shields. "I'm not sure how the actual assaults justify walling off the bus drivers. I'm not sure a case has been made."
Officials now expect to roll out shields on 100 buses this winter and spring as a test, assigning the vehicles to the Bladensburg and Four Mile bus divisions, and areas where there have been attacks on operators.
"We think of this as a low-cost way to gauge effectiveness, as well as employee and customer reaction, before advancing a wider rollout," said Dan Stessel, Metro's chief spokesman.

Optional shields
Some riders say they see the need for the shields and fear for the safety of drivers. 
On a recent afternoon, passengers riding on the U5, which runs from near the Minnesota Avenue Station to areas around Benning Road, said they support the idea.
"I think it is wonderful," said Audrey Cockeran, 77, who lives in Southeast Washington. "Because if the driver is not protected, then we're not protected. It starts with the bus operator. . . . He doesn't have too much self-defense against four or five teenagers or a drunk who comes after him. I've heard drivers say, 'Put your cigarette out.' And they don't do nothing but fuss and curse at him."
Sitting a few seats away, rider Peggy Pickett nodded her head in agreement.
"Anything that protects drivers is good," she said. "People get on, and I've seen them get nasty.  . . . They don't want to pay the fare. They don't want to turn the music down. Sometimes they're picking at other passengers. You've got to be protected."
Metrobus operators won't be required to use the shields but will have the option to use them on certain routes.
Officials say their buses are safe for passengers and drivers, especially relative to the size of the system. On an average weekday, 2,450 bus operators drive 453,000 passengers on 155 lines in the District, Maryland and Virginia.
In 2009, there were 71 assaults on bus operators, according to Metro. That figure jumped to 90 in 2010 and dipped back to 44 from January through September 2011. 
But the numbers don't reflect arguments and lesser incidents. Some operators say they fight a war of words every day.
 "No sooner than I am past Capitol Hill, and I have to get my defensive side up because of the nature of the environment," said one operator who works out of Metro's Western Division. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he feared retribution.
"It goes from being called 'No, sir; yes, sir' to four-letter words," he said. "They want to sometimes argue with you over a $1.70 fare."
Like many operators, he has mixed feelings about the shields. "It's a shame I have to be put in a cage to do my job," said the driver, who has worked with Metro for more than two years.
Rodney Jones, a bus operator who drives routes mostly in Southeast Washington, said he thinks the shields are "an intrusion."
"It doesn't have that personal touch that you normally get when you can high-five a 5-year-old," he said. But, he said, operators are being targeted.
"I've been with Metro less than a year, and I've been threatened more than Obama," he said, referring to the president.
It isn't the first time Metro has considered putting in bus shields. In 2008, it installed some shields after talking with Metro's union. 
A survey of bus operators done at that time found that 70 percent didn't like the shields, said Phil Wallace, managing director for Metro's bus maintenance.
The rest of those surveyed - mostly female bus operators, according to Wallace - said they liked the shields and felt more protected with them, especially when working late-night shifts.
Metro officials warn that the bus shields aren't a cure-all.
"Is this going to keep someone who really wants to harm you away?" Wallace said. "Probably not. This is a deterrent."

Increased patrols
Many riders said they also would like to see more transit officers riding buses. Police said that's one reason they believe the number of assaults have dropped. Police are attending bus operator safety meetings to understand where incidents are happening and then targeting those routes with increased patrols, including plainclothes officers, Metro said. 
Metro General Manager Richard Sarles has asked for money in_blank the transit authority's next budget to hire more officers to patrol buses.
Riders also have said they want working cameras installed on every bus. About 1,155 of Metro's 1,492 buses have cameras that are constantly recording. According to a bus official, 75 cameras are not working and are beyond repair. Metro said it expects to have 1,400 buses equipped with cameras by July.
Back on her route, Mullen said more cameras that work - and shields - would make her feel safer.
"People talk about reality TV," she said. "This is reality."

'I'm not looking for a handout'

BYLINE: Eli Saslow

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A01

LENGTH: 2053 words

DATELINE: IN CONWAY, S.C.

He awoke to his alarm on Monday morning at 6, just like always, even though his handwritten schedule for the day read only: "Find something to do!" Steven Murdock, 39, poured himself a cup of coffee and rummaged through the defrosted Thanksgiving leftovers in an otherwise barren refrigerator. 
He grabbed the phone that bill collectors were threatening to turn off and made his first call of the day. 
"I need some kind of odd job to help me get by," he told a neighbor. "Know of anything?" 
It was the beginning of another workweek in a town with too little work, and all around Murdock, the South Carolina economy of 2012 stirred to life. Forty people formed a line outside the downtown food bank, carrying empty plastic bags they hoped would be filled. Dozens more waited for sunrise at the unemployment office. A sign at the Department of Social Services directed all comers to an overflow parking lot, built to accommodate the 25 percent of Conway's population that now survived primarily on government support.
Murdock was no longer among them. In the 14 months since he lost his $11-an-hour construction job, his options had been whittled down to this morning routine of cold calls to friends and neighbors. His weekly unemployment benefits had expired. His food stamps had been trimmed to less than $50 a week. His bank account was in the red, his hot water was turned off, and he no longer had health insurance to treat a pinched nerve or bouts of depression. Lately, his only medication was the pep talks he gave himself between phone calls. 
"Nobody else is going to turn this around for you," he said as he readied to dial again. "Get off your ass. Make something happen. Sink or swim."
As South Carolina prepares to hold its Republican primary Saturday, the economically depressed state already has revealed a definitive issue of the 2012 presidential campaign: How can government best serve a record number of jobless and poor? What should happen to the Steven Murdocks? 
There is President Obama's vision, which Republican opponents call "a European welfare state": People like Murdock are entitled to government help during a time of extreme hardship, no matter the cost.
And there is the Republican vision, which Obama calls "you're-on-your-own economics": A government burdened by debt must encourage self-sufficiency, even when it seems harsh.
Does cutting government support programs leave people to fail or free them to succeed? 
Sink or swim? 
Murdock believed he could swim. He had worked six days a week ever since he dropped out of high school at 16, moving out of his parents' house to take a job in construction. In the years since, he had made his living as a plumber, a manager at a Pizza Hut, a beer distributor, a tobacco picker, a truck driver, a mover, a framer and a landscaper. He had never been married; his friends had been work friends, and his free time had gone to overtime. 
He picked up the phone and tried another neighbor. "Need some yardwork done? Some raking? Maybe a power wash?" 
Another: "I'm not looking for a handout. I don't want a free ride."
He took out a cigarette and turned on the TV. Mitt Romney was making a stump speech across the state, reciting what had become one of his trademark lines: "Are we going to have an entitlement society or an opportunity society?" 
Murdock switched over to the Weather Channel. He had always hated politics and did not plan to vote, but he did love the United States and believed in the concept of opportunity - "in taking only what's yours and finding a way to make it yourself," he said. To that end, he had already applied for more than 60 jobs in the past year. He had already sold his lawn mower, his car, his guns and his tools. He had already become a regular at all three of Conway's day-labor centers, where the contractors charged him to rent back those same tools on the rare occasions they offered him work. He had already painted a neighbor's laundry room for $30 and washed a friend's car for $10. 
And on this day, he had already called everyone who he thought might be able to hire him for an odd job.
"Looks like it's the last resort," he said. 
During the previous month, he had taken to picking up cans and scrap metal along the road. It made him feel like a bum, he said, but he had managed to fill seven bags with aluminum cans and other recyclables. Now he loaded them into a friend's pickup truck and drove a few miles south, toward Myrtle Beach. They pulled up to a warehouse where the owner purchased scrap metal. Murdock grabbed his bags and set them onto an industrial scale, stale beer spilling onto his hands and his jeans. 
"Twenty-seven pounds at 35 cents per pound," an employee said. He punched the numbers into a calculator, rounded up and handed Murdock $9.50.
This was today's opportunity. 
"Thanks," Murdock said. He crumpled the bills into his pocket and walked back to the truck. 
The crumpled bills bought more cans, and Murdock came back to his house a few hours later with a six-pack of Bud Ice and sat down on the porch. He had gained 22 pounds in the past several months, all of it in his stomach, trading the chiseled physique of his years as a beer-warehouse manager for the soft features of a beer drinker. He wore jeans, a baseball cap and a T-shirt, no matter the temperature. He shuffled when he walked on account of a bad back, and his beard was just starting to gray.
"Funny how fast you can start to feel old," he said. 
His father had died of a heart attack at 60, and Murdock had spent the past decade trying to fill the role of caretaker for a family that needed plenty of help. He had earned as much as $700 a week in the last job he had, and instead of saving for himself he had spent on everyone else. He took his mother out to lunch once a week in Conway. He gave his sister, a single mother, a few twenties every month to help her support twin daughters. He hosted barbecues for his friends and started dating a woman 11 years his junior. Every time she came over to his house, he would pretend to run an errand but sneak out to fill her gas tank instead. 
Being dependable had made him feel good. 
Being dependent was keeping him awake at nights with insomnia and in bed some days with depression. The more that people took care of him after he lost his job, the more despondent he had become. His girlfriend had earned a steady salary as a mail carrier, and she started to pay for them both when they went out to bowl or shoot pool. He loathed himself for it and started to resent her, so they had broken up after seven years. 
His mother had paid a $200 electric bill for him even though she had recently lost her job, too, so now he kept the thermostat in his house at 58 degrees. His sister was slipping him a few dollars when she could, even though she had not been able to find full-time work. The friends he still had were tired of giving him rides to drop off job applications or buying him cigarettes. "I'm a grown man, and I'm relying on everybody else," Murdock said. 
So many other Americans were also reliant, and their collective burden had become the main topic in South Carolina during the past few weeks. Ten percent of adults in Conway, population 18,000, receive unemployment insurance. More than 46 million Americans receive food stamps, nearly double the number in 2006. Almost one-quarter of the federal budget in 2010 was spent on programs to keep people out of poverty or to help those already facing it.
Under the leadership of its conservative governor, Nikki Haley, South Carolina had pioneered cutbacks that some Republicans wanted to institute across the country, reducing basic unemployment insurance from 26 weeks to 20 and eliminating it for seasonal employees. Haley also had become a tea party hero by suggesting mandatory drug tests for everyone who received government support.
"Government dependency can only foster passivity and sloth," Romney said on the campaign trail. 
"Our success has never been about survival of the fittest," Obama said. 
An entitlement culture is a "fundamental corruption of the American spirit," Romney said. 
"We pitch in. We do our part. We have a stake in each other's success," Obama said.
None of the politicians involved in the debate had as much at stake as Murdock, but he had numbed himself to the election and everything else that reminded him of his dependency. Lately, his favorite part of each day was evenings like this one, when he could sit on his porch at the end of a dark road, look up at the stars, drink a beer, listen to geese land on the pond across the street and throw a tennis ball to the two dogs that continued to rely on him.
Another morning, another round of phone calls, and this time the only person who offered work was his mother. She needed her yard raked and cleaned, she said. Murdock agreed to take care of it, even though raking aggravated his back more than anything else. He took two pain pills and rode 25 minutes with a friend to her house in Myrtle Beach. 
Kitty Murdock had spent the past year grappling with one of the toughest parenting challenges of her life. How could she care for a proud, adult son without crushing his self-esteem? She had decided to help him only in ways that seemed motherly, she said, calling him every night and dropping by now and then with a jacket she found on sale at Wal-Mart or an inexpensive pair of shoes. This morning, she greeted her son in her kitchen with hot coffee, fresh banana bread, an extra bag of chicken legs from the freezer and laundry soap so he could wash his clothes. 
"You doing okay?" she asked. 
"I'm good," he said.
She could afford to help him only so much, since she had spent the past year relying on help herself. She had worked for 20 years as a retail buyer for local amusement parks until the company downsized in 2010. "I'm retired," she had told friends then, smiling. But now she had blown through the modest savings intended to send her grandchildren to college and started searching for red stickers at the grocery store's meat counter. She had two weeks left of her unemployment insurance and no job prospects in Myrtle Beach, a tourism town with diminished tourism in the summer and none now in January. 
"Real retirement will never be an option now," she said. She sat at a table in her sunroom and watched her son work, his gray shirt darkening with sweat as he stuffed leaves into 20 bags, 30, 40. This was Murdock's favorite kind of task, one that would take all day and end with the visual satisfaction of a clean yard, a job well done, some tangible sense of accomplishment. 
But it was also hard labor, and now his mother wondered: Should she pay him? She had agreed to give his friend $40 for the day, but she and Murdock had not discussed money. 
"He looks like his old self when he helps somebody," she said now, still watching him. She had never seen him happier in the past year than at Christmastime, when he spent a week tearing up a neighbor's carpet and then surprised her with two tickets for a Christmas show at one of the resort hotels in Myrtle Beach. She was overwhelmed by the gift, but it was the memory of Murdock watching her open it - leaning in over her shoulder, beaming with pride, "Oh, no, it was nothing, Mom" - that had stuck with her long after the show. 
Maybe it would be best to let this yardwork be another gift, another boost for his self-worth.
But a friend in Conway had mentioned seeing Murdock at the soup kitchen. His work boots looked ratty, and his clothes needed to be washed. He had told her that it had been a slow week, only $9.50 earned so far, by collecting and selling aluminum cans.
Maybe it would be best to pay him. 
Murdock and his friend came inside and grabbed glasses of water. "Seventy bags," he said, nodding with satisfaction. Kitty patted him on the shoulder. "I don't know what I'd do without you," she said. She paid his friend $40 and then reached back into her purse and found another $10. She thought the amount was big enough to sustain her son but small enough to preserve the fact that his work had been a favor. She held out the money for him.
Here it was, the latest transaction in the ongoing debate over dependency.
Opportunity?
Entitlement?
Murdock shook his head. Kitty continued to hold out the bill. 
"Please," she said. "You need it."

Key al-Qaeda figure killed in drone strike
A militant who acted as a senior operations organizer for al-Qaeda was killed in one of two U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan last week, a U.S. official said.
U.S. and Pakistani sources said the target of the attack was Aslam Awan, a Pakistani from Abbottabad, the town where Osama bin Laden was killed. The sources said Awan died in a drone strike on Jan. 10 directed at what news reports said was a compound near the town of Miran Shah, in the northwestern tribal region of North Waziristan.
That strike broke an undeclared eight-week hiatus in U.S. attacks by the armed, unmanned drones in Pakistan. 
The sources described Awan, also known as Abdullah Khorasani, as a significant figure inthe remaining leadership of al-Qaeda, which U.S. officials say has been sharply reduced by the drone campaign.

Bomb blast kills 6;group closes 2 clinics
A bombing killed two Somali policemen and four refugees Thursday close to a camp for displaced people in the capital, Mogadishu, the African Union's peacekeeping force in Somalia said.
A police spokesman said the explosion appeared to target a police checkpoint near the camp. A second bomb that failed to detonate was found nearby.
Bombings and suicide attacks have been on the rise in the coastal city since August when the al-Shabab rebel group pulled most of its fighters out of the city.
Thursday's attack, which happened after U.N. officials and foreign journalists had watched food being distributed to refugees, underlined the dangers that tens of thousands of Somalis displaced by war and famine face each day. Earlier, a hand grenade was hurled at a U.N. compound in Mogadishu. There were no casualties.
Also Thursday, the international aid agency Doctors Without Borders said it has shuttered two major medical centers in the capital after two of its workers were shot dead by a former colleague last month. The 120-bed centers are the largest of the group's 13 projects in Somalia.

Eight police officers guilty in prison riot
A judge convicted eight police officers Thursday in a landmark trial for their role in a prison riot during which at least 10 prisoners were shot to death in the chaotic aftermath of the January 2010 earthquake.
The prosecution, concluding two years to the day after the uprising, was considered at least a small victory for the court system of an impoverished nation where criminal cases seldom reach trial.
Judge Ezekiel Vaval said six other police officers were innocent as he ended the three-month trial in the southwestern town of Les Cayes.
One of those convicted was a senior officer who fled before the trial and was convicted in absentia after witnesses testified he took part in the killings. The seven others convicted were present during the trial.
The police officers were accused of murder and other crimes after they allegedly opened fire on inmates during the prison riot.
Sentences ranged from two years to 13 years of hard labor. The defendants had faced the possibility of up to life in prison.

Going Out Guide's family movie reviews

Beauty and the Beast 3D (G).ג[#x20ac][#x201a]Disney has digitally remastered its lovely 1991 animated musical classic in 3-D, and it remains a delight. But parents of kids younger than 8 should note that the wolves that surround Belle's father in the forest, and that later threaten her, are even more frightening in 3-D. In 1991, this was a groundbreaking film because it mixed hand-drawn animation with backgrounds created using computers. The result is still stunning, and the songs still great. 
THE BOTTOM LINE: Aside from the more intense 3-D scenes with the wolves, other elements that catch one's attention two-plus decades later: The girls in Belle's village are a tad more buxom than they'd probably be today. The big fight shows Gaston falling to his (presumable) death. The Beast is wounded.

Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close.ג[#x20ac][#x201a]Teens who respond to strong drama and historic events will embrace this quirky film about the emotional fallout of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Based on the novel by Jonathan Safran Foer, Oskar Schell (extraordinary newcomer Thomas Horn) is a brilliant, anxiety-plagued 11-year-old who is trying to absorb the fact that his dad, Thomas, died in the attacks. Oskar adored his father, a fun-loving jeweler who understood his son's emotional issues (Oskar tells us he may or may not have Asperger's syndrome). Now, a year after 9/11, Oskar can't open up to his still-grieving mother. He has found a mysterious key in his father's closet, in an envelope with the name "Black" on it. He decides that finding what lock the key fits is crucial to his peace of mind.
THE BOTTOM LINE: The movie explores how children and adults deal with grief. It has images both real and stylized of the burning World Trade Center towers and of falling bodies. While intense and upsetting, the images are not graphic. The script includes occasional crude language and midrange profanity. 
Red Tails.ג[#x20ac][#x201a]Teens will absorb a slice of history about World War II and the pre-civil rights era in this unsubtle action picture. Some of the dialogue is awfully clunky, but a strong cast and thrilling aerial dogfight sequences largely overcome that. Though fictionalized, "Red Tails" is based on the fabled Tuskegee Airmen. The film follows the struggle of the pilots and their commanding officers to be taken seriously in a military stymied by racist attitudes. 
The bottom line: Injuries and crashes during the aerial dogfights are not overly graphic. The script includes rare midrange profanity, racial slurs and crude language. There is an implied overnight tryst between a pilot and an Italian woman. 
Joyful Noise.ג[#x20ac][#x201a]Kids 12 and older who like comedies about grown-ups acting silly and a touch of spiritual revival might have a little fun with "Joyful Noise." Vi Rose Hill is named director of the church choir in a financially struggling Georgia hamlet, which miffs G.G., a wealthy choir member. G.G.'s wayward grandson comes to stay and immediately starts courting Vi's daughter. There's too much poorly directed plot, but the singing and corny humor make up for it - kinda. 
THE BOTTOM LINE: The script includes a couple of barnyard epithets and mild sexual slang. Two secondary characters, both single, have sex out of wedlock.

R
Contraband.ג[#x20ac][#x201a]Most high-schoolers 15 and older will be able to handle this solidly crafted and well-performed action flick, which earns its R more for language than gore. They won't be as aware of its many crime-saga cliches as older filmgoers will. Chris Farraday is a New Orleans family guy who installs burglar alarms. Chris has given up a successful career as a smuggler. His dad is in prison, and Chris wants a different life. Then his wife's inept kid brother botches a job smuggling cocaine for a violent local dealer. Chris feels he must get back into smuggling to cover his brother-in-law's debt and save his life. Things go awry, and Chris's wife and kids are violently threatened. 
THE BOTTOM LINE: The "Contraband" script warrants an R for strong profanity, an instance of crudely misogynist sexual slang and the depiction of children's lives threatened by criminals. There is one steamy marital kiss. The action sequences feature loud gun battles, hard fights and violent crashes. Injuries and deaths are bloody but not exceptionally so. A recovering alcoholic falls off the wagon, drinking and snorting cocaine.
In the Land of Blood and Honey.ג[#x20ac][#x201a]College-age cinema buffs will be moved and impressed by this saga of the Bosnian civil war in the 1990s. There is never any sense that the film is a vanity project for writer-director Angelina Jolie. She has made a highly effective film, with a love story involving Bosnian artist Ajla and Serbian policeman Danijel. Motives grow blurred as the violence worsens. 
The bottom line: Strictly for audiences older than 17, "In the Land of Blood and Honey" depicts rape, shootings of noncombatants and Nazi-style roundups for "ethnic cleansing." Other mayhem includes bombings, point-blank shootings and the implied death of an infant. Consensual sexual situations, as well as the rapes, are explicitly portrayed.

Munson retakes the court

BYLINE: Kathy Orton

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. D06

LENGTH: 973 words

During a recent _blankUniversity of the District of Columbia basketball practice, _blankNigel Munson spotted a teammate open underneath the basket and whipped him the ball. Unfortunately, the player was unprepared for Munson's pass and the ball glided through his hands and out of bounds. 
"He'd have two or three more assists a game if these guys could hang on to the ball and make their shots," grumbled Coach Jeff Ruland, the former Washington Bullets star who is in his third season at UDC, a Division II program.  
Munson appeared indifferent to his teammate's blunder as he hustled down the court to play defense. The former DeMatha standout whose career at _blankVirginia Tech looked so promising his freshman year is just happy to be playing basketball, even if it is in a dingy gym located in an industrial park-like structure known as Building 47 on UDC's campus in Northwest Washington. 
It's far from the glamour of the ACC. But it's basketball, and that's enough for Munson. 
"I love basketball," Munson said. "I've got a passion for it." 
Division II can be a refuge for players and coaches who, for whatever reason, lost their way at Division I. Three of Munson's teammates are Division I transfers, and Ruland spent nine years as coach of his alma mater, Iona, taking the Gaels to three NCAA tournaments before being fired in 2007. 
No one would have guessed Munson would wind up at a Division II school when he was at DeMatha. He was the point guard on one of the best teams in the area, if not the country. His final two years, the Stags went 63-3 and won two Washington Catholic Athletic Conference titles. His senior season, DeMatha was ranked No. 4 nationally by USA Today. 
Several of his _blankfellow first-team All-Met members in 2006 - Player of the Year _blankKevin Durant, Scottie Reynolds, Chris Wright, Austin Freeman, _blankGreivis Vasquezand Eric Hayes - would go on to have outstanding college careers. Munson, however, took a more circuitous path.
By most accounts, Munson flourished his freshman year at Virginia Tech. He averaged three points, 1.1 assists and 11.1 minutes. He made the game-tying free throw at North Carolina to help the Hokies upset the then-No. 4 Tar Heels in overtime. 
"I thought everything was great," said Anthony Langley, Munson's AAU coach. "The next thing I know he's like, 'I'm not going back,' and I'm in a state of shock. I think everybody was." 
Munson cited two reasons for his departure: He wanted to be closer to his family and he was unnerved by the April 16, 2007, massacre at the school that claimed the lives of 32 people. 
"I think if the shooting didn't happen and the family situation, I would have stuck it out at Virginia Tech 'cause I think it was a good fit for me," Munson said. "Everything was so crazy. I wanted to come back home, and being homesick, all that played in." 
But Langley also thinks that Munson needed a break from the pressures and demands of high-level basketball. 
"He had been on this whirlwind basketball, I guess, treadmill," he said. "I think he just had to figure out what he wanted to do, and it basically took two years."
George Washington appeared the front-runner to land Munson after he announced he was leaving Virginia Tech. George Mason, Georgetown and American also were possibilities. But Munson didn't end up at any of those schools or any other for the next two years. Instead, he took a job with UPS. He later worked with the D.C. Department of Parks and Recreation. 
All the while, Munson kept playing basketball, albeit at rec centers rather than college arenas. Although his competition had dropped off significantly, he tried to keep improving. 
"I never needed nobody around me to work on my game," he said. "So I would go to the gym and shoot, even if I couldn't run up and down the court." 
Munson eventually decided to return to school and approached Langley to help him. They realized a Division II school was his best option, because it doesn't operate under the same time constraints that Division I does. (An athlete must complete his five years of competition within five years of his enrollment in school, unless he is granted a medical or other hardship waiver.) 
Langley started calling the coaches he knew. Former George Mason assistant Chris Caputo mentioned Munson to Ruland. Langley also called Terrell Stokes, an assistant on Ruland's staff and former Maryland point guard. 
Now, after two discouraging years - Munson missed the second half of his first season, in which the Firebirds went 1-20, and he was suspended for the first semester of his second season because of academics - UDC is on the verge of a special season. The Firebirds, who joined the East Coast Conference this season after years as an independent, won 11 consecutive games to rise to No. 22 in the polls _blankuntil falling to Bridgeport, 77-75, last Saturday. The loss sent them _blanktumbling out of the rankings, but their _blank90-58 win over Mercy on Wednesday improved their record to 14-2, 5-1. 
Munson, 25, has played a big part in UDC's success. He is the team's second-leading scorer (19.5 points per game) and ranks seventh in Division II in assists per game (6.4). He twice has been selected the ECC player of the week. And despite all the time he has missed, he is just 29 points shy of 1,000 for his career. 
After all he's been through, Munson has proven he's a survivor.
"I'm a better man," he said. "Basically, I've learned how to not give up when stuff is thrown your way. Basically, not giving up and keep fighting through 'cause life is not perfect. You'll have stuff thrown your way. You've just got to keep going strong and go hard.
"If you believe in something and your passionate about something, like I am about basketball, it was worth fighting for. I just wanted to stay with it because I love it so much."

No justice for Mr. Mubarak

BYLINE: Editorial Board

SECTION: EDITORIAL COPY; Pg. A18

LENGTH: 501 words

SINCE TAKING power 11 months ago, Egypt's ruling military council has perpetrated a host of injustices. It has subjected some 12,000 civilians to summary military trials, in which 8,000 have been convicted. It has imprisoned bloggers and liberal activists while shielding police and troops who have shot and killed protesters. It launched raids against American and U.S.-financed non-government groups involved in human rights and democracy promotion. 
To all that must be added this: The generals have also staged a trial for their former president, Hosni Mubarak, that in every respect has been a travesty.
Mr. Mubarak, who is 83 and reported to be gravely ill, has been transported from a military hospital to a cage in a Cairo courtroom several days this month for prosecution on both civil and criminal charges, ranging from premeditated murder to economic corruption.  His co-defendants include his two sons, his former interior minister, four senior police officials and a businessman. Scores of lawyers crowd the courtroom, purporting to represent the families of his victims. 
This would be a process of massive complexity if it were scrupulously carried out; thousands of witnesses have been listed by the prosecution and defense. Yet the judge has allotted just a handful of days this month and next to completing the trial, including five sessions for Mr. Mubarak's defense. The prosecution has already wrapped up its case - and has demanded that the former president and his interior minister be given the death penalty.
Mr. Mubarak is likely guilty of serious crimes, including complicity in the death of protesters during the popular revolution against his government last year. But the prosecution has presented almost no hard evidence to establish his guilt. Instead they have delivered flowery speeches denouncing Mr. Mubarak's regime, along with what amounts to conjecture. The president, they say, must have been asked for permission to fire on protesters; or should have done something to stop it; or is ultimately responsible as president for any crimes committed by his regime.
Even some Egyptian human rights activists, to their credit, are dismayed by the shoddiness of this case. "The prosecution's position could motivate the emotions of the people, but it has no effect in terms of legality," Gamal Eid, an attorney working for families of slain protesters, told the Wall Street Journal. "Mubarak is a criminal, but from a legal point of view there is very weak evidence."
Observers in Cairo expect the result of this political case will be a political verdict. Mr. Mubarak will escape the death penalty but will be handed a long term in prison before being returned to his hospital bed. With this, the military council will hope to satisfy an increasingly restless public and pave the way for its own immunity from prosecution under the civilian government due to take power later this year. For all concerned - the generals, Mr. Mubarak and Egyptian society - this would be an injustice.

Monitors' mission in Syria expires

BYLINE: Liz Sly

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A12

LENGTH: 697 words

DATELINE: DAMASCUS, SYRIA

DAMASCUS, Syria - The mandate of a much-criticized Arab League monitoring mission in Syria expired Thursday amid calls from opposition activists to abandon the effort as a failure.
Arab ministers are scheduled to meet Sunday to decide whether to extend the mission for another month or seek tougher action against the government led by President Bashar al-Assad, whose crackdown on a 10-month-old uprising has left at least 5,000 people dead.
The estimated 125 monitors who are still in the country are awaiting the league's decision in their hotels after delivering a report on their activities Thursday. About 40 monitors have already left because they felt unsafe, said an Arab League official in Cairo who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the news media. 
Many activists and human rights groups, who initially campaigned for monitors to be admitted to the country, say they want Arab leaders to give up the mission and refer the Syrian crisis to the U.N. Security Council in the hope of securing tougher world condemnation of the crackdown.
The Syrian government, which resisted the dispatch of the monitors for weeks, has said it will agree to an extension.
The mission was widely criticized from the outset as too small and too restricted in its access to properly observe an uprising that has engulfed broad swaths of the country, although the two biggest cities, Damascus and Aleppo, remain largely unaffected.
The monitors are drawn from Arab countries that themselves routinely disregard human rights, and the mission's leader, Gen. Mohammed Ahmed al-Dabi, has been accused of complicity in war crimes in Sudan.
"The Arab leaders hate the Arab Spring because it brought democracy to the area, and none of them are democrats," said Omar Shakir, an activist reached in the city of Homs who is among those who want the mission called off in favor of U.N. action.
But the Arab League official said he expected the monitors' report to be harshly critical of Assad. There have been bigger demonstrations in more locations since the monitors arrived, an indication that their presence has given a boost to protesters, he said, adding that it has also drawn world attention to the crisis. "You cannot call it a failure," he said.
The government has also begun issuing visas to journalists, who have been almost completely denied access to the country for the past year. Allowing news media coverage of the events in Syria is one of the key demands of the Arab peace plan under which the monitors have been deployed.
But the mission's main purpose - observing the government's compliance with the peace plan - does not appear to have been fulfilled, mainly because there is little compliance to observe, the activists say.
The United Nations said last week that the killings had increased since the monitors arrived in December, and on Thursday, the human rights advocacy group Avaaz said 746 people had died during the mission. Activists say soldiers hold fire when monitors arrive in protest hot spots and then resume shooting when they have gone. The opposition Local Coordinating Committees said 26 people were killed Thursday.
At the same time, an escalating insurgency by rebels fighting in the name of the Free Syrian Army threatens to push the crisis in Syria beyond the reach of any peace plan.
The pullout of government troops and tanks from the mountain resort of Zabadani on Wednesday after five days of fighting between rebels and loyalists was hailed by members of the opposition as evidence that armed struggle is more likely than peaceful protests to succeed in pressuring the government.
Arab League monitors had visited Zabadani earlier in the week, but an activist in the town, who gave his name as Fares Mohammed, said they had nothing to do with the subsequent withdrawal.
"They stayed an hour and a half, and then they left," he said. "They are just watching; they are not protecting us. There is no purpose if they stay here."

Tuskegee Airmen deserve better

BYLINE: Mark Jenkins

SECTION: WEEKEND; Pg. T28

LENGTH: 444 words

Braving German guns on one wing and American racism on the other, the Tuskegee Airmen proved themselves some of the best combat pilots of World War II. The African American fliers' great achievement merits a great movie. "Red Tails" isn't it. 
The complexions of its heroes aside, this George Lucas-produced dogfight epic could have been made during the same decade the airmen helped beat Hitler. The war-movie cliches are as abundant as the antiaircraft fire, and the dialogue as wooden as a balsa glider. The leading characters are issued one personality trait apiece, and some don't even get that. Cuba Gooding Jr., for example, plays Maj. Emanuelle Stance as a man who smokes a pipe.
Stance commands the Red Tails - so called for their planes' color scheme - at their base in 1944 Italy. Meanwhile, Col. A.J. Bullard (Terrence Howard) is in Washington, battling Catch-22 military logic: The airmen haven't been assigned any significant missions, and the unit is in danger of being disbanded because it hasn't executed any significant missions. Bullard makes his case, and soon the airmen have a big gig: escorting U.S. bombers (earnestly termed "the heavies") as they lumber toward targets in Germany.
The Red Tails quickly impress the bomber crews with their discipline. The fighter pilots stick with the convoys, doing their job rather than veering off in search of glory. On an individual level, however, the flyboys show less self-control. Joe "Lightning" Little (David Oyelowo) is a hot dog who takes big risks in love as well as battle. Marty "Easy" Julian (Nate Parker) is so overwhelmed by the responsibility of being squadron leader that he regularly sips from a flask that doesn't contain iced tea.
There will be casualties, of course. But this is the sort of old-fashioned melodrama where at least one man who's presumed dead will turn up in time for the final credits. And the bullets the Red Tails dodge in midair are balanced by the raves they receive on the ground: They're regularly toasted, symbolically or actually, by white pilots whose bigotry has been dispelled by seeing the airmen in action. If only beating racism were that simple.
"Red Tails" works best when it speeds its message into the background. Assisted by a year's worth of postproduction at Lucas's Industrial Light and Magic, director Anthony Hemingway stages several pulse-boosting aerial battles. These sequences are all swoop, boom and rat-tat-tat - until some character opens his mouth to utter a line so stilted that it could have drawn giggles in 1946.

Requiem for a humble hero

BYLINE: Katherine Driessen

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B08

LENGTH: 651 words

Funeral services have become a familiar scene and, often, a reunion of sorts, for the remaining members of the Tuskegee Airmen, the first group of African American fighter pilots to serve in the military. And so it was once again Friday as a few of the men gathered at Arlington National Cemetery to say farewell to Lt. Col. Luke J. Weathers Jr.
"I've gone to more of these than I can count," said retired former Tuskegee Airman Bill Broadwater, 85, of Upper Marlboro. "It's getting down to just a few of us here." 
A new George Lucas filmis inspired by the first African American aerial combat unit, which fought in World War II. Fewer than 100 of the original 990 airmen remain.
The story of the Tuskegee Airmen, who fought against German forces even as they were considered second-class citizens on the home front, has gained greater prominence this year with the airing of a PBS documentary andthe Lucas movie, "Red Tails,"which debuted Friday.
The family of Weathers, who worked for the Federal Aviation Administration in the District, elected to bury him the day of the movie premiere, not so much because of the film as to make a gesture encouraging people to remember the airmen, family members said.
Many of the Tuskegee Airmen in attendance had already seen the movie in various pre-screenings - some attended a showing at the White House this month.
"Maybe it's a bit of a story," said retired Col. Charles E. McGee, who went through training with Weathers. "But it's based on the facts. It's good for people to remember."
Weathers, who died in October at 90, was not one for the spotlight, relatives said. Although Weathers has been credited with downing two German fighter planes that attacked one of the escorts he was leading and went on to receive a Congressional Gold Medal in 2007, he rarely spoke about his experience with his five children.
So when Lucasfilm sent his daughter, Trina Weathers Boyce, an advance copy of "Red Tails," she was surprised to realize near the end of the movie that her father was portrayed.
"I learned more about him in that movie than he ever told me," Weathers Boyce said. "I was like, 'Wow, that's my daddy.' "
His eldest daughter, Wanda Weathers Smith, said the only sign her father ever betrayed about the danger of his experience came at the frequent Tuskegee airmen reunions. Her father always took his own personal moment of silence to honor the men who had been lost in the war.
"That was his way," Weathers Smith said. "He didn't need to talk about it to pay respect to them."
On a gray, chilly Friday morning, it was Weathers's life that was honored. The service bore all the markers of military decorum: the flyover of four F-16s in a "missing-man formation," a color guard firing off a three-gun salute and a bugler playing taps as Weathers's flag-draped casket was lowered.
But after the service, the mood was less somber. Members of the East Coast chapter of Tuskegee Airmen, Inc., talked casually with Weathers's extensive family, which includes 10 grandchildren.
Broadwater, a former president of the chapter, noted that much of the legacy of the Tuskegee Airmen rests with future generations. The ranks of the airmen are dwindling at the annual reunions, and he bears increasing responsibility for outreach programs about them. Last year, he went to 16 speaking engagements in February, which is Black History Month. He also helps run the group's scholarship program, encouraging young blacks to pursue careers in aviation.
In August, the Tuskegee Airmen Inc. held its 40th annual convention at National Harbor in Prince George's County. Thirty-three names were read aloud at the convention's Lonely Eagle Ceremony, which marks the deaths of airmen with a punctuated ringing of a bell.
The ceremony has been taking a lot longer lately.
"I will be joining him [Weathers] soon," Broadwater said, laughing. "And I'm one of the young guys left."

Rushdie calls offvisit after threats
The controversial Indian-born British author Salman Rushdie canceled his visit to an Indian literary festival Friday after authorities warned he was a target for assassination following protests from local Muslim groups.
Senior Muslim clerics and some lawmakers had called for Rushdie to be banned from entering the country for the festival, Asia's largest, in the northern town of Jaipur. The calls reignited the controversy over his 1988 book, "The Satanic Verses," which some Muslims consider blasphemous.
Mindful of the Muslim vote in state elections next month, the government wavered, unwilling to guarantee Rushdie's security but equally reluctant to bar the Booker Prize-winning author. In the end, intelligence officials apparently warned him off.
Rushdie, 64, said he had received intelligence reports "that paid assassins from the Mumbai underworld may be on their way to Jaipur to eliminate me."
"While I have some doubts about the accuracy of this intelligence, it would be irresponsible of me to come to the festival in such circumstances," he said in a statement.
Rushdie is to address the opening day of the five-day festival by video link instead.

Permit for Moscow protest is denied
Moscow officials on Friday rejected an application by the opposition for a Feb. 4 protest march, citing security concerns.
The step appeared to be an opening gambit in a bid to drive a wedge into the opposition as the March 4 presidential election approaches - because some organizers have been willing to negotiate while others aren't.
Deputy Mayor Alexander Gorbenko said the city will suggest alternatives to the proposed march route and wants to move the protest to Feb. 5, the Interfax news agency reported. An opposition politician, Boris Nemtsov, said he was "mildly" optimistic an agreement could be reached.
Some of Nemtsov's colleagues are certain to be less accommodating. Feb. 4 was chosen because it is the 22nd anniversary of a pro-democracy march that led to the Communist Party's renunciation of its "leading role" in society. Opposition groups wanted to follow that march's route.

Sect claims blastsin large northern city
A series of bombings and gun attacks Friday claimed by a radical Islamist sect killed at least seven people in the largest city in Nigeria's Muslim north, witnesses said, threatening to engulf the region in violence.
The scope of the attacks suggested the death toll would rise.
The violence marked the first major assault by the Boko Haram sect on Kano, a predominantly Muslim city of more than 9 million people.

Amid unrest, U.S. may opt to close embassy in Damascus

BYLINE: Karen DeYoung;Liz Sly

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A10

LENGTH: 897 words

The Obama administration is preparing to evacuate American personnel and close the U.S. Embassy in Damascus, Syria, by the end of this month unless the embattled governmentof Syrian President Bashar al-Assad provides additional security for the facility, senior administration officials said.
Officials said they have not reached a final decision and are engaged in talks with the Assad government, but there so far have been no tangible results in providing more protection for the embassy. 
"We have serious concerns about the deteriorating security situation in Damascus, including the recent spate of car bombs, and about the safety and security of embassy personnel," a State Department release Friday evening said. "We have requested that the government of Syria take additional security measures to protect our embassy, and the Syrian government is considering that request. We have also advised the Syrian government that unless concrete steps are taken in the coming days we may have no choice but to close the mission."
A drawdown of the staff at the embassy, which is on a busy street in Damascus, began last week after three unexplained car bombings in recent weeks jarred the previously calm capital and left as many as 80 people dead.
Government claims that al-Qaeda was responsible for the recent attacks were widely scorned by activists who accused the government itself of responsibility. Although the administration has not ruled out Syrian government involvement in the attacks, U.S. officials said signs point to Syrian and Iraqi militants who have been affiliated with al-Qaeda.
"It smells like a terrorist attack and looks like a terrorist attack, but none of us knows for sure," said a senior Obama administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in discussing the sensitive situation.
Officials declined to discuss whether there have been specific threats to the embassy, and they would not describe the nature of the security measures they are seeking from the Assad government. But the suicide car bombings, the official said, "have brought the situation in Syria to another level."
If even a small number of Sunni extremists from Iraq have become involved in the Syrian conflict, it would add an alarming new dimension to what has been an overwhelmingly peaceful uprising that has been brutally attacked by the decades-old dictatorship. 
Many Syrian opposition activists already are concerned about signs of a creeping Islamization of the revolt, and they have warned that the failure of the West to intervene will open the door to Islamists, threatening the kind of destabilization that took hold in Iraq following the U.S.-led invasion there.
The senior administration official said that the deteriorating security situation across Syria "demonstrates further that Assad is losing control of the country and reinforces our point that Assad has lost all legitimacy."
Officials said that U.S. concerns were shared by other Western and Arab embassies in Damascus and that many had joined the United States in drawing down their staffs over the past week.
By explicitly warning that the embassy may close, the Obama administration appeared to be signaling Assad that its patience is running out. 
U.S. Ambassador Robert Ford was forced to leave Syria in October after receiving direct threats associated with regime supporters. He returned last month, after administration officials assessed that the threat had abated. Officials emphasized the importance of maintaining direct contact with opposition leaders and providing the opportunity of real-time reporting from Damascus.
On Friday, which has been the biggest day of the week for anti-government protests, Damascus felt as though it was under siege. Soldiers sealed off several major roads and checkpoints dotted the city. Outside one of the main offices of the security branches, there were sandbagged machine gun positions. Soldiers wearing flak jackets and holding machine guns kept guard.
A lone policeman with a Kalashnikov assault rifle slung over one shoulder stood across the street from the main entrance to the U.S. Embassy. There were also several soldiers and policemen dotted around the nearby traffic circle, but no more than at any other intersection.
Near the scene of the most recent bombing, outside the Zain Abeddine mosque in the neighborhood of Midan, hundreds of soldiers, police officers and plainclothes men belonging to what is known as the "shabiha" militia were out in force to prevent the eruption of protests after Friday prayers. Men streamed out of the mosque under their watchful eyes, and only one small group dared break into chants of "God is great" before they were quickly dispersed by the security forces.
Fearful merchants nearby said the overwhelming presence of security forces since the bombing had deterred all but a few protests in recent weeks. The attack had also kept customers away.
"Everyone is afraid," said one man selling pastries in a small shop. "Business is down below zero. No one knows what will happen next. Maybe there will be more bombings. Anything could happen."

Newt Gingrich's Southern swagger is selling in S.C.

BYLINE: Nia-Malika Henderson

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A08

LENGTH: 920 words

DATELINE: HARTSVILLE, S.C.

Hartsville, S.C. - At almost every campaign stop Newt Gingrich has made in this state, he finds an opportunity to remind his audiences that he is one of them: a Southerner proud of and devoted to the ways of the South.
"I'm Newt Gingrich. I want to thank the people of South Carolina for being so hospitable," he said onstage Thursday at CNN's Republican debate. "As a Georgian, it feels good to be back at home in the South." 
Gingrich has surged in the past few days after struggling to find a consistent theme in response to a barrage of attacks against him in Iowa. The resurgence owes a lot to Gingrich's strong debate performances, which have relied on a personal intangible that his opponents have been unable to match.
Call it Southern swagger.
Part of his success in South Carolina is attributable to his ability to meet people where they live, in the cultural sense, playing directly to their regional sense of self.
"We also have a very deep strain in us that often our intellectuals are terrified of, and it comes in part from South Carolina and from Western North Carolina and Tennessee. It's the Jacksonian tradition," Gingrich said at an event in Duncan, S.C., near the North Carolina border, last week. "[President Andrew] Jackson represented a Scotch-Irish tradition that was represented not far up the road here in Kings Mountain where the Americans cheerfully gathered together and slaughtered the British in revenge. . . . We are a tough country, we are a country that believes in a flag that has a snake on it that says 'Don't Tread On Me.' "
For Gingrich, South Carolina has been home turf and, rope line by rope line, he has won over people across this state who see in him a fellow traveler who speaks their language and can draw a clear contrast with President Obama.
They treat him like family, offering two-handed shakes, pats on the shoulder and "God bless you, Newt." Often, they lean in close to whisper in his ear or they will rattle off where they are from - Augusta, Orangeburg, Spartanburg - and run through their family lines to see if there are family ties.
On the debate stage, Gingrich is the happy Southern warrior, reading the crowds like a Baptist preacher searching for the Amen corner.
He has found a huge base of support, rousing the audiences to standing ovations, with his specific knowledge of state issues, and the pit-bull charisma of a well-mannered rebel.
"Mitt Romney, he's too much of a gentleman," said Tom Merriman, 56, of Lexington, S.C. "Newt is more confident and plainspoken."
In contrast to Romney, who has taken to dressing down and preferring to wear no tie, Gingrich almost always appears here in a suit and tie and prefers to lecture like the college professor he once was, rather than just talk.
Still, Gingrich has found an easy connection with audiences in almost every setting.
With the penny-loafer set, he can name-drop Strom Thurmond, as he has done several times, and talk about Presbyterian College in Clinton, S.C., where one of his daughters went to school.
At a stop in Rock Hill, he asked that all of the young people in the crowd come up onstage to prove a point about the burdens of mounting debt for the next generation.
But he had another point.
"This is a little like church," he said, as the crowd laughed in recognition.
With the pickup truck crowd, he can talk about hunting with some cultural authority, while admitting he's not much of a hunter.
"This is my brother Randy, from a hunting and fishing background. Randy has a particular relevance first because he is the leading hunter in the family, many of you who like to hunt, he'll be glad to chat with you later on and compare notes," he said at a stop in rural Walterboro. "For any of you who like the Second Amendment and like to talk about firearms, he's great."
Then Gingrich went on to make an environmentalism argument about how hunters are "among our most passionate conservationists, because they are actually out in the woods."
While Romney has been a whirling dervish of handshakes and smiles on the stump, often standing next to top surrogate South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley onstage and pointing to people in the crowd, Gingrich brings a steady ease.
Even in potentially uncomfortable settings.
Last week, Gingrich appeared at Jones Memorial AME church, where he faced a steady stream of questions about comments he made about blacks and welfare.
Again, he mentioned Thurmond, but he also talked about his work with Al Sharpton and also mentioned Donna Brazile.
And even though the questions were tough, there was a familiarity.
"How you doin', Newt?" E.T. Williams said, just before a tough question on Gingrich's comments about child janitors.
Later, Williams had another question.
"It's me again, Newt," he said, launching into a plea for Gingrich to get off of Obama's back.
Gingrich responded with ease and a compliment.
"I think you just gave the best case for Obama he's going to get," he said. "If I were him, I'd take that statement and turn it into a campaign commercial."
By the time it was over, he was enveloped in a prayer circle, then made his way to the church basement where he shook more hands over a chicken dinner.
In this latest stretch of campaigning, Gingrich, who has been dogged by questions about his personal life, could win based on his personal background, an argument that he is increasingly eager to make.
"I do believe that a solid Georgia Conservative is a lot more likely to debate and defeat Barack Obama than a Massachusetts moderate," he said.

France ponders Afghan pullout

BYLINE: Edward Cody;Kevin Sieff

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A01

LENGTH: 1102 words

DATELINE: PARIS

PARIS - France threatened Friday to unilaterally speed withdrawal of its troops from Afghanistan, underlining growing doubts about coalition unity in theU.S.-led effort to leave behind a lasting government in Kabul after more than a decade of war.
President Nicolas Sarkozy and key members of his government made the threat in a burst of anger over the killings of four French soldiers and the wounding of more than a dozen by a renegade Afghan soldier who turned an automatic rifle on his trainers Friday morning at a mountaintop base northeast of Kabul.  
The attack, coming after a similar shooting less than a month ago, sabotaged confidence here in the training and transition effort that has become the top focus of U.S. and allied troops.
"We are friends of the Afghan people, allies of the Afghan people," said a visibly upset Sarkozy. "But I cannot accept that Afghan soldiers fire on French soldiers."
A precipitous pullout by any of the major members of the U.S.-led coalition would undermine the withdrawal plan NATO agreed to in November 2010 and increase domestic pressure on President Obama to speed the drawdown of U.S. troops.
International concern over the Afghan mission has grown amid repeated instances in which Afghan troops - infiltrated Taliban extremists or individuals with a score to settle - have shot weapons or exploded bombs in attacks designed to kill and wound NATO forces. A report commissioned by the U.S. military said at least 58 Western military personnel were killed in 26 attacks by Afghan soldiers or police between May 2007 and May 2011, when the report was finished.
"Such fratricide is fast leading to a crisis of trust between the two forces, if it hasn't reached this point already," the report concluded. Its author, Jeffrey Bordin, wrote that the attacks "do not represent 'rare and isolated events' as currently being proclaimed."
Bordin's study suggested that personal clashes and insurgent infiltration threaten one of the conflict's most important relationships - that between Western troops and the Afghans, who in two years will take over combat operations as well as the war's sprawling architecture. 
The report mentions Afghan complaints about bullying, arrogance and an unwillingness to listen as creating dangerous animosity between the forces. The Wall Street Journal first reported on the study's findings in June.
Military officials acknowledge that the relationship between NATO and Afghan forces varies across provinces and units, and they have suggested that attempts to characterize the overall relationship as troubled or tense are reductive and inaccurate. Officials say the study is not indicative of a widespread threat to the war effort. 
But as attacks against foreign trainers have increased, the United States has committed to training a force of Afghan counterintelligence agents to keep insurgents out of the military and police.
Amid concerns by some in NATO that members would begin to make plans to leave Afghanistan, the alliance agreed at its last summit, 14 months ago in Lisbon, to gradually withdraw coalition combat troops by the end of 2014. 
The date certain - four years away when it was set - was designed to head off domestic pressure across Europe for ending involvement in the coalition.
It was thought that the timetable would allow sufficient training of Afghan troops to take over security tasks, improvement in Afghan governance and progress in negotiations with the Taliban to end the war.
Over the past year, however, the Obama administration has felt the most pressure to front-load the plan by withdrawing the bulk of its troops sooner rather than later. Alliance members plan to discuss the pace of the drawdown at NATO's next summit, in Chicago in May.
Sarkozy, speaking Friday to foreign diplomats, said all French training and other aid operations were being suspended immediately while France's deployment is reviewed.
Although the French role in Afghanistan has often been criticized domestically - particularly since Sarkozy relaxed rules limiting exposure to combat - it has never been seriously brought into question in Parliament.
But Sarkozy has moved into campaign mode, running for reelection in a two-round vote scheduled for April 22 and May 6. Any suggestion that he is not vigorously protecting French troops abroad could be disastrous for his hopes of a second term.
Sarkozy's main opponent in the election, Francois Hollande of the Socialist Party, reacted to the killings Friday by announcing that, if elected, he would bring French soldiers home from Afghanistan "as fast as possible, at the latest by the end of 2012." 
"This operation has gone on long enough," he said.
About 400 French soldiers were pulled out of Afghanistan in October, leaving an estimated 3,600 in the country. Friday's statement by Sarkozy is likely to reopen doubts about the depth of commitment to Afghanistan in Europe, where the war has long been unpopular and where leaders have been increasingly reluctant to put their troops in harm's way. 
Some European allies have also expressed concern about the long-term cost of maintaining Afghanistan's security forces, estimated at between $4 billion and $6 billion a year beyond 2014. 
The shootings Friday were the second such attack on French troops in less than a month. Two French Foreign Legion members were shot and killed Dec. 29 by an Afghan soldier in mountainous Kapisa province, which is France's main area of responsibility. Kapisa is a relatively peaceful zone, but it includes key infiltration routes used by the Taliban to move fighters and supplies from havens across the border in Pakistan.
Friday's shootings occurred in the same general area. The French soldiers were finishing a workout on an Afghan-commanded base when they were joined by an Afghan army contingent that was to accompany them on a training patrol later in the day, according to reports in Paris. As a result, they were not armed or able to defend themselves, French officials said.
The killings came on the same day that new details emerged about a helicopter crash  Thursday in the southern province of Helmand, which claimed the lives of six U.S. Marines. The cause was under investigation Friday, but U.S. officials said insurgent fire did not appear to be involved.

Innovative reggae musician, producer

BYLINE: Howard Campbell

SECTION: METRO; Pg. C06

LENGTH: 304 words

Winston Riley, 65, an innovative reggae musician and producer, died Jan. 19 at a hospital in Kingston, Jamaica. 
He had been hospitalized since November, when he was shot in the head at his house in an upscale Kingston neighborhood, his son Kurt Riley told the Associated Press. 
Mr. Riley was also shot in August, and he was stabbed in September 2011. His record store in Kingston's downtown business district was burned down several years ago. Police have said they know of no motives for the attacks and have made no arrests.
Kurt Riley told the Jamaica Observer newspaper that the family also did not know what motivated the attacks.
 "Unfortunately, Daddy didn't wake up so we could talk to him to find out if there was something he was not telling us," Kurt Riley was quoted as saying. "He was a straightforward man who was allergic to hypocrisy."
As a teenager, Mr. Riley founded the Techniques, an influential harmony group that recorded for pioneer producer Arthur "Duke" Reid. Mr. Riley also toured with Byron Lee and later gained fame for producing songs such as "Double Barrel" by Dave Barker and Ansell Collins.
The musicians he worked with included Gregory Isaacs, Johnny Osbourne, Sister Nancy and Buju Banton.
Musicologist Kingsley Goodison, who knew Mr. Riley for more than 40 years, said he was one of the people responsible for introducing reggae to England.
"Winston Riley is an unsung hero," he said. "He was one of the hardest workers in the business."
Mr. Riley also was credited with creating the stalag rhythm, which later influenced hip-hop and the dancehall style of Jamaican popular music.
Mr. Riley embraced contemporary reggae and had several big hits during the 1980s.
One of his biggest productions was singer Tenor Saw's "Ring the Alarm," which has been sampled by several hip-hop artists.

Fulham's Dempsey notches hat trick

BYLINE: Associated Press

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. D07

LENGTH: 379 words

Clint Dempsey became the first American to score a hat trick in England's Premier League, helping Fulham rally from a halftime deficit to rout Newcastle, 5-2, on Saturday. 
Dempsey put Fulham ahead 2-1 in the 59th minute with his 50th goal for the Cottagers, bundling in from three yards after Bobby Zamora's shot rebounded off goalkeeper Tim Krul.
He got his second in the 65th, slotting in a right-footed from 10 yards from Zamora's pass on a counterattack. Dempsey completed the scoring from Zamora's looping through pass in the 89th, splitting two defenders, heading the ball down to himself and taking two touches before a right-footed shot from 12 yards.
"We never found our rhythm in the first half but we began to get into their penalty area in the second half," Dempsey said. "Luckily the ball kept going in."

Krieger suffers knee injury
The U.S. women's soccer team lost a valuable piece Saturday when defender Ali Krieger (Forest Park) had torn knee ligaments diagnosed, likely ruling her out for the London Olympics.
Krieger tore the anterior cruciate and medial collateral ligaments in her right knee during Friday night's 14-0 win over the Dominican Republic in a qualifying match in Vancouver, B.C. The injury requires six to eight months of rehabilitation, a timetable that does not bode well for the Olympics that begin in July.
Krieger, 27, was injured when she was struck flush in her plant leg by Dominican midfielder Leonela Mojica while attempting a shot in the 40th minute.
"I feel so unfortunate and I wouldn't wish this on anyone, especially to have it happen in a match where we were in control," Krieger said in a statement. "Soccer is a funny game and this is part of being an athlete. It's unfortunate that the timing is really bad, but this team is about way more than one player."

U.S. men beat Venezuela
Ricardo Clark headed Jermaine Jones's corner kick into the net in the seventh minute of stoppage time and the United States beat Venezuela, 1-0, in a friendly on Saturday night in Glendale, Ariz. The U.S. had dominated play with nothing to show for it before Clark, who entered in the 86th minute, beat goalkeeper Jose Morales for his third international goal. The first match between the countries in five years featured the "B'' teams of both nations.

Four Iraqi soldiers killed in Fallujah

DATELINE: BAGHDAD

BAGHDAD - Gunmen armed with AK-47 assault rifles opened fire at an army checkpoint in the western Iraqi city of Fallujah on Saturday, killing four soldiers, according to a security official. 
The attack in the center of the city followed an assault six days earlier in nearby Ramadi, http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/insurgents-storm-police-station-in-western-iraq-21-dead/2012/01/15/gIQAkqRn0P_story.htmlwhere insurgents tried to blast their way into a police compound, setting off a deadly firefight with local authorities. After that clash, a police official warned that insurgents might soon target Fallujah.
On Saturday, about 7 p.m. local time, insurgents drove up to the Fallujah checkpoint in a four-wheel-drive vehicle, said Lt. Col. Najim al-Dulaimi, a spokesman for Anbar province's operations command.
Witnesses said the gunmen got out of the vehicle before opening fire. They shot two soldiers sitting in the back seat of a Humvee and two soldiers standing outside it,  the witnesses said. Dulaimi confirmed that four solders were killed.
The attack Saturday followed a wave of bombings that occurred over the past month in the wake of the U.S. troop departure and amid a paralyzing political crisis. The major attacks began in Baghdad on Dec. 22 in various Shiite and Sunni neighborhoods and commercial areas. Then Shiite pilgrims were struck as they walked to religious shrines south of Baghdad. Ramadi and Fallujah, the sites of the latest attacks, are in Sunni-dominated Anbar. 
Officials in Iraq and Washington worry that insurgents are trying to provoke reactions from both Shiite and Sunni militias that could trigger bloody and disruptive sectarian battles across the country. 
Also Saturday, an explosion occurred next to a military patrol just south of the city of Tikrit, injuring two soldiers, according to the al-Baghdadia TV channel's news Web site. Farther north, in Kirkuk, gunmen killed a civilian and wounded a police officer, al-Baghdadia reported.

Uncertain respite for one town in Syria

BYLINE: Liz Sly

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A01

LENGTH: 1144 words

DATELINE: ZABADANI, SYRIA

ZABADANI, Syria - The residents of this pretty mountain resort town still seem dazed with disbelief that they have somehow succeeded in driving out the Syrian army, 10 months after they first rose up to demand change.
It was here that the government led by President Bashar al-Assad made what appeared to be a startling concession Wednesday. After negotiating with the town's elders, the army agreed to withdraw from Zabadani, as well as from the adjoining town of Madaya, leaving a swath of territory effectively, if precariously, in the hands of the protest movement and rebel soldiers fighting in the name of the Free Syrian Army.
Quite how or why it happened - and whether the calm that has descended will last - are matters of debate. Some here credit the fight put up by the rebels, while others say that an Arab League mission to monitor the violence appears to have pressured a previously unrelenting government into backing down.
Zabadani is by no means the first town in Syria where protesters and residents have effectively seized control. But it is perhaps the only one where the government has been obliged to observe a cease-fire, giving the residents respite from what they said were daily shooting and artillery attacks, and raids in which activists were detained. 
During a visit Saturday by some of the Arab League monitors, residents could not hide their joy that Zabadani has, at least for now, become what they are hailing as a "liberated city," the first since the armed rebel force began taking shape in the fall.
"It's similar to Benghazi," said Suleiman Tinawi, a sergeant who defected from the army and joined the rebels eight months ago, reflecting a widely held hope that Zabadani will serve a role similar to that of the eastern Libyan city from which rebels launched the war that toppled Moammar Gaddafi, with the help of NATO air support.
"But it's not the same," he said. "We can't get weapons, and we don't have help. We need a no-fly zone."
The monitors' visit offered a rare glimpse into the increasingly turbulent Syrian uprising, which is already evolving into an armed insurgency that many fear could spin out of control and become a full-blown civil war. On Saturday, there were reports of fierce clashes between rebel soldiers and army loyalists in the Damascus suburb of Douma, which hugs the edge of the capital. The official Syrian news agency SANA reported that 14 people had been killed when explosions struck a convoy carrying prisoners in the restive northwestern province of Idlib.
Activist groups said that about 60 bodies bearing marks of torture had been discovered in a hospital mortuary in Idlib, which borders Turkey and has emerged as a rebel stronghold. Videos posted on YouTube showed rows of disfigured, bloodied corpses, but who they were and how they died was unclear. Twenty others were killed in protests and clashes around the country, activists said.
Zabadani is just 20 miles outside Damascus, which has so far remained mostly untouched by the protests roiling the country elsewhere, making its fall into rebel hands all the more striking. In calmer days, it was a popular summer destination for tourists from the Persian Gulf, who came to enjoy its cool climate and striking scenery.
Now, against a backdrop of snowcapped mountains, rebel soldiers of the Free Syrian Army wander in the streets alongside activists and protest leaders who previously dared make contact with the outside world only via secure Internet connections.
They talked about their hopes for freedom, their determination to overthrow the government and their yearning for international help. No guns were on display during the monitors' visit, but defected soldiers and activists readily admit that they are armed and fighting.
"The people and the Free Syrian Army have become one hand," said Amjad Khan, 31, who showed the monitors the damage inflicted on his home by an artillery shell fired by regular army soldiers days before the cease-fire was announced. "They are cooperating together."
At an abandoned Syrian checkpoint strewn with shell casings, a resident pleaded with the monitors to ask the Arab League to send weapons.
"Each one of us who has a weapon is going out to defend our homes, and if we had enough weapons we could do more," he said. The monitors took notes.

Liberated but under siege
The survival of this oasis remains in doubt, however. The army retreated about five miles but is still ringing the town. The mountainous terrain appears to give the advantage to a guerrilla force that clearly has the support of the local populace. But the residents are almost completely cut off from the outside world, unable to travel even to nearby Damascus to buy provisions.
"We are liberated, but we are under siege," local activist Anas Burhan said. He suspects that the government agreed to the cease-fire only to mollify the Arab League, which is meeting Sunday to decide whether to renew the monitors' mission for another month.
The Syrian opposition wants the league to refer the crisis to the United Nations, to secure a tougher international response to the Syrian government's crackdown, something Damascus is anxious to avoid.
"After Sunday, they will start bombing again to regain their reputation," Burhan said. "They only pulled out their tanks and hid them because of the Arab League."
"They may start bombing us as soon as you leave," added a farmer named Mohammed, who fretted that he had enough food stored away to last only another two months.

Sectarian suspicions
Yet the visit of the monitors suggested that the Arab League mission is making a difference, if only by illuminating at least some of the events that have been unfolding over the past 10 months almost entirely out of sight of the world.
Mothers approached the monitors with the names of missing sons, activists told of the abuses they suffered in detention, and people showed the damage done to their homes.
"This was the work of Hezbollah, Iran and the Shiites!" screamed a woman at a gracious villa high in the hills above town, pointing to wrecked furniture, broken crockery and smashed glass left behind by army soldiers who had used it as a base for shelling before they pulled out. Everyone in mostly Sunni Zabadani believes the Shiite Lebanese Hezbollah militia, which controls territory just across the border in Lebanon, is helping the government, and sentiments run high against Assad's Shiite-affiliated Alawite sect, to which many officers in the security forces belong.
The monitors took more notes. Then they jumped back into their black Mercedes-Benz and headed out of town to meet their government security escort for the ride back to Damascus.

Pulling the curtain on war mural's past

BYLINE: John Kelly

SECTION: METRO; Pg. C03

LENGTH: 712 words

The State Department's Truman Building was actually the Defense Department's pre-Pentagon headquarters. When State took over, it found a huge, warlike mural covering most of the wall that its diplomats and their striped-pants visitors faced as they entered the building. State hung a long stretch of fabric over the mural. I have two questions: Is the mural still there? If not, what happened to it?
- Wes Pedersen, Chevy Chase 
Yes, the mural is still there. In fact, it was recently spiffed up. Before we get to that, though, let's look at how it was created in the first place.
In 1941, a five-man, blue-ribbon jury announced that a 40-year-old design professor from Carnegie Tech - today's Carnegie Mellon University - had been selected to create the mural that would grace the new War Department Building at 21st Street and Virginia Avenue NW in Foggy Bottom.
The winner was a Texan named Kindred McLeary. Although he had trained as an architect, McLeary had always been interested in painting. In his home state, he became famous - and a bit notorious - in 1928, when, as a 26-year-old University of Texas architecture professor, he entered a respected San Antonio art contest.
His entry was called "Cotton." It was a painting of African American field hands after a day of work, and at the edge of the frame, it featured a naked woman reclining like an odalisque. Eloise Polk McGill, an art league officer and artist in the exhibition, called it "sexually vulgar." "It is most obscene and it repels," charged another artist. Others, including the director of art instruction for San Antonio's public schools, came to the painting's defense.
The San Antonio Express printed "Cotton" on its front page, letting readers judge for themselves (and doubtless selling a few papers in the process). In the end, the painting stayed.
McLeary is best known for his murals in U.S. libraries and post offices, part of the great heroic mural explosion across the country during the Depression, many the result of Works Progress Administration projects.
The War Department mural - 12 feet high, 50 feet long and budgeted at $11,000 - was completed in 1942. It was called "Defense of Human Freedoms," although Answer Man has seen it referred to as "America the Mighty."
Here's how The Washington Post described the work when McLeary was announced as the winner: "At either end of the mural McLeary depicts the horrors of war - guns blazing, incendiary bombs falling, soldiers in action, fallen civilians. The central portion is devoted to the virtues of a peacetime democracy."
At the mural's dedication, The Post said of the work: "It contemplates war simply as a means of preserving liberty."
In 1947, the War Department left the building for the Pentagon. The mural stayed. It was problematical. While its central portion shows Americans enjoying their freedoms - voting, worshiping, putting out a newspaper - there's no denying the rather martial aspects of the rest of the work. There are civilians surrounded by fire, soldiers in gas masks, the nose cones of bombers and the barrels of artillery.
In 1954, the mural was decreed "inappropriate" and covered with plywood, and that was covered with drapery.
"We thought of it as a sort of secret weapon," a Foreign Service officer told The Post's Paul Richard. "If diplomacy failed, we could always pull the curtain."
That finally happened in 1977: The curtain pulled, not the failure of diplomacy. The painting was uncovered and restored. Holes left by the plywood were repaired. Cracks from changes in humidity and temperature were filled in. Bare spots were dabbed with paint.
Unfortunately, the restoration techniques of 1977 were not as advanced as they are today. Oil paint was used over McLeary's original water-based pigments, doing more harm than good. In 2010, conservators from Great Falls-based Olin Conservation re-restored it using modern methods. It now gleams just inside what is called the 21st Street entrance.
McLeary didn't live to see the controversy that erupted over his mural. On May 29, 1949, the artist went up on the roof of his Pennsylvania home to sweep away the leaves. He fell, broke his neck and died. He was 47.

Methamphetamine abuse blamed for psychosis-fueled crimes

BYLINE: Gosia Wozniacka;Tracie Cone

DATELINE: FRESNO, CALIF.

FRESNO, Calif. - When a 23-year-old Fresno woman fatally shot her two toddlers and a cousin, critically wounded her husband, and then turned the gun on herself last Sunday, investigators immediately suspected methamphetamine abuse in what otherwise was inexplicable carnage. It turned out the mother had videotaped herself smoking meth hours before the shooting.
In family photos, the children are adorable, the mother pretty. They lived in a large apartment complex near a freeway with neatly clipped lawns and mature trees. The father was recently laid off from a packing house job. 
"When you get this type of tragedy, it's not a surprise that drugs were involved," said Lt. Mark Salazar, the Fresno Police Department's homicide commander. "Meth has been a factor in other violent crimes."
A Bakersfield mother was sentenced Tuesday for stabbing her newborn while in a meth rage. An Oklahoma woman drowned her baby in a washing machine in November. A New Mexico woman claiming to be God stabbed her son with a screwdriver last month, saying, "God wants him dead."

No limits to violence
"Once people who are on meth become psychotic, they are very dangerous," said Alex Stalcup, a doctor who treated Haight Ashbury heroin users in the 1960s, but now researches meth and works with addicts in the San Francisco Bay Area suburbs. "They're completely bonkers; they're nuts. We're talking about very extreme alterations of normal brain function. Once someone becomes triggered to violence, there aren't any limits or boundaries."
The Central Valley of California is a hub of the nation's methamphetamine distribution network, making extremely pure forms of the drug easily available locally. And law enforcement officials say widespread meth abuse is believed to be driving much of the crime in the vast farming region.
Chronic use of the harsh chemical compound known as speed or crank can lead to psychosis, which includes hearing voices and experiencing hallucinations. The stimulant effect of meth is up to 50 times longer than cocaine, experts say, so users stay awake for days on end, impairing cognitive function and contributing to extreme paranoia.
"Your children and your spouse become your worst enemy, and you truly believe they are after you," said Bob Pennal, a recently retired meth investigator from the California Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement.
Methamphetamine originally took root in California's agricultural heartland in the late 1980s and early '90s as a poor man's cocaine. Its use initially creates feelings of euphoria and invincibility, but experts say repeated abuse can alter brain chemistry and sometimes cause schizophrenia-like behavior.
Meth's availability and its potential for abuse combine to create the biggest drug threat in the Central Valley, a new report from the U.S. Department of Justice's Drug Intelligence Center says. From 2009 to 2010, methamphetamine busts in the Central Valley more than tripled, to more than 2,400 pounds, the report says.
Large tracts of farmland with isolated outbuildings are an ideal place to avoid detection, which is why the region is home to nearly all of the nation's "super labs," controlled by Mexican drug trafficking organizations, said John Donnelly, resident agent in charge of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration office in Fresno.
"They have the potential to make 150 pounds per [each] cook," he said. "There are more super labs in California than anywhere else. Every week another office calls us - St. Paul, Dayton, Kansas, Texas - and says, 'We've got a meth case here' and they say the suspects are from Turlock or Visalia. We're slinging it all over the country from here."
Last month, a drug task force working in four central California counties busted 24 alleged members of the Mexican drug cartel La Familia Michoacana with 14 pounds of powdered meth, 30 gallons of meth solution, 17 guns, $110,000 in cash and a fleet of vehicles with sophisticated hidden compartments for smuggling.
Most law enforcement agencies don't keep statistics on how many homicides, burglaries and thefts are meth-related, but those responding to the National Drug Intelligence Center's 2011 survey said the drug is the top contributor to violent crimes and thefts.
"It drives more crime than other drugs do. . . . It's so much more addictive than other drugs," Fresno County Sheriff Margaret Mims said.
Across the valley, meth addicts steal any metal they can resell - agricultural plumbing, copper wiring, lawn sprinklers.
"We lose five to 10 manhole covers a week," said Ceres Police Chief Art de Werk, who said a woman was injured recently when she fell into an unprotected drain in a shopping center. "Meth is the poor man's drug and frankly the Central Valley is an impoverished geographic area."

'Shake and Bake'
Authorities say the science involved in creating the chemical compound continues to evolve, including an easier recipe called "Shake and Bake" that is available on the Internet. Last month, an Oklahoma woman was arrested as she walked around a Wal-Mart store - for six hours before she was noticed - mixing ingredients for Shake and Bake.
In one of the recent attacks by meth users, Aubrey Ragina Mailloux received a nine-month sentence in Bakersfield on Tuesday for stabbing her 6-week-old infant in the back and cutting her along her abdomen, jaw and neck during a meth binge. The baby survived.
"It's not illegal because we don't want people to feel better. It's illegal because It makes good people do crazy things," said Mailloux's defense attorney, Mark Anthony Raimondo.
In Oklahoma, authorities charged Lyndsey Fiddler with second-degree manslaughter after an aunt found her infant daughter in a washing machine thudding off balance in the spin cycle. The aunt told authorities that Fiddler had been up for three days using meth.
In Albuquerque last month, Liehsa Henderson, high on meth, claimed to be God and told police God wanted her son to die after she allegedly stabbed him in the neck with a screwdriver. The boy survived.
Last Sunday, Fresno police found Aide Mendez dead on her bathroom floor. Her children - 17-month-old Aliyah Echevarria and Isaiah Echevarria, 3 - were in the bathtub. Mendez's cousin was dead in the kitchen. She had shot each in the head. The children's father remains hospitalized with stabbing and gunshot wounds.
Police recovered 10 grams of meth, $8,000 and the iPad the young mother used to videotape herself smoking the drug.

THE DISTRICT

Murder conviction for shooting witness
A District man was convicted of first-degree murder for shooting a government witness, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington announced.
Anthony Waters, 44, of Southeast, faces a life sentence without parole in the death of Derrick Harris, 37, also of Southeast, who was shot once in the head and five times in the back. 
The June shooting, according to prosecutors, had its roots in a 1998 incident when Harris testified in a murder trial in Barry Farms. Harris and Waters were part of a crew from the area, prosecutors said.
Harris's testimony caused him to be shunned and eventually provoked an argument and fistfight with Waters in June, prosecutors said. Waters threatened to kill Harris after the fight and made good on the threat by lying in wait and shooting Harris that night, the jury concluded Friday.

VIRGINIA

Roadways' names could be up for sale
Have you always wanted to see your name prominently displayed? Here's your chance.
Virginia Gov. Robert F. McDonnell (R) unveiled the more modest, second part of his transportation plan Friday, which includes selling naming rights to roads and bridges.
The proposal would allow names to be placed on the state's bridges, highways, interchanges and other infrastructure for an annual fee, which would go to the state's highway maintenance and operating fund. The fees would be set by a later vote.
The plan also authorizes the creation of the Virginia Toll Road Authority to construct, maintain and operate toll roads.
Toll facilities currently operated by the state could be transferred to the authority.
The proposal requires the approval of the General Assembly.
"Virginia simply cannot remain a leader in economic development and job creation if we do not continue to address our transportation challenge,'' McDonnell said in a statement.

The handgun that shot to the top

As you pass through airport security, graphics depict items prohibited in your carry-on luggage. While the representations of a knife and an aerosol spray can are fairly generic, the pictograph of a handgun is unequivocally the silhouette of a Glock pistol.
In 1982, an obscure http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/longterm/dcpolice/deadlyforce/police4_glockside.htm"                 title="www.washingtonpost.com-URL-Austrian engineer named Gaston Glock, who worked in a radiator plant and had a side business with his wife making curtain rods, knives and belt buckles,   invented a type of pistol that   changed the worlds of law enforcement and firearms and powerfully influenced politics and popular culture. Glock is now 82, and his surname has become synonymous in some circles with "handgun." 
Less than three decades ago, few had heard of Glock, the man or the gun. Just how a pistol developed by an unknown engineer with little firearms experience became the dominant, if not iconic, law enforcement handgun in the United States is the subject of Paul M. Barrett's "http://www.amazon.com/dp/0307719936/ref=as_li_tf_til?tag=washpost-books-20&camp=0&creative=0&linkCode=as1&creativeASIN=0307719936&adid=0ZGH4ATC7CM5B8TGESXW-URL-Glock."
Thirty years ago, Glock knew that the Austrian army wanted 20,000 new service pistols made in Austria, and no suitable gun existed. So he set out to design one. As former Austrian Lt. Ingo Wieser, who tested the new pistol in 1983 for the military, put it: "Mr. Glock was at the right place at the right time."
The all-black pistol had unconventional lines, sleek simplicity and extreme reliability - and its   adoption shocked the firearms industry.
In designing the gun, Glock started with no preconceived notions - just a clean sheet of paper, a practical idea, good advice, sound engineering and no investment in any particular manufacturing method. When he received the contract, his workspace was the garage where he made his knives.
He had a gift for blending plastic and metal. By mating polymer and machined steel components, he was able to manufacture his pistol at an extremely competitive price. His process gave his fledgling company a profit margin of, at times, an estimated 70 percent, considerably higher than his competitors'.
Although he had the Austrian military contract, Glock had little in the way of a business plan. "Where there really is money to be made is to convert U.S. police departments from revolvers to pistols," Karl Walter, who soon became an executive with the Glock firm, told the inventor in an early meeting.
Then, on April 11, 1986, a watershed event occurred: the "Miami Massacre," in which a pair of   armed robbers killed two FBI agents and wounded five more. The bloodshed demonstrated to U.S. law enforcement that officers needed more firepower. The Glock offered the high-magazine capacity police craved (17 rounds) as well as an often overlooked advantage: Officers could be easily trained in its use.
The revolvers typically used by American police for decades had a cylinder capacity of six rounds, and officers were trained to fire them double-action, meaning one long, heavy trigger pull would cock the hammer and then release it to travel forward and fire a cartridge. The Glock trigger - just point and pull - operated much like that of the double-action revolvers, a concept law enforcement embraced, but the trigger pull was lighter weight and of shorter length. The pistol was also easy to clean and maintain.
The rise of the man and his gun, as ably reported by Barrett, is a story of innovation, manufacturing, marketing, money, lawsuits, power, influence, politics and a little sex. Barrett does an admirable job of describing the Glock's cultural and corporate ascendancy. He also explains how the company was able to remain profitable despite allegations of corruption, tax avoidance and malfeasance.   A seasoned reporter and now assistant managing editor of Bloomberg Businessweek, Barrett originally covered the more disturbing allegations of Glock's financial and managerial irregularities in a series of articles for the magazine.
As sales of the pistol took off, money flowed into Glock, lots of it, prompting one former employee who stole from the company to liken the cash to "Monopoly money." When Charles ג[#x2c6][#x161]Ewert, a former director of Glock GmbH and a corporate trustee, was about to be exposed for embezzling company funds in 1999ג[#x2c6][#x161], he hired a Belgian mercenary and professional wrestler to mash in Gaston Glock's skull with a rubber mallet in a Luxembourg parking garageג[#x2c6][#x161]. Then 70-year-old Glock, Despite taking sevenג[#x2c6][#x161] blows to the head, the 70-year-oldג[#x2c6][#x161] Glock put up the fight of his life and managed to render his would-be assassin unconscious before the police arrived.
Much of Barrett's information comes from court documents - including the attempted murder-for-hire attempt that landed bothresulted in Ewert and the wrestler in's jailing - and interviews with former company executives.
Barrett also reveals the depth of the http://www.washingtonpost.com/editorial-opinion/america-armed-and-dangerous/2011/01/10/ABG4GkD_story.html"                 title="www.washingtonpost.com-URL-Glock's impact on modern culture. Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre have rapped about Glocks; Hollywood has played up the gun in movies such ashttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O77SRM?ie=UTF8&tag=washpost-books-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B000O77SRM"                 title="www.amazon.com-URL-"Die Hard 2: Die Harder"andhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZG96ZC?ie=UTF8&tag=washpost-books-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B002ZG96ZC"                 title="www.amazon.com-URL-"Cop Out,"which was promoted with the tagline   "Rock out with your Glock out." Inhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0034G4P7G?ie=UTF8&tag=washpost-books-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B0034G4P7G"                 title="www.amazon.com-URL-"The Social Network," the gun is casually mentioned in conversation between Harvard students when one friend, embarrassed in front of Mark Zuckerberg, says to another: "If I had a Glock, I'd kill you."
The pistol is used competitively by world-champion shooters and defensively by honest citizens; it rides in the holster of two-thirds of American police officers, including FBI agents (they carry Glock 22s today). It has also been used to perpetrate heinous crimes by mass murderers such as George Hennard, Seung Hui Cho and Jared Lee Loughner.
Much of the Glock's success can be attributed not only to http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/longterm/dcpolice/deadlyforce/police4page2.htm"                 title="www.washingtonpost.com-URL-its sharp design, but also to political campaigns and media coverage focused on banning the pistol. Glocks have been on the front line of the http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/nation/guns/"                 title="www.washingtonpost.com-URL-gun-control debatessince they were first imported and dubbed "hijacker specials." (They have also been labeled "plastic pistols" and "pocket rockets.") It was feared that Libyan terrorists would smuggle them aboard airliners, taking advantage of the polymer frames, but it turns out that Glocks are just as easy to detect as other handguns.
Indeed, Glock's success is proof that any media coverage in the gun industry is good media coverage. Political heat and Hollywood's limelight helped propel the Austrian handgun from obscurity to curiosity to dominance.
While Barrett's deeming of the Glock as "America's gun" is uncomfortable for many firearms enthusiasts, the Glock is indisputably the most widely distributed pistol among http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/longterm/dcpolice/deadlyforce/police4page1.htm"                 title="www.washingtonpost.com-URL-American law enforcement today, and quite popular with sport shooters, too. While its octogenarian inventor has said he hopes to live to age 120, his pistol and its impact on our culture and society will inevitably outlast him.

back to me, content to answer an e-mail ,  while I sort through the pile.Once I finish untangling, I hold in my hands a curious plastic   sack,about 21 inches long and 18 inches wide. A bunched white elastic strip, reminiscent of a garter, circles the mouth at the open end. A thickplastic tube runs into the sack, stretching 37 inches before branchinginto a T-shape with 12-inch arms extending from each side of thejoint. ֲ¶   Egbert  calls it an "exit hood." It's a contraption that can end a lifein  minutes.  ֲ¶ The 84-year-old cq age? /cq  doctor, a retired anesthesiologist //repeats description above/sw//    who formerly served as a campus Unitarian Universalist minister ג[#x2c6][#x161]  and has taught as an assistant visiting professor ג[#x2c6][#x161]  at Johns Hopkins University ג[#x2c6][#x161] , offers to explain how it works.     The tube connects to two helium tanks, he says. He lifts the hood over his head and lowers the open end, letting go as the garter clamps to his forehead. Then, he says, you release the valves on the tanks, streaming helium into the hood.
"You fill it up until it feels like a New York chef's hat," he says, stretching the hood to demonstrate.  
Then, he says, you pull the hood down. And he does just that, easing it past his eyes, his nose, his chin, and cinching it even tighter at his neck with a sweatband. His face goes hazy behind the plastic, a blurry image of a man whose life and work is prone to distortions and intrigue. His breath fogs the plastic, but he holds the hood there for a moment, saying something that I can't quite make out.
Might he need saving?
Another breath. More fog. Even though there's no helium coursing into the hood, I'm anxious. Should I pull it away?
Another breath, and, finally, he lifts the hood. He inhales deeply and smiles.
"That's how it's done," he says matter-of-factly. 
In those final seconds before his patients lose consciousness and die, the words they utter sound like Donald Duck, he says, imitating the high-pitched, nasally squeak familiar to any child who has sucked a gulp from a helium balloon.
So, this is how a human being can leave this Earth? 
Sounding like Donald Duck?
Egbert estimates he has been present for 100 suicides in the past 15 years, a figure that puts him in the same league with the famed assisted-suicide maverickJack Kevorkian, who claimed to have helped more than 130 people die. Egbert calls Kevorkian a "radical" because the latter took an active role in some suicides, building a machine to administer lethal doses and sometimes injecting patients himself. Egbert sees his work as a calling, a vocation aimed at ending suffering. But he says he provides only guidance and support. 
Egbert says he approved applications for about 300 suicides, most  as medical director of the _blankFinal Exit Network, a loosely knit group that claims 3,000 dues-paying members. Even within his own organization, Egbert is controversial. The vast majority of the network's members suffer from painful physical ailments such as late-stage cancer, he says. But unlike the group's current leadership, Egbert is also willing, in extreme cases, he says, to serve as an "exit guide" for patients who have suffered from depression for extended periods of time.
At the same time that Egbert was guiding the people he refers to as his patients, Kevorkian was the embodiment of the national debate over assisted suicide, a figure of simultaneous international renown and scorn. But with Kevorkian gone - he died in Juneג[#x2c6][#x161] - two indictments of Egbert, one in Arizonaג[#x2c6][#x161] and another in Georgiaג[#x2c6][#x161], have transformed him into the public face of American assisted suicide, a practice as tangled in controversy as the contents of the bag I had just opened. It has been more than 17 14 cq no. of years? looks like it was adopted by voters 1994 acc to 11/13/94 twp story, which would be 18 years; but another twp story says it was enacted in 1997 (which would be 15) /fxyears since Oregon voters passed a ballot initiative approving the nation's first assisted-suicide law for terminally ill patients. since Oregonג[#x2c6][#x161] passed the nation's firstג[#x2c6][#x161] law allowing physician-assisted suicide. ג[#x2c6][#x161] Only one other state - Washingtonג[#x2c6][#x161]approved 2008 per nexis/ja - has legalized the procedure, and the American Medical Associationג[#x2c6][#x161] remains firmly opposed.ג[#x2c6][#x161] (Montana's Supreme Court issued a ruling in 2009ג[#x2c6][#x161] that essentially sanctioned assisted suicide, but the legislature hasn't formally passed a law,just want to cq /cq leaving the state in a legal limbo.)
Egbert has been acquitted in Arizona, but the Georgia case looms, trudging slowly through the court system toward a possible trial that could further shape national opinion about assisted suicide. Egbert lacks Kevorkian's public relations flair - he's not one to dress in costumes - and he lacks Kevorkian's certitude. I expect to find an absolutist, a proselytizer for a cause, when I first drive to Baltimore to meet Lawrence Egbert. Instead, I encounter a man whose zeal is tempered by self-doubt. 
"Once I am a true believer, that's the time I should quit," he says one afternoon. "I never get used to it. I'm not used to it now."
Egbert has worked with patients who used barbiturates or morphine to speed their deaths, but he says those treatments can be hard to acquire in the quantities necessary to end life. Helium, on the other hand, is easy to get. Final Exit's patients are instructed that they can buy helium tanks at party stores, Egbert tells me. Remnants of his clients' visits to party stores lie beneath the hoods, at the bottom of Egbert's garbage bag. Here is a pack of balloons. Pink, blue, yellow, green. 
For the hoods, Egbert's organization has recommended two suppliers: One sells a $60 hood with a "very adjustable 'sweatband' neck, considered superior to bags with Velcro necks," according to a script used by volunteer phone operators, known as "first responders." The other option is called an "Orchid Bag" and has an elastic neck.
Egbert tells me that years ago he asked someone who was about to "exit" if he could reuse the hood to save future patients the cost of buying a new one. The patient was delighted with the idea, Egbert says. He started asking everyone. 
The hood in my bare hands feels slightly slick. So, this one, the one I'm holding, has been used to end someone's life? I ask. Egbert tells me it has surely been used at least once, and maybe several times, and the same could be said for most of the other 17 hoods in the garbage bag. 
"Do you wash them?" I ask.
Egbert laughs.
"Nobody's ever asked me that," he says.
He considers this for a moment.
"If a person is going to die, what do they care?" he says. "They're not going to get infected."
He says patients lose consciousness within 30 to 60 seconds of pulling the hoods over their faces and are usually dead within five to 10 minutes. "They turn blue or bluish - we can say gray," Egbert says. "After they're unconscious, their muscles start twitching. That's very upsetting to relatives. Some think they're trying to wrench the bag off."
I ask Egbert how much helium it takes to kill a person. "I don't know," he says. He recommends buying 50-liter tanks. "I know we have two tanks, and we run them to zero. Until they stop hissing. ... It's better to have too much than too little."
I find myself staring at one of the hoods, turning it over and over, trying to comprehend how someone could spend the final moments of life with this thing over his head. I tell Egbert that the hoods make me feel uncomfortable.
He responds in a reed-thin voice, with the manner of a country doctor: "I hope so."
The newspaper story told of a death penalty case in Texas, but Egbert couldn't stop thinking about the people who were consulting with the executioners. They were doctors. Doctors like him.
For a man in his ninth decade of life, Egbert has a remarkable memory. The exact date of the execution is etched: Dec. 7, and the year, he says, was in the early 1980s.
Later, I look it up. Indeed, on Dec. 7, 1982, Texas executed a man named Charles Brooks Jr., who had been convicted of murdering a mechanic. It was the first execution  in the nation by lethal injection.
At the time, Egbert says, he was working as an anesthesiologist at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas, the same facility where President John F. Kennedy was taken on the day of his assassination. Egbert guided surgery patients from consciousness to unconsciousness and back again. "Anybody can put 'em down," Egbert tells me. "It's the skillful ones who can wake 'em up."
The death penalty left off that final stage - the reviving. "Why are doctors doing this crap?" he thought.
Later, a Unitarian minister asked whether Egbert would assist in the suicide of a terminally ill member of his congregation. Egbert's thoughts flipped back to the death penalty. Would he be like those doctors? Eventually, he concluded that assisting the ailing woman in committing suicide was a "humane" way to end suffering.
The woman's daughter ended up talking her out of it. But Egbert was sufficiently intrigued to join the Hemlock Society, an organization founded by journalist and author Derek Humphry, who would later write a huge bestseller, a suicide how-to guide called "Final Exit." (The Hemlock name would later be abandoned; some former members became part of a right-to-die advocacy organization called Compassion & Choices, while others, including Egbert, helped create the Final Exit Network in 2004 because they wanted to actively work with people who were contemplating suicide.) 
Egbert's first suicide case involved a successful businessman in suburban Philadelphia, he says, though he doesn't remember the exact date. Egbert rattled off instructions so quickly, he recalls, that the man told him, "Slow down! I've never done this before." 
"Well, it is a once-in-a-lifetime experience!" Egbert responded. They laughed so hard, Egbert says, that they alarmed the man's wife, who came running downstairs.
In the early days, Egbert says, he and other volunteers used a common supermarket "turkey bag," which had a tendency to fail on occasion. Once, he recalls, he was working with a woman who'd had two unsuccessful suicide attempts. The woman seemed to die but awoke a few minutes later. "You screwed up twice yourself - you call in the pros, and we couldn't do it either!" he told her. They patched a hole in the bag, and this time it worked.
Another time, he advised a patient who was using large quantities of morphine to down the pills with vodka. "I prefer chardonnay," she told him. He got her a glass.
As Egbert burrowed deeper into this world, he often thought of his father, Lawrence Egbert Sr.  Good-paying government jobs had allowed his father to provide a comfortable home in Chevy Chase, where Egbert grew up among the region's privileged classes. But his father's sunny demeanor was changed by his experiences on the military prosecution team at the Nuremberg trials of Nazi war criminals.
The senior Egbert, an Army lieutenant colonel  who later was an editor of the official trial record, would sit in the back yard staring blankly after returning from Europe. He was haunted by the testimony and his inspections of death camps.
The father's experiences prompted the son's curiosity. The younger Egbert fixated on the appalling actions of Nazi doctors, especially the experiments they had conducted, such as immersing inmates in ice water or injecting them with poisons. 
"Most of them thought it was justified," Egbert says one afternoon. "Some of them were delighted by it." 
As he did with the death penalty doctors in Texas, Egbert weighed the choices that Nazi doctors made - choices that eventually led to unspeakable evils - against the choices he made. 
"It makes me suspicious of everything I do - that I might be doing something evil," he says. "I think about it a lot." 
He thinks of doctors consulting for executions, for instance, and imagines "a slippery slope." He also wonders whether his own work could nudge society toward something awful.
"I could be part of a slippery slope," he says, "to us becoming like Nazis - the Final Exit Network, and me as an individual."
STEVEN KAHN SEEMED like a perpetual-motion machine. He took up Rollerblading in his late 40s, recalls his wife, Merrily Kaplan. He swam and rode bikes. 
Then he started falling down. "A lot of people thought he was drunk," Kaplan recalls. "He was slurring his words." Eating became an exercise in choking and spitting.
What people didn't know was that Kahn, at 50, had received a diagnosis of    amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the degenerative disease that felled baseball legend Lou Gehrig.
As Kahn's illness progressed and one treatment after another failed,  he began to meticulously consider his options, Kaplan says. Doctors and hospice volunteers wanted to talk about managing his pain; he wanted to talk about ending it quickly.
Kahn, who had been an architect in New Haven, Conn., thought he could shoot himself or hang himself, Kaplan says. But then he realized he wouldn't have the strength to pull the trigger or knot the rope. He thought about crashing his car over a cliff, but he couldn't be sure he'd die, Kaplan says. For a time, they warmed to the idea of sleeping pills. Friends would call and say, "I saved three pills for you!" But they could never accumulate enough.
They found the Hemlock Society while doing research on the Internet, and that led them to Lawrence Egbert, whom Kaplan took to calling "The Man With the Hood." She was simultaneously comforted by him and ill at ease. "Do I make him tea?" Kaplan recalls telling a friend before his visit to her home on the Quinnipiac River. "What's the protocol? It was just bizarre."
Kahn wanted to die in a back room, where he had installed glass walls overlooking the river. They set a date with Egbert in March 2003. On the day of her husband's death, Kaplan served his favorite carrot cake. He couldn't eat it - he was being fed through a stomach tube. But he placed a bit to his lips so he could taste it.
Egbert arrived with a clergyman, and Kaplan stationed friends at the front and back doors to block visitors. Someone pulled the shades open, so Kahn could see the river one last time, Kaplan recalls.
Kahn "mostly" placed the hood on his head himself, she says. She doesn't remember who helped. She thinks he was able to turn the helium valves himself. As it began to flow, "he just kind of drifted," she says. "I remember feeling very proud. His eyelids kind of fluttered. He got kind of still."
There was one more thing she needed to do: "Cancel the chocolate pudding." A friend was going to bring some over that night for Kahn. He wouldn't need it now.
Kaplan, in effect, was the grieving but satisfied family member. Yet it wouldn't be long before Egbert began accumulating family members who felt aggrieved.
On Feb. 25, 2009, law enforcement agents climbed the stairs of Egbert's Baltimore office and placed him under arrest as part of a probe by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, or GBI, into the death of a 58-year-old man from Cumming, Ga., named John Celmer. The officers seized Egbert's computer and took files from a cabinet, he says. Curiously, the garbage bag full of exit hoods was left untouched. 
The arrests paralyzed the Final Exit Network. Exit guides, fearful of prosecution, began canceling suicides. A 60-year-old New Jersey woman who had joined the network in the latter stages of an incurable brain disease was furious about the halt of operations and committed suicide on her own using helium tanks and a hood, according to a report in the Philadelphia Inquirer.
Bank accounts containing more than $300,000 were seized by the GBI. The network's attorney, Robert Rivas, accuses state authorities of trying to bankrupt the network. But investigators bungled the seizure, failing to file a complaint required under racketeering laws, and a judge ordered the money returned. Forsyth County District Attorney Penny Penn  and a GBI spokesman declined to comment.
Three months after the arrests in the Georgia case, Egbert, who was free on bond, was indicted along with three others in an Arizona case, this one involving the 2007 suicide of a 58-year-old woman from Phoenix named Jana Van Voorhis. Her sister did not know about her plans and had complained to authorities. Egbert was not present for either the suicide in Georgia or the one in Arizona. But he's the common thread in the cases. Indeed, he's the common thread in the entire Final Exit Network, as  he was responsible for signing off on all suicides for the group. 
To be "guided" by the network, people who want to commit suicide are asked to apply for membership and pay annual dues of $50, which goes toward operating expenses such as travel. After a person joins, a "medical committee" decides whether the applicant is eligible, starting a process of consultations that can last years. The committee was supposed to have three members, but in reality Egbert was making most of the decisions on his own.
The Arizona case took two years. Two of Egbert's colleagues pleaded guilty to facilitating manslaughter and agreed to testify, but Egbert dug in. In April 2011, after a two-and-a-half-week trial, the jury acquitted Egbert of conspiracy to commit manslaughter.
The Georgia case, which centers on Celmer's death in June 2008, is moving more slowly. Celmer had discovered a lesion in his mouth in 2006 that was eventually diagnosed as cancer, his wife, Sue Celmer, said in an interview. The Celmers had lived separately for 10 years. But they occupied townhouses in the same development, and he remained on her health insurance policy, she said.
Chemotherapy swelled John Celmer's face, and his skin was forever hot, she said. His gum tissue deteriorated, exposing sharp bones that sliced his tongue; a hole the size of a quarter formed under his chin. 
In late May 2008, doctors rebuilt his jaw with bone from his calf. They shaved skin grafts from his chest and thigh, exposing raw, irritated flesh, she said. "He was a mess," she said. "He was furious."
Unbeknownst to his wife, John Celmer had already contacted the Final Exit Network by the time he underwent the surgery. Sue Celmer believes her husband didn't tell her what he was considering because he knew she would disapprove on religious grounds. According to legal documents, he had bought an exit hood from a small company in California called GLADD,  which stands for Good Life and Dignified Death. He had also bought helium tanks at a party store in Cumming, Ga.
At various times, Sue Celmer said, he was taking Chantix to try to quit smoking, and taking oxycodone or applying morphine patches to manage his constant pain. "Anybody who takes that many drugs is in no position to make decisions about their lives," she said. "He was like a drowning man, and they saw it as a grand opportunity to promote their agenda and drown him."
On June 19, 2008, Sue Celmer walked into her husband's home, as she often did, and found him lying in bed dead. The scene seemed staged, she thought.
She sifted through her husband's things and found literature from the Final Exit Network. She prayed, then she called the coroner. A postmortem examination showed that John Celmer was cancer-free at the time of his death, according to authorities.
The GBI took up the case and arranged a sting operation, contacting the Final Exit Network and assigning an agent to pose as someone who wanted to commit suicide during a meeting with two of the group's volunteers, Nicholas Sheridan and Claire Blehr. The volunteers allegedly showed the agent how they would hold down his hands so that he couldn't remove the hood while he was breathing in the helium, according to the GBI. The allegation, which the volunteers have denied, contradicts the Final Exit Network's claim that its volunteers do not actually "assist" in suicides, but merely provide information, guidance and companionship. Shortly after the sting, Egbert, Sheridan, Blehr and  Ted Goodwin (the group's president at the time) were all arrested on charges of assisting in a suicide, tampering with evidence and racketeering.
Since then, though, Sue Celmer suspects the Final Exit Network of playing a delay game and wonders why the prosecutors don't push ahead. She has already arrived at her verdict. "I call it murder," she said. "Hitler thought he was justified in killing people he didn't think should live. This is not a far stretch from that."
While waiting for the case to play out, Egbert has agreed not to attend suicides. He wouldn't talk about the cases, except to say one thing: "As far as I'm concerned, I'd do it again."
The Final Exit  Network is guiding people to their deaths again.Egbert is no longer the group's medical director. He hopes to resume working as an exit guide after the Georgia case. Volunteers say he'll find a changed organization, one that is more restrictive and less daring or, depending on one's perspective, less reckless.
"After the Arizona case, we began to stress [family notification] even more than we had been," says Wendell Stephenson, a Fresno City College philosophy instructor who recently became Final Exit Network's president. "The problem is that ultimately we have to respect the wishes of the individual who wants his life to end." 
Egbert has estimated that he approved 95 percent of applications. "His presumption is that they're going to be a good candidate," Rivas says of Egbert. "I don't think we have that presumption anymore." The group is also enforcing its requirement for a three-member medical committee, he says.
"The organization, by being tighter, is saying very clearly that they'd like to reduce the likelihood of this happening again - legal stuff happening again," Egbert says. I ask him if he considers the changes a direct criticism of him. "Definitely," he responds. "I was annoyed." 
Egbert is an original member of the network and remembers heated debates in 2004 when the group was formed at meetings in Chicago. Egbert participated by phone, arguing that they should take patients with long-term depression who did not respond to treatment. 
Earl Wettstein, an advertising executive who served as the network's first president, opposed because he thought taking depression cases would push "the envelope beyond our original intent. ... It was a matter of it was hard to diagnose, and, to me, it was not a terminal or life-ending condition." He lost the argument and resigned in protest.
With the imprimatur of the board, Egbert took the case of a depressed woman in the Midwest; he won't say exactly where to protect her anonymity. He went to her home with Jerry Dincin, a psychologist who later became president of Final Exit Network and confirmed the basic outline of the case as related by Egbert. (Dincin recently resigned as president because he suffers from terminal cancer. He has purchased helium and a hood, but said in an interview that he isn't sure whether he'll "be courageous enough" to use them.)
The woman was a 65-year-old teacher who had suffered from extreme bouts of depression since she was a teenager and was prone to violent outbursts. Still, "I had very lively mixed feelings, just looking at her," Egbert says. "Very attractive, very intelligent. A woman who could walk for miles - pretty much do anything."
He decided she qualified, though, because she had tried antidepressants and electroshock therapy without success. Egbert and Dincin rented a car and drove to her home. She put on a bathrobe and followed their instructions to sit with her head tilted slightly up. She released the valves, pulled the hood over her head and Egbert told her to "breathe normal."
"At that time I took her hand," Egbert says. "My colleague took her other hand." He was comforting her, not trying to stop her from removing the hood, he says.
When it was done, they collected the equipment and left. 
"We did her," Egbert recalls. "I can feel the discomfort [about making that decision] still."
HElium tanks and a hood wait in June Lennon's closet in Bayonne, N.J. Once, she came close, incredibly close, to using them.
June, now 46, suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, better known as COPD, and when the summer heat greets the pollutants from the factories near her home town, she says she can barely breathe. She has lost count of how many times she has been hospitalized or placed on a ventilator.
Asbestosis had taken her Uncle Walter. His face was grayish-blue the last time she saw him alive; his breaths, mere puffs. Emphysema got Uncle Al. Lung cancer snatched Great Aunt Eileen. But Mom, also named June Lennon, she was the worst. Six months on and off ventilators because of COPD. She gasped for breath to the end, which came in March 2005. 
Lennon fell into depression, then the summer arrived, and summers are always bad. Lennon, who works as a doctor's office administrator, decided death would be preferable. She searched the Internet for "painless suicide methods," or as she was thinking of it, "serene ways to do yourself in. Some were painless if you're a really good shot."
But shooting herself would be "messy," she says, and Lennon doesn't like messes. She knows a lot of cops, and she didn't want to leave them with such an image.
Her Internet search brought her to the Final Exit Network, and to Lawrence Egbert. Lennon says Egbert tried to talk her out of it but agreed to her request when he saw her struggle to walk up a set of stairs. And so it was that one day in 2005, not long after her mother died, Lennon scheduled her death as if it were an appointment at the dentist.
It might have happened if Egbert hadn't insisted on a friend being there. It was a guideline that he says he generally followed, though he sometimes made exceptions. Just before Lennon was to die, the friend she had chosen called to say she had gotten a great acting gig. "Darling," Lennon says her friend told her. "You're simply going to have to reschedule your death. I can't go on with that hanging over my head."
And so it was that Lennon canceled her own death. 
Still, Lennon likes keeping her helium tanks around. She figures she might use them someday. It's odd to hear her say this because she seems so utterly alive: funny, inquisitive, engaged in life. Our conversation at the bar at Hendrickson's Restaurant, her neighborhood hangout, is interrupted often by her buddies. "Miss June!" the bartender calls out. "Chuckie!" she says. "Chuckie-poo," she confides, "he knows my routine." A few minutes later, she's flagging down a young waiter. "Hello, angel. Hello, love. Did you start school again? Good luck to ya."
She's trying to lose weight. She looks healthy. How then could she be thinking about ending it all? Why not get rid of the tanks? She tells me things might look different - come summer.
Egbert can't find his wife, Ellen. He has been calling for the past two days since arriving at the annual general assembly of the Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations in Charlotte. 
"I'm assuming my wife's in jail," he tells me.
Just this morning, Egbert spotted a small newspaper article about antiwar protesters being arrested at the U.S. Capitol, and he assumes - correctly - that she is among them. She estimates she has been arrested almost 200 times. 
"An arrest is what drew us together," he says. They were demonstrating in Nevada against nuclear weapons. Egbert was 29 years her senior and married to his second wife when he took up with Ellen Barfield, who is now 55. math checks out/ja His wife found out and asked him to break it off, Egbert recalls, smiling. "We had a rational discussion about it," he says. "I was having such a good time I wasn't going to quit."
Egbert and Barfield moved in together in 1991, but just got around to getting married in 2010  when someone pointed out that she would receive Social Security benefits after his death if they were wed. One of Egbert's three great-grandchildren joined them to celebrate the nuptials, which they sealed at a Baltimore courthouse. Egbert also has five children and nine grandchildren. 
Being a doctor, Egbert lends special skills from time to time to Barfield's antiwar activism, her full-time vocation. Last year, he drew blood from his wife and one of her friends, who then sprinkled it on dollar bills. They yelled "Stop this war!" and tossed the blood-spattered bills into the aisle at a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee hearing just as Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) was about to speak.
Barfield might have accompanied Egbert to Charlotte if not for withdrawing from the Unitarians in a dispute over whether to condemn the Israelis for attacking a supply ship headed to Gaza.
Egbert almost didn't make it here, either.
After his arrest, even the Unitarians - certainly among the most amenable of religious organizations on the subject of assisted suicide - raised concerns about him and the Final Exit Network. The Rev. Sarah Lammert,ג[#x2c6][#x161] director of ministries and faith developmentג[#x2c6][#x161] for the Unitarian Universalist Association, questioned whether the Unitarians might seem to be endorsing the Final Exit Network by renting a booth to the group at the general assembly. "Do we lend them a higher level of credibility, and thus share any moral or ethical responsibility for their actions?" Lammert argued,where did she write this? fx according to an informational handouta recap of what? was this before or during this general assembly? or was it from a past general assembly or meeting?fx prepared by Egbert.
In a brief interview, Lammert says she raised concerns because she was "questioning whether they are capable of following through with their own standards." She had also cited a complaint by a member of a Florida congregation who claims a Final Exit Network volunteer counseled her father to commit suicide in a casual conversation at a coffeehouse - a claim disputed by the Final Exit Network. After the group's attorney sent her an "exhaustive list" of safeguards the group now uses, Lammert relented, and the Unitarians allowed Egbert and his colleagues to take part in what she called a "marketplace of ideas." 
Still, Egbert feels stung. At the assembly, he confronts Lammert as she leaves a panel discussion, jabbing his right index finger at her face. "You didn't do your homework!" he barks. 
Egbert, for all his self-doubt, relishes the chance to argue about his work. It's as if the process of arguing helps convince himself that he is doing right.
Another time, he is invited to debate a Catholic priest in front of public health students at Johns Hopkins University, his alma mater. In the days before, he pores over biblical texts, settling on the story of Saul, who is said to have fallen on his sword, committing suicide, after leading the Israelites into defeat during a battle against the Philistines. Saul's story, Egbert reasons, will help him argue that the Bible does not frown upon suicide.
The priest, the Rev. David Mott of the Church of Sts. Philip & James  in Baltimore, argues that only a depressed person would commit suicide. Mott tells the audience that there is a Catholic tradition of caring for the sick and dying as an act of "mercy, like feeding the hungry and visiting the imprisoned."
"From the perspective of Catholic thought, the process of dying should not be viewed as a useless experience," Mott argues. "A death that allows us the time to come to terms with our lives and those with whom we have lived it - to thank and be thanked, to forgive and be forgiven - is a good death."
Afterward, as Egbert removes the lock from his bicycle, I ask Mott if he considers the doctor a sinner. "Yes, he's sinning," Mott says as Egbert listens. "But I would add that it is based, I think, on a misunderstanding or ignorance."
"You're not going to imply I'm ignorant," Egbert shoots back.
Mott smiles. "I will."
On a wet September night in 2009, the tires of Egbert's bicycle skidded through a patch of soggy leaves, and he was thrown to the roadway. 
He had been on his way to deliver a sermon at Johns Hopkins. (Since his arrest, the university has not renewed his position as Unitarian campus minister, and he has not been asked back to review medical school applications, he says.) 
The accident cracked the front and back of his pelvis. Surgery wouldn't help, the doctors told him. He would have to learn to walk with a broken pelvis. Every time he shifted his weight or tried to take a step, pain shot through his body. 
In his agony, Egbert, who has witnessed the endings of so many lives, considered ending his own. "There are some people who like to suffer - that there is a religious gain in suffering," he says. "I don't believe that."
But he began to mend, and thoughts of living pushed aside thoughts of dying. 
When the end does come, Egbert figures, he'll "go into the ground and rot." He doesn't believe in an after-life, though many of his patients have found comfort in the belief that they will be going to a better place. "I don't think it's worthwhile to worry about what happens to you when you're dead."
He has been explicit about his wishes for his own death. He doesn't want to die in a nursing home or on a ventilator. When he's gone, he wants his body taken to Johns Hopkins University. He'd like it to be given to the researchers in the Parkinson's laboratory. 
They can place his body next to the bodies of people who died from Parkinson's disease, he reasons. He wants his body to be the scientific control. He hopes his body can be an example of a human being who died "a natural death," a death without extended suffering. A death without a hood.

France ponders Afghan pullout after four troops are killed

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A01

LENGTH: 257 words

DATELINE: PARIS

PARIS - France threatened Friday to unilaterally speed withdrawal of its troops from Afghanistan, underlining growing doubts about coalition unity in theU.S.-led effortto leave behind a lasting government in Kabul after more than a decade of war. 
President Nicolas Sarkozy and key members of his government made the threat in a burst of anger over the killings of four French soldiers and the wounding of more than a dozen by a renegade Afghan soldier who turned an automatic rifle on his trainers Friday morning at a mountaintop base northeast of Kabul. 
The attack, coming after a similar shooting less than a month ago, sabotaged confidence here in the training and transition effort that has become the top focus of U.S. and allied troops.
"We are friends of the Afghan people, allies of the Afghan people," said a visibly upset Sarkozy. "But I cannot accept that Afghan soldiers fire on French soldiers."
International concern has grown from repeated instances in which Afghan troops - infiltrated Taliban extremists or individuals with a score to settle - have shot their weapons or exploded bombs in attacks designed to kill and wound NATO forces. A report commissioned by the U.S. military said at least 58 Western military personnel were killed in 26 attacks by Afghan soldiers or police in the four years between May 2007 and May 2011, when the report was finished.
"Such fratricide is fast leading towards a crisis of trust between the two forces, if it hasn't reached this point already," the report concluded.

Gingrich's forgiveness ploy

BYLINE: Kathleen Parker

SECTION: EDITORIAL COPY; Pg. A17

LENGTH: 768 words

The standing ovation for Newt Gingrich on Thursday night, when he attacked CNN moderator John King for asking about allegations that Gingrich wanted an "open marriage" with his second wife, told us little about South Carolina but much about human nature.
The query, for which King has been exhaustively critiqued, was both necessary and inevitable. Forget the elephant in the living room; it was the herd in the powder room.  
Marianne Gingrich, to whom Gingrich was married when he began an affair with his current wife, Callista, had been in the news all day as excerpts of a then soon-to-be-released interview with ABC News were replayed dozens of times. By debate time, the words "open marriage," a stale phrase from the silly '70s when Gingrich was a bespectacled college professor with mutton-chop sideburns, were on the tips of the tongues of a million wags. 
Just as King had no choice but to ask, Gingrich answered in the only way he could - by attacking the questioner. Shooting the messenger is a time-honored method of spin control among royals and their imitators. Gingrich's bilious reproach was an oratorical defenestration. King's audacity was "despicable," he intoned, and the crowd roared.
Suddenly, Gingrich's questionable past was forgotten, and whatever ire his record might have inspired was redirected at The Media - that monolithic target of communal contempt. Not only did Gingrich deflect attention from his immediate problem, but he managed to win the public's heart. He may not have shifted the entire planet, as he described the object of his ambition in 1985, but he managed to secure his rising momentum in the state that consistently selects the Republican presidential nominee. 
People who know Gingrich, and certainly those enemies who convinced Marianne Gingrich that she should step forward for the good of the country, must have wondered how things could go so wrong. How could they have miscalculated that Gingrich's greatest liability could become his greatest strength? They did not, as one might first suppose, underestimate the public's disdain for the media. Very likely they share it. What they forgot were the lessons wrought by Whitewater prosecutor Kenneth Starr and the power of projection.
In a nutshell: The more you pick on a person for human failings with which all can identify, the more likely you will create sympathy rather than antipathy, especially if that individual has been forthright in his confession and penitent for his transgression, as Gingrich has been. He was ahead of the curveball this time, with nothing left to tell or for his aggrieved former wife to expose. Thus, her interview and the King question had the feel not of revelation but of a political hit aided and abetted by a salacious press.
Even Bill Clinton, who was less forthcoming and therefore, at least initially, less sympathetic, came to be viewed as a victim following months of investigation and the airing of sordid details only voyeurs could enjoy. Starr, as King, was merely doing his job, yet he became less likable than Clinton among Regular Joes watching television in their kitchens. However nobly Republicans may have considered their mission, everyday Americans - particularly men - saw persecution.
A Catholic friend captures the operative sentiment in terms Gingrich surely would appreciate. When she sees someone succumb to temptation or betray some other human frailty, she says: "I have those weeds in my garden."
To err is human; to forgive divine. We like that way of thinking because we all need others' forgiveness. When Gingrich turned to his audience and said that we all know pain - we all know people who have suffered pain - he instantly          morphed from sinner to savior, the redeemer in chief. He correctly counted on the empathy of his fellow man, if not necessarily womankind, and won the moment.
But a moment is just that, and projection of the sort experienced by the Charleston, S.C., audience can be fraught with peril. Over-identification clouds judgment, and, though we are all sinners, we are not all running for president of the United States. Gingrich's sins of the flesh ultimately are of less importance than the narcissism and grandiosity that compel his actions.
Voters would do well to think less of what they would do in his shoes than what Gingrich will do, should he win the prize. As the reality of his astonishing self-regard sinks in and one imagines where his unflagging certitude might lead, it is less easy to identify with the weeds in his garden. As projection falters, empathy finds no place to land.

An hour of peace, a year of fighting

It's date night on Capitol Hill again - also known as the State of the Union address.
Following last year's unusual decision to do away with partisan seating, many lawmakers are once again lining up colleagues from the other party to sit with for President Obama's address. The idea is to show that the two sides can sit together for an hour or so without elbowing each other. 
However, whatever hijinks or photo ops ensue Tuesday night, they probably won't create any lasting bipartisan goodwill. That's what last year's seating gimmick showed, anyway. From the moment the idea took off last January, in the wake of http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/bells-toll-as-tucson-remembers-deadly-shooting-rampage/2012/01/08/gIQAp864jP_story.html"                 title="www.washingtonpost.com-URL-the tragic shootings in Tucson, there were awkward stops and starts. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) couldn't figure out whom to sit with, particularly after House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) http://voices.washingtonpost.com/44/2011/01/arizona-lawmakers-to-save-seat.html-URL-turned him down because she'd already made arrangements with a different Republican.
Eventually, Cantor sat with a Democrat from the Virginia delegation, Rep. Bobby Scott, but it did little to foster a spirit of cooperation. By the fall, after contentious negotiations on raising the debt ceiling, Cantor was branded the http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/eric-cantor-gop-house-majority-leader-takes-a-starring-role-for-democrats/2011/10/06/gIQANLgvaL_story.html-URL-"face of Republican obstructionism" by Democrats and Obama.
Still, many lawmakers liked the mixed-seating idea and are http://www.nolabels.org/blog/sotu-whos-who-URL-set to reprise it, creating oddball couples such as Sens. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) and Mary Landrieu (D-La.), who are planning to sit side by side Tuesday. They have worked together on restoring the Gulf Coast after Hurricane Katrina and the BP oil spill . . . and on not much else.
In retrospect, a close examination of http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/01/25/us/politics/sotu-closer-look.html-URL-last year's seating chart serves as a telling preview of the year ahead. Here's a look at four "couples" from the 2011 State of the Union address who served as predictors of how the year would unfold - the sort of couples we'll be looking for Tuesday to see what 2012 may have in store for Congress.

Kevin McCarthy and Steny Hoyer
The House majority whip and minority whip, respectively, had their first close encounter last year during Obama's speech, beginning what would become semi-regular discussions designed to save the House from complete peril. Often rebuffed by a rump group of several dozen Republicans - some dubbed them the http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/apocalypse-on-capitol-hill-lawmakers-who-love-to-vote-no/2011/10/04/gIQA5AE5LL_story.html-URL-"Apocalypse Caucus" - McCarthy (Calif.) regularly could not get a majority from within his own GOP conference for critical legislation. There were just too many rebels. So he turned to Hoyer (Md.) to see how many Democratic votes he could deliver to save the day - and he usually did.

Charles E. Schumer and Tom Coburn
This was about as odd a senatorial duo as went on a date last year: Schumer, the liberal from Brooklyn, and Coburn, the arch-conservative doctor from Muskogee, Okla. Unfortunately, their date didn't lead to any lasting bond. Coburn became a high-profile member of the "Gang of Six" effort to strike a grand bargain to trim at least $4 trillion from future government borrowing. Behind the scenes, Schumer became the lead pit bull opposing the Gang, arguing that the group was going to cut too much from Medicare and Social Security. Angry at what he considered Democratic reluctance to dig into those entitlement programs, Coburn http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/gang-of-six-on-verge-of-collapse-as-republican-sen-coburn-withdraws/2011/05/17/AFA4f75G_story.html-URL-stormed out of the talks in May. The Gang eventually produced a set of principles but no legislation.
Jeb Hensarling and James E. Clyburn Once thehttp://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/cbo-confirms-debt-deal-would-save-at-least-21-trillion/2011/08/01/gIQAzmMVnI_story.html-URL-debt-ceiling deal was approvedin August, the "supercommittee" went to work, with the goal of finding at least $1.2 trillion in additional savings. Hensarling, the Texas Republican who is No. 4 among House leaders, and Clyburn, the South Carolina Democrat who is No. 3 in his party's leadership, were among the 12 lawmakers on the bipartisan panel. Whatever they talked about during last year's address, it didn't help during these negotiations. Along with Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Calif.), Clyburn was seen as an obstacle to any deal that cut entitlements. Hensarling, the GOP co-chairman, could not get the group to really jell. Its members spent the final weeks in small huddles away from Hensarling and Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), the other co-chairman. Just before Thanksgiving, the supercommitteehttp://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/who-had-the-worst-week-in-washington-the-supercommittee/2011/11/21/gIQAgA47kN_story.html"                 title="www.washingtonpost.com-URL-admitted it had failed.
Mitch McConnell and Harry Reid No, the Senate's majority leader and minority leader didn't sit together last year. They sat directly across the aisle from each other; neither brought a date from the opposing party. It was an omen of the partisan rancor to come. Consummate Senate insiders, McConnell (R-Ky.) and Reid (D-Nev.) played key roles in some spending fights andhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/debt-deadline-may-provide-another-mitch-mcconnell-moment/2011/07/14/gIQAyn68jI_story.html-URL-wrote much of the language for the debt deal that averted a national default. But their relationship grew more bitter throughout the year, culminating in a http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=6A2554ED-2712-47AE-B385-EA468B9BF6EB-URL-shouting match on the Senate floor in October. By the time the holidays rolled around, some senators tried to cheer things up with http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/senates-secret-santas-make-their-rounds/2011/12/13/gIQAQ0udsO_story.html"                 title="www.washingtonpost.com-URL-a bipartisan Secret Santa. More than 60 senators took part, exchanging gifts at a party. But McConnell and Reid were nowhere to be found. They declined to participate in the gift-giving fun.

Virginia's GOP pushes ambitious agenda

BYLINE: Laura Vozzella

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B01

LENGTH: 1290 words

DATELINE: RICHMOND

RICHMOND - Virginia Gov. Robert F. McDonnell warned his Republican brethren to take it slow this month as_blankthey took control of the state Senate.
"Don't be arrogant, don't overreach, don't fight," he told them.
If the flurry of legislation they've introduced is any indication, Virginia's most conservative Republicans aren't holding back.
They are pushing legislation to: wipe out corporate income taxes; mandate drug testing of welfare recipients; crack down on illegal immigrants; beef up gun rights, property rights, parental rights and fetal rights; roll back gay rights; and free the commonwealth from federal laws it doesn't like.
Those are the highlights of an 80-bill agenda that the Virginia Conservative Caucusunveiled last week in Richmond. It's an ambitious lineup, with twice the number of bills the group backed last year. 
Many of those bills have come and gone before, sailing through the Republican-dominated House but dying in the Senate, where Democrats ruled for the past four years and moderate Republicans held sway before that. With the GOP now in control of the evenly split Senate, there's hope among conservatives - and dread among liberals - that some of those measures will become law.
"It's an optimistic time right now," said Del. Ben L. Cline (R-Rockbridge), co-chairman of the conservative caucus. "We've got a conservative governor, a conservative House and a Senate with more conservatives in it. . . .  I think on issues from taxes to social issues to immigration to public safety, conservatives are hoping to move the ball forward."
Even as they seem to disregard _blankMcDonnell's advice, Virginia's most conservative legislators don't expect to get everything on their wish list in this _blankGeneral Assembly session.
Democrats are still in a position to block them in certain areas - the budget, tax bills, constitutional amendments and judicial appointments - because Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling (R)_blank lacks the authority to break tie votes on those matters. And on social issues such as guns and abortion, moderate Republicans could very well stand in their way.
McDonnell, who prides himself on working well with Republicans and Democrats alike, had hard-nosed political reasons for discouraging a pedal-to-the-metal, hard-right agenda. If conservatives go too far too quickly for voters in this swing state, there could be a backlash in November's U.S. Senate and presidential races, political observers say. It also could hurt McDonnell's chances to wind up as somebody's No. 2 on the Republican presidential ticket.
But for many conservatives who have been stymied for years by Democrats and moderate Republicans, there's little inclination to wait.
"Legislation's a lot like a football game; you move the ball down the field," said Del. James P. Massie III (R-Henrico), who has a bill this year to provide tax credits to corporations that provide scholarships for poor students to attend private schools. "And I think we're inside the five-yard line this year. And with the help of a couple more good Republicans like Dick Black over in the Senate . . . we'll punch this thing across the goal."
Black, a former delegate who moved up to the Senate this year, shares Massie's enthusiasm for the conservative agenda. But he seems less certain of its prospects.
"There's sort of a wait-and-see attitude," Black (R-Leesburg) said. "I think we will make progress. I think the pro-life, pro-family groups are going to be pleased at the end of the session. I don't think they'll feel like they just had the victory at Gettysburg. I just think they'll feel we've moved forward."
Black, who as a delegate was one of the strongest anti-abortion voices in the General Assembly, has a seat this year on the Senate Education and Health Committee, where for years most anti-abortion legislation died.
Senate Republicans heavily stacked some crucial committees in their favor, scrapping a rule that committee seats reflect the party makeup of the Senate as a whole. But education and health comes as close as possible to mirroring the Senate's 20-20 split, with eight Republicans (one of them chairman) and seven Democrats.
Some conservatives have grumbled that Senate Majority Leader Thomas K. Norment Jr. (R-James City), a moderate whom some conservatives considered replacing this year, did not do more to stack that committee, which has before it a number of abortion bills. One is the "_blankpersonhood" bill, which seeks to define life as beginning at conception. Abortion-rights supporters warn that it could effectively outlaw the procedure as well as some forms of birth control, such as intrauterine devices. Another bill would require that any woman seeking an abortion be offered an ultrasound image of the fetus beforehand.
"We're optimistic [about getting abortion bills out of committee], but you know it's not as secure of a position as we had hoped at the margins," Cline said. "There's a single-vote margin on the committee."
Adding to conservatives' concerns: One Republican member of the committee, Sen. Harry B. Blevins (Chesapeake), is a moderate. Some conservatives privately refer to Blevins as "the Justice Kennedy of education and health," comparing him to the frequent swing voter on the U.S. Supreme Court.
Blevins describes himself as "pro-life." He voted last year in favor of new rules that regulate abortion clinics like hospitals instead of like doctors' offices, as they had been. But he also said that unless and until the Supreme Court reverses Roe v. Wade, he is not inclined to support state measures to outlaw abortion.
"I think we have an obligation to uphold the law of the land," he said. "Some people have this lock-step mentality. I'm not inclined to do that. "
The conservative caucus also is pushing legislation that would allow faith-based adoption agencies to refuse to place children with gay couples; lift a state requirement that schoolgirls get _blankimmunized against a sexually transmitted disease;_blank_blank and lift a one-gun-a-month limit on handgun purchases. Another measure, called the _blankrepeal amendment, calls for amending the U.S. Constitution so that federal laws and regulations could be invalidated by agreement of two-thirds of state legislatures.
Legislation that could cost the state money could be a tough sell during tight budget times, some conservatives concede. But Cline, who sponsored a bill to eliminate the corporate income tax, said the measure could ultimately improve the state's fiscal picture by attracting more businesses to Virginia.
The caucus has vowed to fight a number of bills, including those that would prohibit public employers from discriminating against employees on the basis of sexual orientation; provide in-state college tuition to undocumented immigrants; and impose a 20-cent plastic bag tax. One Republican, Del. David B. Albo of Fairfax, managed to make the caucus's hit list with a _blankbill about bingo. (It would raise maximum prizes to $1,000, up from the maximum now of $599.)
While Republicans are not confident of their success, Democrats aren't feeling secure, either.
"We cannot become another Alabama or another Arizona. We represent something better," said Del. Alfonso Lopez (D-Arlington), a member of the Virginia Progressive Caucus, referring to a bill that would empower state police to enforce immigration law.
Sen. George L. Barker (D-Fairfax) isn't sure what to expect on the abortion bills he'll consider as a member of the Education and Health Committee or on the conservative agenda overall.
"I think some of them will get through the committee," he said. "How many will pass in the full Senate is definitely an open question. . . . We enter this year with a lot more uncertainty."

Pr. George's police shoot at suspect
Prince George's County police opened fire on a man who scuffled with them early Sunday after they responded to a domestic dispute in the Temple Hills neighborhood, police said.  
The man, whom police did not publicly identify or describe, apparently was not struck by police gunshots and fled from the scene, said Cpl. Evan Baxter, a Prince George's police spokesman.
Baxter said two officers encountered the man leaving a residence in the 2600 block of Keating Street when they responded about 4 a.m. to a call about a domestic dispute at that address. 
One or both of the officers fired an undetermined number of bullets at the man after he tussled with them, Baxter said.

Officer, suspect hurt in Howard crash
A Howard County police officer making a roadside arrest early Sunday was struck by a passing car, an accident that landed the officer, the suspect and the driver in the hospital, police said. 
Maryland State Police said the county officer, Richard M. Romberger Jr., 43; the man who was being arrested, Matthew J. Griffis, 27, of the 24000 block of Burnt Hill Road in Clarksburg; and the driver, Ricky A. Epperson, 25, of the 7800 block of East Hill Road in Mount Airy; were flown by helicopters to the Maryland Shock Trauma Center. The state police said their injuries were not life-threatening. 
Police said the crash was the culmination of a series of events that began before 2 a.m., when Griffis left the scene of an accident on Penn Shop Road. Griffis was located on eastbound Route 144, where Romberger apprehended him.
The two men were standing by the passenger side of Romberger's patrol car, one of several Howard police cruisers on the scene with their emergency lights flashing. Epperson drove up, clipped a state police patrol car that had just arrived and plowed into Romberger's car, hitting both men, state police said. 
No charges had been filed as of Sunday.

Leader suspendsBenghazi delegates
The head of Libya's transitional government on Sunday suspended delegates from Benghazi, the city that kicked off the movement that toppled ruler Moammar Gaddafi last year.
The suspension is the latest sign of discord within the body that led the anti-Gaddafi uprising but has struggled to establish an effective government to replace his regime.
The announcement came the day after protesters stormed the National Transitional Council offices in Benghazi and carted off computers, chairs and desks while Mustafa Abdul-Jalil, head of the council, was holed up inside. 
Abdul-Jalil told the Associated Press he suspended the six representatives from Benghazi, the main city in eastern Libya. They can continue to serve only if approved by the local city council.
Abdul-Jalil said he appointed a council of religious leaders to investigate corruption charges and identify people with links to the Gaddafi regime.
The body's deputy head, Abdel-Hafiz Ghoga, resigned in protest over the suspensions.

Fighting in capitalleaves nine dead
Somali militants firing vehicle-mounted anti-aircraft guns clashed with African Union forces for a second night in Mogadishu, killing at least nine people, including women and children, an ambulance official said Sunday.
African Union troops launched a new offensive against al-Shabab on Friday, seizing rebel positions just outside the capital for the first time.
The insurgents, however, have launched counterattacks.
Meanwhile, scores of families fled Elasha town and the surrounding area after al-Shabab said a missile fired by a U.S. drone had hit a car in the town, killing one of its senior foreign militants.
In a statement e-mailed late Saturday, the insurgents said the militant was British passport holder Bilal el Berjawi, also known as Abu Hafsa, of Lebanese descent. The statement said Berjawi had grown up in west London and joined Somalia's Islamist militants in early 2006.
But a British foreign office official denied that Berjawi was a British national. No other details were immediately available.

Passenger counton ship in question
Unregistered passengers might have been aboard the stricken cruise liner that capsized off the coast of Italy last week, a top rescue official said Sunday, raising the possibility that the number of missing might be higher than the 20 previously announced.
Franco Gabrielli, the head of the Civil Protection Authority, said relatives of a Hungarian woman have told Italian authorities that she had telephoned them from aboard the ship and that they haven't heard from her since the accident. He said it was possible that a woman's body pulled from the wreckage by divers on Saturday might be that of the unregistered passenger.
But the identity of that body and of three male bodies, all badly decomposed after days in the water, have yet to be established.

Conservative takes early lead in Finnish election: Polls closed in Finland's presidential election Sunday with advance ballots giving the conservative pro-Europe favorite a clear lead, but without the majority needed to avoid a runoff. The count of 1.3 million early ballots, representing a quarter of the electorate, showed Sauli Niinisto, a former finance minister, winning 40 percent, according to official preliminary results.
U.S. envoy gives Taliban terms for peace talks: The Taliban must promise to disassociate from international terrorism and affirm their desire to participate in tentative talks on a political settlement to the war in Afghanistan, a senior U.S. official said Sunday. Marc Grossman, the U.S. special envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan, said during a visit to Kabul that Pakistan also had to play a key role in any peace talks, but sought to downplay tensions stemming from Islamabad's decision not to allow Grossman to visit Pakistan as planned.
OPEC wants to stay out of spat, Iran says: OPEC's acting president said the producer group should stay out of political battles, Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency reported Sunday, an apparent bid by the bloc to steer clear of a potential showdown between Tehran and the United States over threats to close the Strait of Hormuz. Iraqi Oil Minister Abdul-Karim Elaibi said that while Iran's "enemies" have imposed various sanctions on the Islamic Republic, the 12-nation Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' main focus should be protecting its members' interest and not being dragged into a political struggle over oil.

Giffords resigning from Congress

BYLINE: Sandhya Somashekhar;Paul Kane

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A03

LENGTH: 808 words

Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was only a few minutes into her "Congress on your Corner" meeting with constituents when the gunman struck. Now, one of her last acts in Congress will be to finish that meeting.
The Arizona Democrat announced Sunday that she will resign from her congressional seat this week, about one year after sustaining massive injuries in the massacre in Tucson that killed six, wounded 13 and sparked a nationwide conversation about the tenor of the country's political debate.
She nearly died from the gunshot wound to her head, and the severity of the damage to her brain left the extent of her recovery in question. But it was in a clear and strong voice that betrayed only a hint of her ordeal that Giffords announced her decision, in a videoposted on her campaign Web site. 
"I don't remember much from that horrible day, but I will never forget the trust you placed in me to be your voice," she said, looking directly into the camera. The hair that had been severely cropped after the shooting now framed her face in soft curls. "I have more work to do on my recovery, so to do what is best for Arizona, I will step down this week."

One last hurrah
Before handing in her resignation to House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) and Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer (R), Giffords has some unfinished business. She plans to attend President Obama's State of the Union address on Tuesday. And she will finish the meeting that was "interrupted," her staff said in a statement, by gathering with some of the survivors at a private event in Tucson.
The announcement came as an emotional blow to many of her friends and supporters, who had hoped she would recover enough to run for reelection or even for the Senate. But it was not entirely unexpected.
For months, her devoted staff shouldered the burdens of her office while she underwent multiple surgeries and intensive therapy in Houston, where her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, lived. Giffords made a remarkable recovery, but with her term ending this year, her constituents wondered whether she would be up to the challenge of running for reelection.
Bill Badger, a retired Army colonel who was injured in the shooting, said he does not begrudge her the decision.
"I fully support her decision to not run again and I understand, because I was shot in the head myself - not as seriously as Gabby - and I know how it changed my priorities and changed my life," Badger said.
Giffords's decision means that a special election will be held in the next few months, and despite rumors that her husband might run for her seat, Democratic officials in Washington and Arizona do not expect Kelly or any of Giffords's top staff members to do so.
Giffords's southern Arizona district, which is on the Mexican border, is widely considered a swing district, and several candidates of both parties have expressed interest in running for the seat.
In the end, Giffords did what was in her best interests and those of her constituents, said Fred DuVal, a friend and Democratic operative from Phoenix.
"It feels like a responsible decision in the sense that her health comes first, her recovery first," he said. "And, secondly, knowing her so well, she's not capable of making a commitment that she can't engage with full talent and responsibility. I'm sure she balanced that and always wanted to do right by the people she represents."
Before the shooting, Giffords had been a rising star in the Democratic Party, a centrist politician and talented communicator who championed stronger border security, veterans' rights and solar energy. In its aftermath, she became a national symbol for the effort to restore civility to American politics, following a brutal 2010 midterm election in which even Giffords's race turned into a bitter battle.

A peacemaker
Lawmakers set aside their partisan divisions to sit togetherfor last year's State of the Union address - before the legislature dissolved again into gridlock over the budget. Giffords served as a sort of peacemaker for the body in August, when she made a surprise appearance on Capitol Hill to vote in favor of raising the nation's debt limit, with members on both sides of the aisle bursting into applause, many choking up or openly crying. Some stood on their chairsto get a glimpse of her.
At the end of September, Giffords had $879,000 in her campaign account, money that was raised almost entirely by the efforts of her close friends in Congress, including Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.).
Giffords by law cannot use that money for personal expenses, but she could transfer it to the Democratic Party for use in the special election or donate it to a charity. She could also keep the funds in that account for a future political race.

Midwest

Wet weather affects at least six states
Freezing drizzle and rain made roads slick Sunday as a winter weather system moved across portions of the Upper Midwest, and the precipitation was expected to begin changing over into snow that could continue into Monday.
The National Weather Service issued winter weather advisories for most of Minnesota and South Dakota, nearly all of Wisconsin, and parts of North Dakota and Iowa for late Sunday.
The precipitation was coming from a low-pressure system expected to track east across Nebraska and Iowa and deepen as it moved northeast across Wisconsin, it said.

Woman, 101, is keptfrom returning home
The federal government says a 101-year-old Detroit woman who was promised she could move back into her home after a foreclosure four months ago cannot return because the house is unsanitary and unsafe.
Texana Hollis was evicted Sept. 12 and her belongings placed outside after her 65-year-old son did not pay property taxes linked to a reverse mortgage and the Department of Housing and Urban Development foreclosed on the home.
Two days later, the department said she could return. But now HUD says it will not let Hollis move back in because of the house's condition. She had lived there about 60 years.

As her final act in office, Giffords bids farewell to Ariz. constituents

DATELINE: TUCSON

TUCSON - On a bittersweet day, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords spent her final hours in Tucson as the city's representative in the U.S. House finishing the meeting she started on the morning she was shot and bidding farewell to constituents who supported her through a long recovery.
It may not be the end, though. The woman whose improbable recovery captivated the nation promised, "I will return." 
The Arizona Democrat spent time Monday at her office with other survivors of the Jan. 8, 2011, shooting rampage that left six people dead and 13 injured. She hugged and talked with survivors, including Suzi Hileman, who was shot three times while trying to save her young friend and neighbor, 9-year-old Christina Taylor Green. The little girl died from a gunshot wound.
"The last time I did this I had Christina's hand," Hileman said. 
Others who met with Giffords included Pat Maisch, who was hailed as a hero for wrestling a gun magazine from the shooter that day, and Daniel Hernandez, Giffords's intern at the time who helped save her life by trying to stop her bleeding until an ambulance arrived.
"It was very touching," said Maisch, who was not hurt in the attack. "I thanked her for her service, wished her well, and she just looked beautiful."
Giffords, who was in her third term in Congress, announced Sunday that she would resign this week to focus on her recovery. Maisch was sad to think that Giffords would no longer be her congresswoman.
"But I want her to do what's best for her," she said. "She's got to take care of herself."
An upbeat Giffords hinted, however, that her departure from public life might be temporary. In a message sent on Twitter, she said: "I will return & we will work together for Arizona & this great country."
In her last act in Tucson as a congresswoman, Giffords visited one of her favorite charities, the Community Food Bank of Southern Arizona.
The food bank established the Gabrielle Giffords Family Assistance Center with $215,000 it received in the wake of the shooting. Giffords's husband, former astronaut Mark Kelly, had urged people who wanted to help Giffords after the shooting to donate to the charity. 
The center has helped 900 families get on food stamps in the past year and offered guidance to families seeking assistance with housing, insurance, clothing and other basic needs.
"It's a wonderful thing that she gets to come here and see the center we built," said Bill Carnegie, the food bank's chief executive. "But it's also her exit from Congress. I'm concerned about the future."
Giffords's aides yelled at TV cameramen and reporters who surrounded the congresswoman as she arrived, telling them to back up. Giffords didn't bat an eye and walked with confidence into the building, where she hugged Carnegie and others.
When she saw the center named in her honor, she said "Wow" and "Awesome."
When one woman told Giffords, "I love your new hairstyle," she beamed and responded, "Thank you."
Giffords did not address reporters and planned to head to the airport right after her visit. She was expected in Washington on Tuesday for President Obama's State of the Union address.
In her announcement Sunday, Giffords said that by stepping down, she was doing what is best for Arizona.
"I don't remember much from that horrible day, but I will never forget the trust you placed in me to be your voice," she said in a video posted online. 
"I have more work to do on my recovery," the congresswoman said at the end of the two-minute message, appearing to strain to communicate.
C.J. Karamargin, who was Giffords's spokesman until recently, said he can only imagine what she is feeling as she steps down.
"But Gabby would never want to do a job unless she could give everything to it," he said.
"The news of her stepping down was almost more emotional than this time last year, because then, she had survived and had a positive prognosis. Now we've got this pause, this comma, in her career . . . and she won't be back anytime soon," he said. 
Giffords was shot in the head at point-blank range as she was meeting with constituents outside a grocery store.

Detective accused of selling weapons

BYLINE: Matt Zapotosky

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B01

LENGTH: 519 words

Tasked with taking guns off the streets, Prince George's County Police Detective Juan Carter instead stole and sold them, prosecutors said Monday. When investigators were tipped to his scheme, he made efforts to throw them off, prosecutors said.  
The accusations were made Monday during opening statements in Carter's trial in Prince George's County Circuit Court. Although prosecutors did not fully lay out the evidence they have, they accused Carter of profiting by selling the very shotguns, machine guns and handguns he was assigned to take away from criminals. 
"He was a man who was a gun dealer on the streets with a badge," prosecutor Jonathon Church told jurors. 
Carter was indicted in 2010 on 13 counts of misconduct in office and theft. The Prince George's narcotics detective was a member of a state task force that worked to take guns from criminals, and prosecutors said in court Monday that he was specially tasked - because of his rank - with logging some of the evidence the task force seized. 
At one point, more than 20 guns the task force had taken were missing, authorities have said. Those guns, sources have said, were traceable in some way to Carter.
One of them was used in the September 2009 shooting of off-duty Officer Eric Horne when two men tried to carjack his vehicle, authorities have said.
Prosecutors did not say in opening statements how many guns they allege were taken. 
Douglas Wood, Carter's attorney, said his client did not steal the weapons. He said that Carter was a good, aggressive officer but that his paperwork, and that of others on the task force, was sometimes sloppy. 
Carter made $80,000 to $90,000 a year and lived comfortably with his wife in Bowie, so he had no financial motive to sell seized guns, Wood said. 
"In a sense, they're trying to make him a fall guy for some things that happened," he said.
Carter was suspended with pay in 2009 while internal affairs detectives investigated the weapons' disappearance, then suspended without pay after his 2010 indictment. He remains suspended without pay, said Cpl. Mike Rodriguez, a Prince George's police spokesman. 
The task force, which according to state records seized nearly 430 guns from its inception in 2007 to September 2009, has been disbanded, authorities have said. 
Church said detectives first began investigating Carter in 2009, when some guns that were supposed to have been seized turned up on the streets. The prosecutor said that Carter made excuses when questioned about the weapons and that at least one computer zip drive containing seizure records was destroyed. 
"For a while, the defendant got away with it," Church said. "He thought nobody was watching, but it caught up to him."
Carter's trial is expected to last at least two more days. 
Prosecutors and defense lawyers questioned two witnesses Monday: an internal affairs investigator and a task force commander. Wood's questions focused on imperfect record-keeping and evidence collection by task force members and investigators, while prosecutors tried to demonstrate the correct procedure for processing seized guns.

Young hearts race in 'Two Gentlemen of Verona'

BYLINE: Nelson Pressley

SECTION: STYLE; Pg. C01

LENGTH: 767 words

 The Shakespeare Theatre Company's entertaining but over-the-top "The Two Gentlemen of Verona" wastes no time coming at you. PJ Paparelli's production of Shakespeare's comedy about double-crossing friends opens in a fast-food parking lot with teenagers engaging in binge drinking; within a minute a kid tosses his cookies. Music pounds, and snarky text-message narration flashes on a screen overhead. Guns are around. Like the pulse of a 17-year-old, it's all very racy.
If Paparelli has a signature, this is it. Several seasons ago he created an exceptionally youthful, remarkably raw "Romeo and Juliet," and his "columbinus" was an arresting and incisive depiction of the 1999 high school shootings in Colorado. Both shows were first-rate dramatic studies of kids on the edge. 
You can see why Paparelli would return to this territory - though not why he pushes it to such unexpectedly grim heights - for the infrequently staged "Two Gents." The play is about young lovers and whiplash impulses: Valentine teases his pal Proteus for mooning over a lass named Julia, but everything changes when the boys hit the big town of Milan. Both guys fall for the Duke's elegant daughter Silvia, with the changeable Proteus proving especially willing to forget fair Julia and backstab his buddy.
Yes, it's a comedy: The play has two clowns and a dog, and the lovers and friends spend a lot of time swapping witty repartee. But the emotional switchbacks are sharp, and the play's sudden ending threatens real violence. The climax of this play, arguably Shakespeare's earliest, is notoriously impossible.
Paparelli's solution is to plunge us into the hothouse emotions of adolescence, and for much of the show he makes it a real ride. Walt Spangler's metallic set juts out into the Lansburgh Theatre, with catwalks crisscrossing the stage and giant commercial logos (Apple, McDonald's, many more) casting a Times Square glow while promoting an aura of instant gratification. The characters tease each other on smartphones and croon sappy love songs in a karaoke bar; except for Paul Spadone's peculiarly stiff Elizabethan/modern mashup costumes, it's all very familiar and energetic.
It's well-acted, too, which comes as a relief. (The show is so action-packed you worry sometimes about its ability to calm down and talk.) Especially winning are the clowns, played by the admirably relaxed Adam Green and Euan Morton. Green is droll and drily amused as Speed, Valentine's servant-with-a-skateboard, and Morton beams as Launce, the loopy fool who mopes over the seeming indifference of his dog Crab (tranquilly played by a shaggy, cock-eared pooch named Oliver).
It takes a while for the lovers to really pop out, but eventually Andrew Veenstra makes an appealing Valentine, while Nick Dillenburg shows glimpses of the Iago he may someday be in his smoothly self-serving Proteus. Natalie Mitchell has a fine imperial presence as Silvia and Miriam Silverman's plucky, pouty Julia brings welcome passion to the finish.
If the show doesn't quite click, it's largely because of its cineplex-style use of U2 tunes and firearms. Music is oxygen in this milieu, of course, but some of the songs Paparelli and his composer and sound designer Fabian Obispo use are so painfully on the nose as to be eye-rolling. There are "Glee"-spirited moments that will make you laugh, but that's offset by the sense of applying an easy pop patch where the characters or story seem reluctant to fly.
But the big test of how you feel about this lively "Two Gents" is how you respond to its violence. Some of the chase scenes and scuffles on those catwalks are fabulous, but this weaponized show repeatedly pushes its kids to extreme moments of despair and self-damage with razors and pistols, making this play darker and more disturbing than "Romeo and Juliet."
In his last plays, Shakespeare used magic and an expansive spirit to make us accept crazy tales. For the rougher "Two Gents," Paparelli gets it done at gunpoint.

The power to heal

BYLINE: Preston Williams

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. D01

For years, one of the most imposing high school basketball  players in the Washington area was scared to go outside. A victim of a gunshot wound and subsequent robbery when he was 10 years old, Demetric Austin spent his days monitoring his Southeast Washington neighborhood through a Venetian blind. He double checked locks. He dragged his mattress outside his mother's bedroom door and wailed for her to let him in so he would not have to sleep alone in his room. ֲ¶ "Please don't let me have no more bad nightmares," he would pray many nights. ֲ¶ When he arrived at SpringbrookHigh School 21 / 2 years ago, he found the fresh start and supportive community he was looking for.  ֲ¶ When teachers and students at the Silver Spring school look at Austin, they don't see the recluse who was the subject of a 2005 newspaper story (headline: "D.C. Boy's Wounds Don't Heal.") They see the brawny yet graceful leading scorer and rebounder of the ninth-ranked Blue Devils, a 6-foot-7, 250-pounder nicknamed "Tree," who just might be the best public school boys' basketball player in Montgomery County.  
They also see a newly dedicated student who, a year after getting dismissed from the team for academic reasons, is making the most of a network of faculty, coaches and community members. 
"He took an active role in his own intervention," said psychologist Bruce Purnell of Higher Hopes to the Outcomes, a youth mentoring organization in the District and Prince George's County, who has worked with Austin since 2005. "The whole idea of transformation - he's become the ideal. He's really evolved into the best part of himself."
Still, with his grades now intact and colleges such as DePaul, Saint Peter's and Seton Hall showing interest,  Austin is never that far from flashbacks - and fear. 
"It doesn't matter if you're 7 foot 4, and 300" pounds, Austin said. "A gun bullet will go through you."
Austin's mother, Tandra, remembers when her son would spend so many hours roaming the neighborhood during long play sessions that he would report home only for a drink or to eat. That suddenly changed on Feb. 9, 2005.
At about 7 p.m., Austin was playing three-on-three basketball on the playground behind his Benning Terrace Complex apartment building when gunfire rang out, apparently intended for some "gang-bang" boys hanging out nearby. 
After Austin dashed home, he discovered that he had been grazed in the back and had two holes in his upper right arm, requiring an ambulance ride to Children's Hospital.
A few days later, he was on an outing with one of his sisters, Latavia, to buy a video game to soothe him after the shooting. At a bus stop on Benning Road, three men emerged from behind bushes and put a gun to Latavia's head even after she had surrendered her prized North Face jacket. They took her coat and her cash. Demetric fled.
"After the robbing happened, I said to myself that I would never go outside again," Austin said softly on the bleachers at Springbrook after a recent Saturday morning practice. 
Other than school, Austin's life was mostly four walls, TV, video games and maybe some homework. Stepping into the hallway outside his apartment door was like entering a haunted house, first at Benning Terrace and then in the similarly intimidating Barry Farm neighborhood, where a government agency moved his single-parent family. Austin recalls hearing gunfire many nights.
"I was scared for my son's life," Tandra Austin said. "Not only my son's life, but the rest of my kids."
Friends tried to coax Austin out, assuring him that they would keep him safe. If his buddies were able to lure him, Austin had a rule: He had to stay within a five-second radius of the front door of his building, two steps and one dive from peril.
He got a test run one day when the gunfire he thought he heard turned out to be a firecracker.
"I was that nervous, that paranoid," Austin said. "I thought every time I go outside someone is going to try to rob me or shoot me. If I saw a gun shell or bullet, my heart would drop."
Months after those incidents, Austin moved in with his paternal grandparents, Otha and Eunice Blount, in Northwest Washington, near Coolidge High School. Their home was a haven. Austin sang in the choir at New Southern Rock Baptist Church. He was baptized there. "Got to know Jesus," as he said. But he was still scared.
"Even when he was with his grandmother, he still didn't leave their sight," said Tandra Austin, who in 2009 relocated to Montgomery County, where she lived for a time at Greentree Shelter, a transitional home for families in need. "He still stayed in the house."
Building relationships with strangers was not easy. Settings mattered. "He was apprehensive about being certain places at certain times," said Austin's uncle, Tony Perry.
Looking back now, Austin, 17,  and his mother think by sequestering himself indoors, Austin might have saved himself from falling into a violent lifestyle himself.
"Either you become so hard and callous that you're able to survive, or you withdraw," said Purnell, whom Austin now refers to as "Uncle Bruce." "It's a crossroad: Do I withdraw, or am I going to fight, and if so, what does this fight look like?"
Still reserved and cautious, Austin has regained some of his spirit at Springbrook, particularly in the past year, when he got serious about his grades. His dismissal from the team last yearmight have cost the Blue Devils, who finished 22-3, a chance at a fourth straight Maryland 4A title.
"I think I really hurt them," Austin said, "so I have that down in my heart."
Austin began to form meaningful relationships with many of his Springbrook teachers last winter. He was transferred into Wellington Uzamere's geometry class, where with constant prodding he earned a B the second semester.
To make sure Austin stayed on top of his school work, Springbrook Coach Tom Crowell sent him to Spanish teacher Joyce Amatucci,  who serves as an academic adviser for many Springbrook athletes.
"He got, I don't know, quadruple-teamed by anybody we could get on his case," Amatucci said. "He cared enough inside to do it. He had that or he wouldn't have gotten this far. . . . I guess even though he was a victim, he's decided not to be one."
At various times, Austin has received help from basketball coaches and team parents for  things ranging from rides to dental work. But he does not take them for granted, which is one reason they are so eager to help him or provide what amounts to a personal taxi service.
"He's one of the type of kids where Christmas Day he'll text you, 'Merry Christmas, all you do for me means so much to me and my family,' " Springbrook assistant coach Darnell Myers said.
Assistant coach Rob Harmon, a 1965 Springbrook graduate, takes Austin out on odd jobs to help him earn some money. They mow lawns, rake leaves, shovel snow, clean out garages, do basic carpentry. 
"He's the best worker I've ever had," Harmon said. "And he's almost the only one who calls me regularly looking for work, too."
On a couple of occasions during those chores, Austin said a sensation has swept over him: Wow. I'm outside enjoying what I'm doing, and I'm not scared at all.
For a player considered to be "a man among boys" by one of his coaches, and "the man around the house" by his mother, Austin is still insecure when he feels susceptible to violence, whether that threat is real or imagined.
He avoids being out after dark, particularly alone. Seeing police officers comforts him. He keeps his head on a swivel "to make sure nothing will happen to me." If he hears a car creeping up behind him? "You'll see me fly down the street," he said.
One time after he did that, friends showed up at his door a few minutes later. "Why'd you run?" they asked him. Then he tells them his story.
"He always wants to make sure he's safe and that others are safe, too," Springbrook senior forward Charles Taylor said.
Austin is striving to become the first in his five-child family to graduate from high school - he has two older sisters and two younger. He brings tapes of his games home to watch with his mother, who does not make it to many. She is amazed that the boy on the screen, the one throwing his weight around underneath the basket and averaging 16.3 points and 14 rebounds, is the same frightened son who peeked out the window wondering what his messed-up world would throw at him next.
"To be honest, I never thought this lifetime would ever come," Austin said. "I never thought that I'd make it to get college offers . . . or even be on the varsity team being a leader. I never thought I'd ever make the honor roll.
"I was a scared child, and right now, I'm a happy child. Happy as can be."

Afghanistan

Court-martial urgedin the death of GI
An investigative hearing has recommended that an American soldier be court-martialed over hazing that allegedly led to a fellow infantryman's suicide in Afghanistan but dismissed the most serious charge against him, the U.S. military said Monday.
Spec. Ryan Offutt is one of eight soldiers charged in the death of 19-year-old Pvt. Danny Chen, who shot himself Oct. 3 after what investigators say were weeks of physical abuse, humiliation and racial slurs. 
A native New Yorker of Chinese descent, Chen had been in Afghanistan only two months when he shot himself in a guardhouse at a remote outpost in Afghanistan's Kandahar province. His family has said investigators told them that he was subjected to racial slurs and forced to do excessive sit-ups, push-ups, runs and sprints carrying sandbags.
Chen's family members said Monday that they were upset that the most serious charge, involuntary manslaughter, was set aside.
The investigative hearing recommended that Offutt, 32, be court-martialed on charges including assault, negligent homicide and reckless endangerment, a statement from U.S. military said. The hearing ended Sunday at Kandahar Airfield, the sprawling base for U.S. and NATO operations in the south.

Troops shoot at Tibetan protesters
Chinese troops fired on thousands of Tibetans protesting in the southwestern province of Sichuan on Monday, killing at least one and wounding more, two overseas advocacy groups said.
Free Tibet, a London-based group that campaigns for Tibetan self-determination, said the protesters gathered at an intersection in Luhuo, about 370 miles west of Sichuan's capital, Chengdu, and marched on government offices, where security forces opened fire about midday.
The Tibetans were protesting arrests made earlier in the day in connection with the distribution of pamphlets carrying the slogan "Tibet Needs Freedom" and declaring that more Tibetans were ready to stage self-immolations to challenge Chinese rule, the group said in a statement.
One resident, a 49-year-old Tibetan man called Yonten, was shot dead by government forces, and about 30 residents were injured, according to Free Tibet.

More bodies found in cruise ship: Italian officials say two more bodies have been pulled from a cruise liner capsized off the Tuscan coast, bringing the number of confirmed dead to 15. An official in charge of the search said Monday that divers had recovered the bodies of two women from the ship's Internet cafe. The recovery brings to 17 the number of known missing.
Palestinian woman held in bathroom for years: A Palestinian woman was imprisoned for nine years in a bathroom by her father, beaten, barely fed and only let out at night, a social worker and police said Monday. She was given only a blanket, a radio, and a razor blade by her father, who encouraged her to kill herself, said the social worker, Hala Shreim. Palestinian police freed Baraa Melhem on Saturday in the West Bank town of Qalqilya, after a relative told authorities of the woman's plight.

To honorRep. Giffords

BYLINE: Editorial Board

SECTION: EDITORIAL COPY; Pg. A18

LENGTH: 438 words

IT TOOK A MATTER of seconds during a gathering with constituents at a Tucson shopping center for Rep. Gabrielle Giffords's (D-Ariz.) life to be profoundly transformed. Ms. Giffords was one of 19 people wounded or killed there last year, allegedly by a deranged young man who inflicted unspeakable damage with the help of a semi-automatic weapon and an extended magazine clip. The bullet that pierced Ms. Giffords's head left her clinging to life; hers has been a remarkable rehabilitation over the past 12 months, during which she has learned to walk and speak again.  
But Ms. Giffords has made clear that this journey is far from over. "I have more work to do on my recovery," she said during a two-minute video released Sunday. She  announced that she would not seek reelection from Arizona's 8th Congressional District and would step down from her post this week after attending President Obama's State of the Union address on Tuesday evening. A special election will be held in the next few months to temporarily fill the seat before voters return to the polls in the fall to select a permanent replacement. 
In announcing her decision to resign, Ms. Giffords displayed the grace and buoyancy of spirit that have come to be hallmarks of her tenure. She could have exploited voters' sympathy to retain the seat; instead, she placed the needs of her constituents first. Implicit in the decision to step down - or as she put it, "to do what's best for Arizona" -  was an understanding that she probably could not carry out the demands of public life before recuperating further.
Ms. Giffords did not refer directly to the events of Jan. 8, 2011, other than to say that she remembered little about that horrific day. But it would be a disservice to her life and that of the others directly affected by this, and tragedies like it, to ignore the factors that precipitated the violence: the easy access to guns; the availability of accessories such as extended clips that make deadly weapons all the more lethal; and a porous and shoddy regulatory system that too often fails to keep these weapons out of the hands of dangerous or dangerously unstable individuals.
Mr. Obama last year delivered his State of the Union just weeks after the Tucson massacre and in the presence of victims' family members. Yet he, like so many politicians intimidated by the gun lobby's muscle, could not muster a single word about the need for reasonable gun control measures to ward off such violence in the future. Perhaps he will find the courage to speak up this year, as Ms. Giffords looks on during her last State of the Union as a member of Congress.

Fear of war is palpable in divided Syrian city

BYLINE: Liz Sly

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A12

LENGTH: 964 words

DATELINE: HOMS, SYRIA

HOMS, Syria - It was lunchtime on Monday in this frightened, divided city and the streets were emptying fast. As gunfire crackled ominously in the air, merchants pulled down their shutters, soldiers peered nervously over sandbagged positions and people scurried home down deserted alleyways.
If Homs is not a city already in the throes of a full-blown war, between revolutionaries seeking to topple the Syrian regime and the pro-government forces determined to uphold it, then such a war does not feel far away. 
On Monday, it seemed to come just a little closer, in Homs and beyond. An Arab League blueprint for President Bashar al-Assad to surrender power was rejected by the Syrian government, raising the stakes dramatically both for the beleaguered regime and for an increasingly emboldened opposition.
The unexpected Arab proposal also intensified pressure on the international community, which has struggled for months to formulate a coherent response to the Syrian crisis. By seeking U.N. Security Council endorsement for the plan, which envisages a transition of power similar to the one underway in Yemen, the Arab League appeared to open the door for broader international involvement in the Syrian crisis, including, perhaps, military intervention.
In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland called the Arab move "really quite remarkable." America's priority now, she added, is to seek a  Security Council resolution that would add to the pressure on Assad.
But there was still no indication that Russia is prepared to lift its objections to tougher action at the United Nations, which Moscow fears could lead to international military intervention in Syria, as happened in Libya.
Activist groups inside Syria also rejected the Arab blueprint. "What we heard is not even close to what the revolutionaries in Syria are demanding," said a statement by the Syrian Revolution Coordinators Union. "We will persist until the fall of the regime, believing in God and trusting the heroic Free Syrian Army," the group added, referring to the loosely organized rebel army that is asserting responsibility for a growing number of attacks against Syrian security forces.
Syrians on both sides of the widening schism predicted more violence, as the government digs in and the opposition seeks to exploit the advantage of the gradually hardening international resolve.
"Violence will escalate because this Free Syrian Army will think they have won a lot and that now it's a piece of cake to take power," said a Syrian journalist in Damascus who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.
Omar Shakir, an activist in Homs contacted by telephone, said he expected the government to escalate the use of force. "Assad feels the world is against him, and so I think he will get mad and it will be very dangerous," he said.
On a government-supervised visit Monday to Homs, which has emerged as the epicenter of the protest movement and also the fledgling armed rebellion, the dangers were vividly apparent. This once-vibrant city, Syria's third largest, resembles a war zone, with earthen mounds blocking streets and protecting government buildings, and sandbagged checkpoints dotting residential neighborhoods.
At the military hospital on the edge of the city, the toll that the burgeoning armed insurgency is taking on the Syrian security forces was clear. At a solemn ceremony on the hospital grounds, soldiers and police escorted three of their comrades, slain the previous day in ambushes, toward the cemetery nearby.
In the mortuary, doctors showed journalists the charred remains of four corpses stuffed into plastic bags, among 11 victims of a separate ambush the same day that had incinerated a minibus. In the intensive care unit, a soldier shot in the head that morning in the town of Qusair was fighting for his life.
The director of the hospital, Brig. Gen. Ali Assi, said that 859 members of the security services had been killed in Homs since the uprising began in March and that four to five typically had been killed each day. In the past three weeks, however, the daily average has climbed to 10 to 12 as the conflict appears to be intensifying, said orthopedic surgeon Hussein al-Habet.
"This is war," he said. "And it is the worst kind of war in the military sense, because everyone in the world is against us and there are people fighting us from inside."
The Homs Revolutionary Council, the leading opposition group in the city, asserts that 2,052 people have been killed by government security forces in the past 10 months.
In the ancient Christian neighborhood of Hamidiyeh, residents seemed as confused as they were afraid. The conflict is rapidly taking on sectarian overtones, with majority Sunnis lining up behind the protesters and Shiite-affiliated Alawites rallying behind their Alawite president.
Khaldiyeh, one of two Sunni neighborhoods that has come under the control of the Free Syrian Army, is a short walk away, and Christians say they feel squeezed between the two sides. Four have been kidnapped from the neighborhood in recent weeks. One was killed, even though his family paid a ransom.
Firefights have become a daily occurrence, and the shooting seems to be closing in, said a man working in a sweet shop who was too frightened to give his name. "It's not a real war, but there are clashes every day and it's getting worse," he said. "We don't know who is shooting who. It's both sides. It's very scary."

Saunders 'somewhat surprised' by decision

BYLINE: Michael Lee

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. D05

LENGTH: 383 words

Never has the phrase "relieved of his duties" sounded more appropriate. Considering the hardships that Flip Saunders had to endure during his 2-plus seasons with the Washington Wizards - the death of Abe Pollin, a gun incident involving Gilbert Arenas, the death of his mother and the excruciating pains of rebuilding - being asked to step away after a 2-15 start probably felt like a relief.  
But Saunders said in a telephone interview "disappointment" was the overwhelming emotion he felt on Tuesday, when team President Ernie Grunfeld informed him that he was fired. Saunders was "somewhat surprised" by the move, believing that the team had made some progress before a "stinker" in Philadelphia, where the team lost, 103-83, and trailed by 30 points at halftime.
"It was probably as disappointing a loss, maybe since I've been here," said Saunders, who lost 130 of 181 games with the Wizards. 
He understand that someone had to take the blame for the Wizards' terrible record since he took over, but when asked if he wishes he could have done anything differently to save his job, Saunders said: "No. Not really." 
"There's always a few things as a coach, you say you can do better," Saunders said. "But for what was said, where we were at, what we were trying to do, especially this coming year, with the shortened training camp, and maybe the lack of practice time and all the new players we did have." 
Saunders was hired to lead a veteran-laden team into the playoffs, but was eventually forced to develop talent on a team with one of the least experienced rosters in the league, led by former No. 1 overall pick John Wall. 
He chuckled when asked if he felt he was given a good hand in Washington, where his tenure was often overshadowed by off-court incidents - most notably, when all-star Arenas brought guns into the locker room, expediting the rebuilding process. 
"I don't think I imagined at any point in my career that I would be testifying in front of a grand jury 21 / 2 hours before a game. But I looked forward to the opportunity and even though the wins and losses had not been there -  and I've got to take responsibility for that - because basically in the NBA, since the beginning, you can win or develop young players, but it's difficult to do both at the same time."

Vietnam War hero was awarded Medal of Honor

BYLINE: T. Rees Shapiro

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B07

LENGTH: 665 words

John F. Baker Jr., a retired Army master sergeant who was awarded the Medal of Honor during the Vietnam War for rescuing wounded soldiers from an ambush and leading a daring counterassault, died Jan. 20 at a hospital in Columbia, S.C. He was 66.
He had a heart ailment, said his wife, Donnell Baker. 
Standing 5 feet 2 inches tall and weighing 105 pounds, Sgt. Baker made up for his diminutive stature by building up his physique. Inspired by his father's work as a circus trapeze artist, he joined a gymnastics squad in high school and trained on the rings, learning to execute a perfect iron cross.
Accepted by the Army during the Vietnam War - the Marine Corps said he was an inch too short - Sgt. Baker's impressive strength helped him save the lives of his fellow soldiers.
On Nov. 5, 1966, Sgt. Baker's unit was tasked with reinforcing a group of American soldiers pinned down near Dau Tieng, close to the Cambodian border. About 3,000 Vietnamese had taken positions in the surrounding jungle, hiding in underground bunkers and roping themselves to tree branches.
As the U.S. soldiers advanced, the lead scout was shot in the face.
The jungle erupted in enemy fire. Camouflaged machine gun positions spit bullets that whizzed by Sgt. Baker's head. Mortar rounds thumped the ground. Snipers in the trees picked off Americans hiding on the ground.
Sgt. Baker ran toward the front with another soldier and helped destroy two enemy bunkers. During the attack, the other soldier was mortally wounded. Sgt. Baker killed four enemy snipers before carrying his comrade away from the ambush.
Returning to the battle, Sgt. Baker was blown off his feet by an enemy grenade but recovered to make repeated trips through withering fire to evacuate wounded American soldiers much larger than himself. By the end of the two-hour conflict, Sgt. Baker's uniform was soaked in the blood of his comrades.
In all, Sgt. Baker was credited with recovering eight fallen U.S. soldiers, destroying six bunkers and killing at least 10 enemies.
As his Medal of Honor nomination was considered, Sgt. Baker spent the rest of his tour as a "tunnel rat." Armed with a flashlight and pistol, he explored the spider- and scorpion-infested subterranean network used by Viet Cong guerillas. During one mission, he discovered a full-scale hospital complete with surgical suites buried three stories below ground.
Returning home in August 1967, Sgt. Baker served as a drill instructor. One day, he was told he had an urgent phone call. It was President Lyndon B. Johnson on the line, inviting him to the White House to be awarded the Medal of Honor, the military's highest decoration for valor.
According to his citation, "Sgt. Baker's selfless heroism, indomitable fighting spirit, and extraordinary gallantry were directly responsible for saving the lives of several of his comrades, and inflicting serious damage on the enemy."
Joining Sgt. Baker at the ceremony in the East Room was his company commander, then-Capt. Robert F. Foley, who also was awarded the Medal of Honor for bravery during the same battle that November day in 1966.
Foley, who retired from the Army as a lieutenant general in 2000, stood 6-foot-7 and played basketball at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.
Noticing the soldiers' disparate heights, Johnson told Sgt. Baker and Foley that they reminded him of the cartoon characters Mutt and Jeff.
John Franklin Baker Jr. was born Oct. 30, 1945, in Davenport, Iowa, and was raised in Moline, Ill.
After being awarded the Medal of Honor, Sgt. Baker traveled the country as a recruiter. His repeated requests to be sent back to Vietnam for combat duty were denied. He retired from the military in 1989 and later worked at a Department of Veterans Affairs hospital in Columbia, S.C.  
His first marriage, to Ruth Ann Smith, ended in divorce. Survivors include his wife, Donnell Brazil Baker of Columbia; a son from his first marriage, John F. Baker III of Fort Myers, Fla.; and two grandchildren.

Marine won't go to brig for slayings in Iraq

BYLINE: Julie Watson

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A02

LENGTH: 518 words

DATELINE: CAMP PENDLETON, CALIF.

CAMP PENDLETON, Calif. - A Marine sergeant who led a squad that killed 24 unarmed Iraqis in Haditha will spend no time in confinement, despite a military judge's recommendation Tuesday that he spend three months in the brig. 
The military judge, Lt. Col. David Jones, said his hands were tied by a plea agreement that prevents any jail time for Staff Sgt. Frank Wuterich.
Wuterich pleaded guilty to negligent dereliction of duty as part of a deal with prosecutors. The minor charge carried a maximum sentence of 90 days, which is what Jones recommended.
But because of the way the military system works, the terms of the deal with prosecutors weren't known to the judge until after he made his sentencing recommendation in court Tuesday.
Prosecutors asked Jones to give Wuterich, 31, the maximum sentence of three months' confinement, a reduction in rank and forfeiture of two-thirds of his pay.
They said his knee-jerk reaction of sending the squad to assault nearby homes without positively identifying the threat went against his training and led to the deaths of 10 women and children.
"That is a horrific result from that derelict order of shooting first, ask questions later," Lt. Col. Sean Sullivan told the court.
The judge said he would recommend that Wuterich's rank be reduced to private.
He said he decided not to dock his pay because he is the divorced father of three young daughters of whom he has sole custody.
Wuterich has acknowledged ordering his squad to "shoot first, ask questions later" after a roadside bomb took the life of a fellow Marine, but he said he did not shoot any of the 10 women and children killed in nearby homes that he stormed with his men.
"The truth is: I never fired my weapon at any women or children that day," Wuterich told the military judge, who recommended the sentence that must be reviewed by the commander of Marine Corps Forces Central Command.
The surprise contention by Wuterich contradicts prosecutors who implicated him in 19 of the 24 deaths. It also counters testimony from a former squad mate who said he joined Wuterich in firing in a dark back bedroom where a woman and children were killed.
Defense lawyers also said Wuterich has been exonerated of directly causing the deaths of civilians in the two homes and insisted that his only intent was to protect his Marines, calling it "honorable and noble."
"The appropriate punishment in this case, your honor, is no punishment," defense attorney Neal Puckett said.
Wuterich told the court that his guilty plea should not suggest that he believes his men behaved badly or that they acted in any way that was dishonorable to their country. He said that he ordered his men to "shoot first, ask questions later" so they would not hesitate in attacking the enemy but said that he never intended to harm any civilians.
The plea deal that halted Wuterich's manslaughter trial has sparked outrage in Iraq, where many said it proves that the United States does not hold members of its military accountable for their actions. The seven other Marines initially charged were exonerated or had their cases dropped.

Early dismissal

BYLINE: Michael Lee

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. D05

LENGTH: 806 words

For Flip Saunders, trips to Philadelphia were often met with the greatest despair. In his first season as head coach of the _blankWashington Wizards, Gilbert Arenas playfully formed his fingers into guns, mockingly shot his teammates in pregame warmups, and was suspended for the remainder of the season the next day. 
On his final visit, the Wizards were completely outclassed by the 76ers and suffered yet another humiliating loss that hinted at the lack of progress being made on a rebuilding team. Those games offered examples of the problems Saunders could not overcome in a disappointing tenure that finally ended on Tuesday when he met with team President Ernie Grunfeld and was relieved of his duties after a franchise-worst 2-15 start.  
"Flip is a very good, outstanding basketball man," _blankGrunfeld said in a news conference. "I felt like at this time our players were not responding, that I think we needed a different voice." 
Saunders's top assistant, Randy Wittman, becomes the 23rd coach in franchise history and the fourth coach to lead the Wizards since the start of the 2008-09 season. Eddie Jordan was fired after a 1-10 start. Ed Tapscott wasn't brought back after finishing 18-53. And Saunders is gone, after compiling a 51-130 record. Saunders was in the third year of a four-year, $18 million contract he signed in April 2009. 
"I was somewhat surprised, but I've been in the business 17 years. I know what it's about," Saunders said in a telephone interview. "It's always disappointing when your won-loss record isn't there, so changes in this situation are not unusual." 
Saunders's time in Washington was filled with several less than desirable circumstances. He arrived with the seventh-best winning percentage all-time among coaches with at least 900 games and took over what he thought would be a veteran-laden team on the cusp of playoff contention when he returned from a one-year hiatus to coach the Wizards. 
His stated goal was to lead a team that featured an all-star trio in Arenas, Antawn Jamison and Caron Butler to a championship, but his time in Washington took an unexpected turn when team patriarch Abe Pollin died. A month later, Arenas and reserve guard Javaris Crittenton brought guns to the locker room, and were suspended for the remainder of the season. Before news of the dispute became public, the Wizards were blown out at home by Oklahoma City and Saunders famously said, "Don't think it can't get any worse, because it can."
Grunfeld decided to rebuild the team after the incident, dealing away Butler, Brendan Haywood, DeShawn Stevenson and later Jamison and handing the keys to their backups, Andray Blatche, JaVale McGee and Nick Young. The process of rebuilding was aided by the selection of John Wall with the No. 1 overall pick, but the situation would continue to get worse for Saunders, who also lost his mother, Kay, last season. 
Grunfeld believes that Saunders came up short in developing the talent of a roster that features eight players with less than three years of experience. While saying "this is not going to be about wins and losses for us," Grunfeld was disappointed by Wall's uneven play in his second season. Other players have failed to develop chemistry, the offense has sputtered and the team has suffered eight double-digit losses. 
Wittman, who will lead the Wizards against Charlotte on Wednesday at Verizon Center, said Saunders's dismissal is "a black mark on all of us, absolutely . . . Is this a happy day? No, by any regard. A good man walked out the door today, and it's always hard. I didn't come here to Washington to be the coach. I came here to help him."
According to a league source, the Wizards had considered replacing Saunders prior to their game against the Oklahoma City Thunder, but the surprising victory over the top team in the Western Conference wasn't enough to buy him even another week. The Wizards dropped their next three games - including home losses to Denver (which was missing Nene) and Boston (which was without all-star point guard Rajon Rondo, then lost all-star Ray Allen in the second half). 
They lost in blowout fashion to Philadelphia for the third time this season, 103-83, in a sign that players had tuned out Saunders completely. 
The Wizards trailed by 30 points at halftime and late in the second quarter, Saunders pulled Young for taking a questionable shot and benched him at the start of the third period. Saunders criticized Young on the bench and, according to sources, the move angered several players.
"I think it was cumulative," Grunfeld said. The loss to the 76ers "obviously, nobody was happy with, including the players and everybody, but we all felt like it was time for a different voice, and to maybe try to do some different things to take advantage of the talent of the players on the team."

Discipline proposal would limit student suspensions

BYLINE: Donna St. George

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B05

LENGTH: 635 words

Maryland education leaders unveiled a major reform effort Tuesday that could largely end the use of school suspensions for nonviolent offenses and require that the state's 24 districts create plans to address racial disparities in discipline.
Saying thousands of students lose time in class for nonviolent offenses and that punishment falls hardest on minorities and special-education students, James H. DeGraffenreidt Jr., president of the Maryland State Board of Education, presented the outlines of regulatory changes at a board meeting. Formal proposals will be presented in February.
One major concern, he said, is how many students are removed from school for offenses that do not harm others and could be handled another way. He cited data that shows more than half of out-of-school suspensions in Maryland result from infractions such as disrespect, insubordination, failure to follow school rules and cellphone violations. 
Although there is no argument about removing students for violence, DeGraffenreidt said, students generally need to be in class. "There is a very strong correlation . . . between being in class and student achievement," he said, also citing risks of dropout and juvenile justice involvement.
State data also show more than half of suspensions involve African American students, he said. "We think this relates to not only the achievement of individual students but the achievement gap itself," he said.
The state board would prefer to leave specific methods of reducing disparities and suspensions to local school officials, he said, but new regulations will clearly mean a shift in practices across the state.
Among regulatory changes would be a requirement that school systems with identified disparities submit detailed plans to reduce - and over three years eliminate - gaps in suspension rates by race and special-education status.
Districts would also keep more detailed data on suspensions and take corrective action if needed.
For students who get suspended, the decision-making process would be speedier, with a proposed 10-day turnaround for rulings. In nonviolent cases, students would be sent back to school if the process were to drag on.
As part of its rethinking, the board would revise definitions. Short-term suspensions would be three days or less, while long-term suspensions would last up to 10 days. Beyond that, suspensions would be called "extended."
The state proposes to end expulsions, except for such severe violations as firearms possession. 
Other board members echoed DeGraffenreidt's concerns, with Kate Walsh citing the case of a lacrosse player on the Eastern Shore who was ousted from school for carrying a pocket knife in his gearbag, which he said he had used to repair his sticks.
"We understand the need for discipline," said board member Donna Hill Staton, adding that the concern is whether "the punishment fits the crime."
In February, the board will release a detailed report laying out its view of problems with school discipline and its suggested regulatory changes. It will invite public comment afterward.
The proposed reforms come after several high-profile suspension cases. One involved a teen out of school a year for fighting in Maryland, DeGraffenreidt said.
Another came from neighboring Virginia, where a 15-year-old football player who admitted to buying one capsule of a legal drug committed suicide after his suspension went on for seven weeks and ended with a forced school transfer. His story was profiled in The Washington Post and touched off policy changes in Fairfax County.
Advocates lauded Maryland's new direction.
"I thought it was great they made clear that exclusion from school is not appropriate for all but the most violent offenses," said Nicole Joseph, a lawyer with the Maryland Disability Law Center.

After 3 decades, a long line of 'Skutniks'

BYLINE: Ed O'Keefe

LENGTH: 525 words

President Obama's State of the Union address Tuesday night marked the 30th anniversary of the first time a president turned to the rafters of the House gallery and made reference to an everyday American. 
The first American to earn the distinction was a federal employee, Lenny Skutnik, a Congressional Budget Office employee who jumped into the icy waters of the Potomac River in January 1982 to help rescue survivors of the Air Florida Flight 90 crash. 
Ever since Ronald Reagan invited Skutnik to watch his speech two weeks after the crash, presidents have brought along a long list of so-called "Skutniks," or invited guests, to sit with the first lady and help humanize the policies, priorities and personal feelings conveyed by the president.
Moved by Skutnik's heroism, Reagan noted how the crash response had once again demonstrated "the spirit of American heroism at its finest." 
Then Reagan added: "We saw the heroism of one of our young government employees, Lenny Skutnik, who, when he saw a woman lose her grip on the helicopter line, dived into the water and dragged her to safety."
With that, the House gallery burst into a standing ovation, Reagan saluted Skutnik and the gesture became a well-worn bit of presidential stagecraft.
This year, Mark Kelly, the husband of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.), and a former NASA astronaut, and Air Force Col. Ginger Wallace, from McLean, were among the White House guests.
Reagan's other guests included Mother Clara Hale, a Harlem-based activist caring for abandoned children, and Jean Nguyen, a Vietnamese woman who was set to graduate from West Point.
In 1991, George H.W. Bush invited Alma Powell and Brenda Schwarzkopf, the wives of Gens. Colin Powell and Norman Schwarzkopf, who were leading military operations in Iraq. 
Bill Clinton once called out former Reagan press secretary James Brady to help push for gun control laws and in 1996 invited Richard Dean, a Social Security Administration employee who helped rescue victims of the Oklahoma City bombing. In other years, home-run kings Sammy Sosa and Hank Aaron also attended the big speech.
Several of George W. Bush's invited guests had ties to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and antiterrorism operations. In 2002, flight attendants Christina Jones and Hermis Moutardier attended the speech after helping to thwart an attempted bombing by Richard Reid, the so-called "Shoe Bomber." Shannon Spann, the widow of CIA officer Michael Spann, killed in Afghanistan, also attended that year. Several Iraqi human rights activists and the parents, spouses and siblings of slain U.S. service members also attended Bush's speeches.
Tuesday night also marked the public debut of a new high-profile Capitol Hill staffer. 
Paul D. Irving, a former Secret Service agent, was elected last week as the 37th House Sergeant-at-Arms. Irving, who serves as the lead law enforcement and protocol officer for the House, succeeds Wilson Livingood, who retired after 17 years, the second-longest tenure for the position. 
As is tradition, Irving shouted out the familiar call to attention, "Mr. Speaker, the president of the United States."

FBI arrests 4 officers in abuse of Hispanics
Four police officers, including the president of the police union in East Haven, were arrested Tuesday by the FBI on charges that they assaulted illegal immigrants and covered up abuses in a New Haven suburb where a federal investigation found life was made miserable for Hispanics.
According to the federal indictment, the officers assaulted individuals while they were handcuffed, unlawfully searched Latino businesses, and harassed and intimidated individuals, including advocates, witnesses and other officers who tried to investigate or to report misconduct or abuse. 
Federal authorities began investigating police in 2009 in East Haven, where the federal probe last month documented a pattern of abuse. The Hispanic population had doubled in the past decade to more than 10 percent of the city's 28,000 residents, but Latino business owners said rough treatment by police drove away many newcomers from Mexico and Ecuador.
The arrests were welcomed by Hispanic business owners in East Haven.
Officers Dennis Spaulding, David Cari and Jason Zullo, and Sgt. John Miller, president of the police union, are charged with conspiracy, deprivation of rights and obstruction of justice.
All four officers pleaded not guilty Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Bridgeport. Three defendants were released on bond. Zullo was ordered to remain in custody because he wasn't immediately able to post bond.

Christie vows to vetogay marriage bill
Gov. Chris Christie (R) said Tuesday that he would veto a same-sex marriage bill advancing in the legislature and instead wants the measure put to a referendum. Angry Democrats said that lawmakers have an obligation to protect civil rights and that the issue should not be put off for a public vote.
Christie made his first explicit promise to veto a same-sex marriage bill just hours before the Democratic-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee forwarded the measure to the full Senate on an 8-4 party-line vote. "Let the people of New Jersey decide what is right for the state," Christie said.
Same-sex marriage legislation failed in the state Senate two years ago, and Christie's opposition was known when it was again introduced this month.

Gun-smuggling probenets first convictions
Two men pleaded guilty to buying guns that were destined to be smuggled into Mexico, the first convictions in the federal government's botched Operation Fast and Furious.
Jacob Wayne Chambers and Jacob Anthony Montelongo acknowledged buying guns that they knew were headed to Mexican drug gangs.
The goal of the federal investigation was to catch weapons-trafficking kingpins, but firearms agents lost track of many weapons they were trying to trace to smuggling ringleaders, and some guns ended up at crime scenes in Mexico and the United States.

No mistrial after bomb scare: A bomb scare at a bombing trial in Phoenix was enough to disrupt the proceedings but not enough to warrant a mistrial. A judge denied a defense request Tuesday to declare a mistrial in the case against Dennis and Daniel Mahon, two white supremacist brothers, charged with bombing a black city official in Scottsdale.
JFK Library releases tapes: In the final recordings that President John F. Kennedy secretly made in the Oval Office, he is heard telling staffers that Nov. 25 was shaping up to be a "tough day." It turned out to be the date of his funeral. The exchange was among the last 45 hours of private recordings Kennedy made.
Out-of-state donors to Walker's aid: Wisconsin's governor is fighting attempts to recall him with money from out-of-state donors, who helped him bring in more than $12 million since last year. An AP analysis of campaign finance reports that Gov. Scott Walker (R) filed Monday showed 61 percent of the $4.1 million he raised in the five-week reporting period came from out of state.

Workers disciplined for 10-car train
Three Metro employees were disciplined after an incident in which an overly long, 10-car train left the Shady Grove yard Dec. 2, transit officials said.
Station platforms cannot accommodate more than eight cars. The 10-car train managed to service 26 stations along the Red Line, Metro said, but no passengers were in the last two cars.
Dan Stessel, Metro's chief spokesman, said that the three employees were a terminal supervisor, a train operator and an interlocking operator, who is in control of allowing trains out of the rail yard. 
He said the disciplinary actions ranged from unpaid suspensions to "disqualifications from certain positions."

Shooting suspect pleads not guilty
Alleged White House shooter Oscar Ramiro Ortega-Hernandezpleaded not guilty Tuesday to a charge of attempting to assassinate the president and 16 related crimes.
Ortega-Hernandez, 21, of Idaho Falls, Idaho, appeared briefly in U.S. District Court in Washington. After one of his lawyers entered the pleas for him, Ortega-Hernandez was escorted back to jail, where he is being held without bond pending trial.
He allegedly fired rifle shots at the White House from about 750 yards away on the night of Nov. 11. Although President Obama was in San Diego at the time of the incident, Ortega-Hernandez was charged with attempted assassination.

Church wins Prince George's approval
Reaching Hearts International, which wants to build a 900-seat church and a grade school in Laurel, won approval Tuesday for water and sewer rights needed before it can build.
The Prince George's County Council voted 7 to 1 in favor of the church, which won $3.7 million from the county in a lawsuit over the proposed church.
The church still must seek approval from the county's planning board for a detailed plan for the site. The church is seeking legal expenses from the county in a case pending in federal court in Greenbelt.
The council acted after a December ruling by U.S. District Judge Roger Titus found that the county had acted improperly when it turned down the church's request for permission to run water and sewer lines onto its property.

Pastor agrees to plea in molestation case
A Fairfax County pastor accused of molesting two boys in the 1990s has reached a plea agreement with prosecutors.
Under the terms of the agreement, Tommy R. Shelton Jr., 66, who was a minister at Community Church of God in the Dunn Loring area from 1995 to 2000, entered what is known as an Alford plea on four charges in one of the cases, according to court records. Charges in the second case will be dropped.
In an Alford plea, a defendant does not admit guilt but recognizes that prosecutors have enough evidence against him to obtain a conviction.
Fairfax County Circuit Court Judge Brett A. Kassabian is scheduled to sentence Shelton on Feb. 24. Shelton  faces up to five years in prison on each charge.

Fairfax board adopts Tysons guidelines
The Fairfax County Board of Supervisors adopted a sweeping array of guidelines Tuesday for fleshing out proposals for a new urban landscape in Tysons Corner.
The guidelines touch on best practices for aesthetically pleasing and environmentally friendly building designs, signage, paint schemes, street furniture and pocket parks, as Tysons seeks to transform from a suburban crossroads into an urban center.
The guidelines are not binding, but they give developers a better idea of what county planners hope to see when reviewing rezoning applications.

Another example of how D.C. gets the short end of a double standard on Capitol Hill

BYLINE: John Kelly

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B02

LENGTH: 694 words

Arizona's Mohave County has very little in common with Washington, D.C., which, oddly enough, is exactly why I'm sticking them together in the same sentence.
Both jurisdictions - one is home to the Grand Canyon, the other isn't (I'll let you figure out which is which) - were on the agenda Tuesday morning during a hearing of the House Natural Resources subcommitteeon national parks, forests and public lands.
I was at the hearing - in the Longworth Building - to watch testimony on H.R. 938, the House bill that would rededicate the District's World War I memorial as the national World War I memorial. Rep. Ted Poe (R-Tex.), sponsor of the bill, explained how much Frank Buckles - who, before he died, was the nation's last World War I vet - wanted to see the country finally get a memorial to veterans of the Great War. 
Nelson Rimensnyder, a D.C. resident, a veteran and the historian for the Association of the Oldest Inhabitants of D.C., was there to say it's not thenation's memorial, it's the District's, built with donations from District residents, dedicated to District dead. Make Pershing Park the national memorial instead, he said.
Edwin Fountain of the World War I Memorial Foundation was there to say that if Congress decided to back Pershing Park, that would be fine by him, but wouldn't it be better to have the memorial on the Mall, near the other war memorials?
Peter May was there from the National Park Service to say that there are problems with the bill, because Congress has decided that the Mall is essentially "done" and that nothing more may be built there.
And Rep. Emanuel Cleaver II (D-Mo.) was there to make sure people knew that the bill would actually officially create two memorials: The one in the District would be transformed into a national World War I memorial and so would one in his state, Kansas City's Liberty Memorial.
In other words, there's a lot going on.
The effort to nationalize the District's memorial has taken an odd journey. When Edwin Fountain's foundation was first put together, its honorary board of trusteesincluded Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), D.C. Council member Jack Evans and then-council memberVincent Gray. Del. Norton even signed on as a co-sponsor of an earlier bill in support of nationalizing the District's memorial. (This is an example of why it's important to think carefully before joining seemingly innocent honorary boards.)
Over time, largely driven by a D.C. gadfly named Joe Grano, it became a voting rights issue.
This no doubt irritates supporters of the bill. Perhaps it even emboldens them. The District has taken so many lumps at the hands of Congress recently - Guns for everybody! Abortions for nobody! - that this presents yet another opportunity to remind D.C. residents that they are second-class citizens.
Which gets us back to Arizona and another piece of business before the subcommittee on Tuesday: the "Mohave Valley Land Conveyance Act of 2011."
About 10 years ago, some people in northwest Arizona decided that it was getting harder and harder to find a place to shoot their guns. The problem is that with development on the increase it's getting crowded out there. Go out "plunking" and there was a chance your bullet might end up somewhere you didn't want it to. What was needed was a shooting range.
Where to put it? It was decided to transfer to the state of Arizona land currently overseen by the federal Bureau of Land Management. But that particular parcel just happens to be near land that is sacred to members of the Fort Mojave Indians and the Hualapai Indians, who, understandably, don't want the sound of gunfire when they're going about their business. (Of course, the reason given for needing the shooting range - "encroaching development" - pretty much describes our country's treatment of Indians.)
Before the subcommittee got to the D.C. memorial issue, Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.) explained why his bill transferring the land for the shooting range, H.R. 919, was necessary.
My point is, if the citizens of Mohave County are happy with Trent Franks, they can reelect him. If not, they can send him packing.
Who in Washington voted for Ted Poe?

CORRECTION: The John Kelly column in the Jan. 25 Metro section incorrectly said that D.C. Mayor Vincent C. Gray, then a D.C. Council member, was an honorary trustee of the World War I Memorial Foundation. Although Gray signed a council resolution supporting the foundation's aims, he was not an honorary trustee.

Red Crescent official is fatally shot as clashes continue in Syria

BYLINE: Elizabeth A. Kennedy;Zeina Karam

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A13

LENGTH: 820 words

DATELINE: BEIRUT

BEIRUT - The head of the Syrian Arab Red Crescent branch in the northern town of Idlib was fatally shot Wednesday, the International Committee of the Red Cross said, and activists reported deadly clashes elsewhere between government forces and army defectors.
Abdulrazak Jbero was on his way from Damascus to Idlib when he was shot, said Hicham Hassan, an ICRC spokesman in Geneva. An ICRC statement said Jbero was riding in a "vehicle clearly marked with a Red Crescent emblem" and expressed shock at the killing. 
Syria's state-run news media blamed "terrorists" for the attack. President Bashar al-Assad's government has accused terrorists acting out a foreign conspiracy of being behind the country's 10-month-old uprising, not protesters seeking change in one of the region's most autocratic states.
The Syrian revolt, which began in March with largely peaceful protests, has grown increasingly militarized in recent months, as frustrated regime opponents and army defectors arm themselves and fight back against government forces.
On Wednesday, government forces clashed with army defectors and stormed rebellious districts in central Syria, firing mortars and deploying snipers in violence that killed at least seven people, including a mother and her 5-year-old child, activists said.
Pressure on Syria to end months of bloodshed has so far produced few results. Persian Gulf states led by Saudi Arabia have pulled out of the Arab League's observers mission, asking the U.N. Security Council to intervene. 
Decisive action from the United Nations appeared unlikely, however, as Russia, a strong Syrian ally, has opposed moves such as sanctions.
While Syria has approved an extension of the observers' presence for another month, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem signaled Tuesday that the crackdown on protests will continue.
A Syrian military assault near Hama began Tuesday night, according to the Local Coordination Committees, an umbrella group of activists and opposition members. Shells slammed into several districts around Hama's Bab Qebli area, the LCC said.
"It was impossible to rescue the wounded due to the ongoing arbitrary shelling," the group said in a statement.
Two people were killed by sniper fire, according to the LCC and another opposition group, the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
In the town of Qusair near the central city of Homs, a woman and her 5-year-old child were killed when a shell struck their home during clashes between government troops and gunmen believed to be army defectors, both groups said.
Three other people were killed during raids in a Damascus suburb.
The Arab strategy to solve the crisis appears to be collapsing. After announcing their pullout from the observers mission, Persian Gulf Arab countries urged the Security Council to take all "necessary measures" to force Syria to implement an Arab League peace plan announced Sunday to create a national unity government in two months.
Damascus has rejected the plan as a violation of national sovereignty.
The United States, the European Union, the Arab League and Turkey all have introduced sanctions against Damascus in response to Assad's crackdown, but Russia threatens to veto such measures.
Syria informed the Arab League on Wednesday that it had agreed to extend the observer mission one month, until Feb. 24, said Adnan al-Khudeir, a league official in Cairo.
He also said the league has put together a new group of observers to replace the 55 monitors who were leaving Wednesday. They consist of 15 Mauritanians, 10 Palestinians and six Egyptians, and they will head to Syria within a week, he said.
Defectors clashed with government soldiers Wednesday in northern Syria's Idlib province, activists said.
Soldiers siding with a group of anti-regime army defectors known as the Free Syrian Army are also known to be active in Hama, and some in the city said they were the target of the current government assault.
Meanwhile, a 21-year-old who disappeared for three weeks after returning to Syria from suburban Detroit was released by Syrian authorities Wednesday, his family in Michigan said.
Obada Mzaik, a citizen of both the United States and Syria, had flown to Damascus from Detroit on Jan. 3 but wasn't seen leaving an immigration checkpoint.
An uncle in Michigan said the Syrian government released Mzaik to his father Wednesday.
"We're grateful that he's back with his family, and we're grateful to the community for showing support to the family during difficult days," Firas Nashef, a dentist from the Detroit suburb of Farmington Hills, said in a statement.
The State Department said Wednesday night that it did not yet have any information on the release.
Mzaik is a native of Columbus, Ohio, and was planning to study civil engineering at Syria's Al-Yarmouk University. He had been temporarily living in the Detroit area while taking classes at Oakland Community College.

Plea hearing is setin military shootings
The 24-year-old former Marine Corps reservist accused of firing shotsat the Pentagon, the Marine Corps History Museum and other military targets in Northern Virginia is scheduled to appear in federal court Thursday to enter into a plea agreement, according to court records.
Yonathan Melaku, 24, of Fairfax County was charged with destruction of property and firearm offenses in connection with a series of five attacks in October and November 2010. The spree of late-night and early morning shootings did not injure anyone, but prosecutors have alleged that they were part of Melaku's plan to "engage in violent activity against those in the military."  
Federal prosecutors in the Eastern District of Virginia and Melaku's defense attorney declined to comment on what court records indicate is a "plea agreement hearing," scheduled for 11 a.m. Thursday in Alexandria before U.S. District Judge Gerald Bruce Lee. Such hearings generally indicate that an agreement has been reached, although such agreements are not binding until a judge accepts them.
The shootings mystified local, state and federal law enforcement officials, who long thought that a disgruntled member of the armed forces probably was behind them.

Ticket amnesty program ends Friday
If you're sitting on a pile of  unpaid parking tickets issued in Washington, you have until Friday to pay them without late fees - depending on when you received them.
The D.C. Department of Motor Vehicles' ticket amnesty program began in the summer. The program allows drivers pay overdue parking, moving violation and photo-enforcement tickets with no late fee or penalty. The tickets must have been issued before Jan. 1, 2010.
If overdue tickets are not paid during the amnesty window, a late fee will be added back onto the ticket, according to the DMV.
The District has collected more than $3 million through the program, with more than $1.5 million coming from Maryland drivers, the DMV reported this month.
Tickets can be paid online, by  phone (866-893-5023) or in person at DMV Adjudication Services, 301 C St. NW, which is open weekdays from 8:15 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Paying online is the quickest option. The DMV reports that the program's popularity is causing a wait time that could be several hours.

Robbery attempt at elementary school
A man attempted to rob a secretary Wednesday afternoon inside Fort Foote Elementary School in Fort Washington, authorities said.
The incident occurred just after 2:30 p.m. at the school in the 8300 block of Oxon Hill Road, said Cpl. Mike Rodriguez, a Prince George's County police spokesman.
Briant Coleman, a Prince George's schools spokesman, said the man walked in and demanded cash from a secretary who was sitting nearest the door. He said the man left without taking anything.
No one was injured, Rodriguez said.
Briant said students were dismissed from school as normal, and parents would receive a letter about the incident.
Rodriguez said officers were in the area searching for the man. Detectives are investigating whether the man had a weapon or implied he had one.

No fire deaths in 2011 for Fairfax County 
There were no deaths from fires in Fairfax County in 2011. It is the first time in the fire department's 62-year history that it has gone a year without recording a fatality, officials announced.
Officials credited a "multi-pronged effort" that included fire-safety education, fire inspections, a program to distribute smoke alarms for free and quick responses to blazes.
The county, with a population of more than a million residents, averaged more than seven fire deaths annually between 2000 and 2010, according to the fire department.

St. Mary's storyteller publishes eighth book

BYLINE: Jason Babcock

SECTION: METRO; Pg. T17

LENGTH: 762 words

J. Roy Guyther has written his eighth book of stories about St. Mary's County. This one is about how the county has changed, particularly since the Patuxent River Naval Air Station opened in 1943. 
The population of St. Mary's doubled from 1940 to 1950 and has been growing ever since. As of 2010, 101,151 people lived St. Mary's, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
Guyther's "Reminiscences II," published last month, is being sold on a limited basis. At 70 pages, it's a quick read, and it's available for $25 at Apple Basket Antiques in Mechanicsville, the St. Mary's County Historical Society in Leonardtown and Fenwick Street Used Books and Music in Leonardtown.  
In this book, Guyther, 91, a retired physician, tells how the death of a 4-year-old boy led to the creation of St. Mary's Hospital in Leonardtown in March 1912. St. Mary's had no hospital before then, and those suffering from serious medical problems had to board a steamship for the District or Baltimore for treatment. The young child died from a ruptured appendix when he reached the District, underscoring the need for the county to have a hospital of its own.
A chapter called "Prohibition and Moonshine" recounts the seldom-told tale of Charles Gundlach, who was shot and killed in a gunfight with four Prohibition agents on Sept. 16, 1927. Gundlach, a farmer who lived off Brown Road near Leonardtown, was suspected of making illegal whiskey. Gundlach is said to have fired first at the agents; they returned fire and shot him dead on his front porch. The agents were tried for manslaughter in a courtroom outside St. Mary's but were acquitted. 
Guyther said this will probably be his last book.
"I don't think I'll last long enough to write another one," he said.
Because he suffers from a neurological problem, he uses a cane and can't drive anymore, but he still lives on his own. His wife, Elizabeth, is in a nursing home. 
Guyther said he had difficulty getting this most recent book published.
"The book business is fading out of existence now," he said from his Mechanicsville home, which dates to 1871. 
St. Mary's used to be a farming community that also lived off the water. "Now it's a housing area" to support 20,000 jobs at Patuxent River Naval Air Station, he said. 
"When I came here to practice [medicine] in 1951, the population was in the 30,000 range," he said. The 1950 population of St. Mary's was 29,111, a 100 percent increase from the 1940 population, because of the opening of Patuxent River Naval Air Station. 
Guyther was born in Mechanicsville and returned after college at the University of Maryland to open his medical office across the street from his home.
"I brought five physicians to St. Mary's County," he said, including Eugene Guazzo, Leon Berube, Theodore Gill and David Mossman. 
At the time, there were six general practitioners in the county, Guyther said. He has a daughter, a son, four grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. 
Guyther suspended his practice in 1990 after knee surgery and a battle with prostate cancer. He resumed work for a while and retired for good in 1995. 
"When I quit, I had nothing to do, so that's when I started writing," he said. "I just sort of wrote off the seat of my pants." 
His first book, published in 1992, was a history of Charlotte Hall School, which he had attended. He volunteered to compile the history of the institution, which was open from 1774 to 1976. About 1,000 books were distributed, with many of them given away. 
"I give away as many as I sell," Guyther said, adding that he doesn't make a profit from them. 
He then wrote a history of Charlotte Hall and Mechanicsville. He sold about 500 copies of the Mechanicsville history. 
His "Memoirs of a Country Doctor," written in 2000, sold about 600 copies, he said. 
In May 2011, the St. Mary's commissioners gave Guyther a lifetime achievement award for historic preservation for his books.
Gracie Brady, historic preservation planner with the St. Mary's Department of Land Use and Growth Management, said Guyther has left valuable treasures for current and future historians.
"To care enough to write about the history of an area he loves so much benefits the entire community," she said. 
After planners complete the master plan for Lexington Park, Charlotte Hall is next. Guyther's history on Charlotte Hall will be instrumental in developing that plan, Brady said.
Bob Schaller, director of the St. Mary's Department of Economic and Community Development, said of Guyther: "He's a great, folksy writer. I highly respect him. He's one of oursages."

Ramadan introduces measureto lower Dulles Greenway tolls
Del. David Ramadan (R-Loudoun) on Friday introduced a bill in the Virginia House of Delegates that aims to reduce tolls for Dulles Greenway commuters.
House Bill 1246 would authorize the owner of the Dulles Greenway property to lease outdoor advertising space and implement "distance pricing" along the road, with the goal of reducing commuter fees. The measure would require the State Corporation Commission to consider lease revenue in decisions regarding toll pricing, Ramadan said in a statement.
"For too long, Dulles Greenway commuters, including many of my constituents, have been paying tolls that are unfair and too high for the relatively short stretch of road they travel," Ramadan said in the statement. He described the practice as "unfair, because commuters have to pay the full toll, even if they don't travel the whole length of the Greenway. My legislation, if enacted and applied, should make Greenway tolls more realistic, more fair and more affordable for local commuters."  
The bill would not rely on state funding or tax increases, nor would it require substantial costs for the Greenway operator to implement gradual tolls, Ramadan said.

Sterling man, 21, is chargedin police impersonation case
A 21-year-old Sterling man was charged last week in connection with an incident last month in which he allegedly brandished a firearm and held a teenage girl against her will while claiming to be a police officer, the Loudoun County Sheriff's Office said.
Jose L. Rivera-Laboy was arrested last Thursday and charged with kidnapping, use of a firearm and impersonating a police officer, the sheriff's office said.
In the Dec. 14 incident, a 16-year-old girl was walking in the area of East Dartmouth Drive about 4 p.m. when she and a friend were approached by two teenage girls known to the victim and an unknown male, authorities said. The 16-year-old victim had been involved in a previous altercation with one of the two teenagers.
 During the encounter, Rivera-Laboy indicated that he was a police officer and exposed a firearm that he was carrying in his waistband, the sheriff's office said. He later followed the victim's friend into her residence and told the friend's mother that he was a police officer, authorities said.
Rivera-Laboy was taken into custody near his home last Thursday and remained at the Loudoun County Adult Detention, Center, where he was being held without bond, authorities said.

Loudoun seeks suggestions for design of regional park
The Loudoun County Department of Parks, Recreation and Community Services and the Department of Construction and Waste Management have scheduled three design workshops for the Hal and Bernie Hanson Regional Park.
The workshops are intended to give residents a chance to comment on the master planning for the park.
 The first two workshops will be from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m. Feb 1 and 6 at the Dulles South Multipurpose Center, 24950 Riding Center Dr., South Riding. A third workshop will be scheduled later, county officials said.
 The park is planned for a 257-acre parcel on Evergreen Mills Road in the Dulles District.
 The first two workshops will provide an overview of the project and a presentation of current conditions, and will allow residents to give their input on planned recreational features. The workshops will include a presentation of preferred design concepts, based on input from the previous sessions, and further public input on the design.
 For information, call 703-777-0343 or e-mail prcs@loudoun.gov.

In music, healing

DATELINE: COLORADO SPRINGS

COLORADO SPRINGS - After a rocket attack outside Nasiriyah, Iraq, shattered three bones in his spine, Kenneth Sargent's doctors told him he'd spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair.
Sixteen months later, he's walking. And he wants to write a song about it.
Sargent's phone is full of Prince hits. He likes Merle Haggard, too. But he doesn't care whether his song is R&B or country. He just wants it to be about how America doesn't understand its soldiers after a decade of war.
The 41-year-old Army staff sergeant was one of 11 veterans gathered at a plush hotel in this arid mountain town near Fort Carson last weekend to transpose their most difficult memories into music. The four-day camp was hosted by LifeQuest Transitions, a Colorado Springs-based nonprofit organization that helps veterans navigate the uncharted leap from the battlefield to civilian life - and one of the few doing it through the arts. 
On Friday afternoon, Sargent plopped down on songwriter Radney Foster's hotel room sofa and began to talk. About Iraq. About the suffocating heat. About the perpetual anxiety of combat. About the numbness that slowly crept up his legs in the blurry hours after the explosion that broke his back. About the depression that clamped down once he returned home. About the nights he spent laying on piles of dirty laundry in his bedroom closet, hoping to find enough quiet, enough darkness to sleep through his nightmares.
Foster and Darden Smith, two esteemed songwriters who have been involved with the camp since its inception, listen closely. As Sargent lets the words spill, they pick them up, assign them a shape, a melody, bending them into rhyme. 
Ninety minutes later, they've finished "It Is What It Is," a song about a soldier finally embarking on the homeward journey that he's long anticipated - but in a medevac helicopter. 
"These dog tags on my belt loop," Foster sings, "remind me I'm still alive."
The puddles that have been building in Sargent's eyes spill over. "This is the first time I've heard myself speak," he says. "It's like I'm hearing myself talk."
He slips out the sliding glass door, onto the hotel patio. Smith and Foster set down their guitars and follow him outside. As the afternoon sun sinks into the Rocky Mountains, Sargent crushes his Marlboro underfoot and exhales.
"I'm healing myself through you guys," he says.
According to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, more than 13 percent of post-Sept. 11, 2001, veterans were unemployed last month, compared with 8.5 percent for the country. Veterans account for 20 percent of suicides in America, even though veterans make up 7 percent of the overall population. And according to the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, the divorce rate among service members increased from 2.6 percent in 2001 to 3.6 percent in 2010.
LifeQuest started its music camp as part of its overall effort to help fight the reality those figures represent. The participants that they've invited are men and women, ages 26 to 56, from the Army, Air Force and Marines. Most are grappling with post-traumatic stress. Some have suffered traumatic brain injuries. Two will return to duty this year. All are continuously adapting to a home that feels otherworldly after years in combat.
The organization got its start by helping wounded veterans regain control of their bodies. As many as 300 veterans visit LifeQuest's 12,000-square-foot physical training facility each day, working to rebuild their strength, flexibility and coordination. Some train for competitions, while others want to be able to pick up their kids and put on their own socks. Sargent's experiences at the LifeQuest facility got him out of his wheelchair. 
C.W. Conner, the 50-year-old Army vet who co-founded LifeQuest more than two years ago, approached Smith in 2010 to write a theme song for LifeQuest to help promote the organization's work. Smith asked if, instead, he could collaborate with some of the veterans in Conner's program. Conner agreed. 
So the Austin-based songwriter invited his Nashville songwriting pals Foster and Jay Clementi - both of whom have plenty of country hits under their buckled belts - to last summer's camp in Beaver Creek, Colo. This year, songwriter Georgia Middleman joins the cast, and the four are paid a small stipend for their work. 
While LifeQuest is one of many military nonprofits working to help transition veterans, its music camp makes it somewhat unusual. 
"The military tends to be a hyper-macho world that stereotypically would look down on writing or painting or music," says Matt Gallagher, a senior fellow at IAVA who has hosted creative-writing workshops for veterans. "But with these wars ending, I think we'll see an increase of young veterans channeling their experiences into art."
Rebecca Stinsky, a Marine who participated in last year's music camp, says it provided her with a rare emotional outlet. "You didn't want your family to know that you were flying a helicopter that caught fire. And when you talk with your friends, you make light of it," she says over the phone from Lexington, Ky. "So it was kind of the first time where I started spilling out random bits and pieces of things I remembered and things I saw."
Smith says that's the point. "What we're trying to do is to get them to write songs about the deepest, darkest parts of themselves. But these people are trained to not access that," he says. "It's about creating that safe place where they can open up and unload. . . . When you turn the mirror backward, they realize the power of their stories."
At breakfast on Saturday, Clementi click-clacks lyrics into his laptop while Army Sgt. Tyler Daly, 26, and Army Lt. Col. Pat Marques, 44, turn the tablecloth into a battle map. 
A plate of sliced honeydew becomes a bunker. The glass of grapefruit juice is a tower. A coffee cup is a Bradley, the infantry vehicle both men spent hours in, wondering what might happen when the gate drops open. A few hours later, they have a song about war zone adrenaline and the punishing withdrawal that sets in back home.
Each day starts this way. The veterans split off in groups with the songwriters for sessions that last about three hours. Smith, Foster, Clementi and Middleman gently ask hard questions, then turn these soldiers' unfathomable memories - innocent children killed in firefights, the makeshift bomb that took your friend's life instead of yours, the guilt that refuses to let go - into verses and choruses. 
Marques remembers the agonizing decision of having to take a critically wounded soldier off life support. John C. Buckley III, 56, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel, reflects on the pain and pride of sending a son off to Iraq and the joy of having him return. Marine Cpl. Angel E. Gomez, 26, recounts his struggle to regain his sight, speech and ability to walk after an explosion left him with a traumatic brain injury. Air Force Senior Airman Jennifer Stone, 30, talks about suffering post-traumatic stress not from combat, but from the two bullets that struck her in a drive-by shooting while she was home in Denver between deployments.
There's an unshakable pride that courses through all of these stories, as well as an altruism that manifests as an allergy to the first person. As lyrics get ironed out, the veterans often push the songwriters to change the "I"s into "we"s. 
Army Staff Sgts. Nicholas Denning, 30, and John Wall, 29, seem particularly conscious of this as they chip away at a tune with Foster called "Faded Glory." Denning wants it to express the survivor's guilt felt by anyone who has lived through war. He comes up with a few rhyming couplets and tosses them to Foster like he's pitching batting practice.
"Like the colors left out in the rain," Denning reads from his spiral notebook, "all my heart knows is pain." 
"You're pretty good at this," Wall says.
"I got issues," Denning says.
Everyone laughs.
Prepping for the Sunday night concert that will close out the camp, Clementi and Air Force Staff Sgt. Stacy Pearsall, 32, want to tell a different kind of story. "When we did this thing last year, it was like people were ready to get in the fetal position," Clementi tells her. "We gotta switch it up."
They decide on something funny, upbeat and a little steamy - because, in addition to being forbidden, romance is tricky business in a combat zone. 
Clementi wants details. "Well," Pearsall says, "phone sex is impossible when you've got five people behind you trying to use the phone." 
Between giggles, the duo settle on a melody and the song evolves into a story about two soldiers trying to keep a red-hot romance on the hush. They call it "Silent Partners."
It's the lightest tune written all weekend, but it's still rooted in struggle. Pearsall, who experienced war at its ugliest as a combat photographer, feels the projection of invincibility demanded in military culture is multiplied exponentially for women.
"I think you try very hard not to be identified as a woman, all you really want to do is be your occupation," she says. "You spend so much time fighting that title, it becomes a persona. And part of that persona is to be tough and close off your emotions. . . . It's counterproductive to the healing process. These layers of emotions are stacked on top of each other, and it all starts to erode from the bottom."
She also knows how cathartic songwriting can be. Pearsall and Wall attended last summer's camp and have spent this weekend helping other participants unlock their memories.
And while a program such as this can touch only a dozen individuals at a time, the hope is that the music will reach thousands more. In the coming months, Smith, Foster, Clementi and Middleman plan to reconvene in a Nashville recording studio to put some of these songs on tape. They'll eventually be released on iTunes, alongside the six-song EP that resulted from last summer's camp. The veterans each get a songwriting credit and will earn royalties from the sales. And while the first EP has sold only a few hundred copies, Smith and Foster plan to try and peddle a few of these tunes to big-name artists in their milieu. Foster says he can hear Brad Paisley tackling "It Is What It Is."
Foster sings it at Sunday night's concert with gusto, along with a dozen other songs he and his colleagues helped pen over the weekend. 
"Faded Glory" sparks an audience singalong. "Silent Partners" earns try-not-to-spit-out-your-iced-tea laughs. The evening is a disorienting swirl of exhaustion and uplift, its emotional gravity pulling in every direction.
When Foster belts "It Is What It Is" in his West Texas twang, Sargent stands toward the back, mouthing along.
I've been counting days backwards,
Till I get back home.
A soldier goes where he's told to,
Till he gets the job done.
Filming the performance with a camera in his right hand, Sargent raises a thumbs-up with his left.
He'll return to duty in 35 days.

Hinckley deceptive, isolated, expert says

BYLINE: Katherine Driessen

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B03

LENGTH: 488 words

Presidential assailant John W. Hinckley should not get more freedom from his psychiatric hospital, because of his pattern of deception, isolation and problematic relationships with women, an expert testified Wednesday.  
Psychiatrist Raymond Patterson, a witness for the government, said some of Hinckley's privileges during trips to visit his mother in Williamsburg should be cut. Hinckley's family and St. Elizabeths Hospital staff members say his mental health has improved and are asking a federal judge to expand his privileges. 
Hinckley, 56, has been a patient at the D.C. mental hospital since he was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the shooting of President Ronald Reagan and three other men in 1981.
Under a 2009 judicial order, Hinckley is permitted to visit his mother in Williamsburg for 10-day stretches.
Patterson spent much of Wednesday's hearing detailing Hinckley's history of jumping between relationships with women and "delusional" assumptions about their interest in him. 
Hinckley shot and injured Reagan in 1981 in an attempt to impress actress Jodie Foster, with whom he was obsessed. Patterson said Wednesday that a dental resident at the hospital accused Hinckley of stalking her.
"His judgment just is off," Patterson said. 
Hearings on Hinckley's mental health started last month, with hospital personnel and family members saying that Hinckley's psychotic condition is considered in remission. The hospital wants the court to allow Hinckley visits with his mother for as long as 24 days and eventual permanent discharge as an outpatient living with her in Williamsburg.
Patterson advised against extended release for Hinckley. The presidential assailant gets several blocks of unsupervised time during his Virginia trips. Patterson said those should be curtailed because he cannot be trusted to to speak honestly about how he spends the time. 
His testimony followed that of Secret Service agents who said Hinckley went to a bookstore and seemed to fixate on shelves containing titles about presidents and assassinations. He didn't see a movie he was supposed to see on one of those days and then told hospital staff members he enjoyed it. 
"That is what Mr. Hinckley does," Patterson said. "He tells people things, and you don't know when he is lying."
Hinckley has also failed to take advantage of opportunities for socialization during his visits to Virginia, Patterson said. Although he takes walks in his mother's neighborhood and browses a bookstore, Hinckley has not followed up on suggestions to join a mental health group or go to functions at his mother's church. 
"There is concern that Mr. Hinckley could become isolated and could become more depressed and psychotic," Patterson testified.
Hinckley's lawyers will cross-examine Patterson Monday when hearings resume. U.S. District Court Judge Paul L. Friedman can issue an opinion at any point after the hearings conclude.

Going Out Guide's family movie reviews

BYLINE: Jane Horwitz

SECTION: WEEKEND; Pg. T37

LENGTH: 950 words

PG-

13
MAN ON A LEDGE. Teens may lose patience with this irritatingly contrived, oddly miscast crime thriller long before it's over. A preoccupied mystery man books a room in a New York  hotel, has a nice meal, then steps out onto the window ledge. He won't say much to a police negotiator and demands a female negotiator who's in disgrace. She and her colleagues learn that the man has a history with the NYPD, has escaped from prison and is determined to prove his innocence. 
THE BOTTOM LINE: The action features fights and shootouts but little intensity or gore. Characters drink and smoke and use mild profanity. One character wears revealing outfits and engages in mild sexual innuendo. 
Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close.ג[#x20ac][#x201a]Teens who respond to strong drama and historic events will embrace this quirky film about the emotional fallout of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Based on the novel by Jonathan Safran Foer, Oskar Schell (extraordinary newcomer Thomas Horn) is a brilliant, anxiety-plagued 11-year-old trying to absorb the fact that his dad, Thomas, died in the attacks. Oskar adored his father, and now, a year after 9/11, can't open up to his grieving mother. He has found a key in his father's closet in an envelope with the name "Black" on it and decides that finding what lock it fits is crucial to his peace of mind.
THE BOTTOM LINE: The movie explores how children and adults deal with grief. It has images both real and stylized of the burning World Trade Center towers and of falling bodies. While intense and upsetting, the images are not graphic. The script includes occasional crude language and midrange profanity. 
THE IRON LADY. It's unlikely that teens or even most college students, except perhaps history and poli-sci majors, will have much interest in this unusual, rather apolitical study of Britain's first female prime minister, Margaret Thatcher. Many will squirm through its stately pace. Teens interested in the finer points of acting, however, can delight in Oscar-nominated Meryl Streep's infinitely detailed embodiment of the grande dame. Told from the point of view of a widowed and ever more distracted Thatcher, the film will disappoint those who want more of a critique of her policies. Instead they get her history in fragmented flashbacks. 
The bottom line: The film includes frightening reenactments of Irish Republican Army bombings, as well as occasionally violent anti-Thatcher demonstrations and strikes. There are archival shots of war violence and brief toplessness. A central theme is Thatcher's slow descent into dementia. Some characters drink and smoke. 

R
THE GREY.  Based on a short story by Ian Mackenzie Jeffers, who wrote the script with director Joe Carnahan, "The Grey" feels like a throwback to a Jack London adventure in which men test their mettle against whatever nature throws at them. Kids 15 and older with strong stomachs will find it mighty enthralling. Terrifically acted and handsomely made, "The Grey" is both a thriller and a dark night of the soul for a tough group of men, led by John Ottway, a sharpshooter who protects an oil-drilling crew in Alaska from wolves. Ottway has a Captain Ahab-like obsession with the beasts. The movie isn't for kids younger than high school age, but it's an unusually cool piece of work. 
THE BOTTOM LINE: The wolf attacks themselves are not highly graphic, but the foreboding leading up to them and the size of the animatronic and computer-animated creatures - yellow eyes, huge teeth - make the attacks feel graphic. And the views of the mutilated victims are graphic. The action includes a harrowing plane crash, gunplay and fist fights. Characters drink and use strong profanity. Themes of suicide, loss of faith and an existential sense of nothingness weave throughout. 
UNDERWORLD AWAKENING. High-schoolers who enjoy vampire sagas of a more violent strain than the "Twilight Saga" films will have plenty to chew on in "Underworld Awakening." The melding of live action and special effects, subtly intensified in 3-D, works handsomely, but the violence is too gory for middle-schoolers. In a prologue, the three previous films are summarized, but the new film is still tough to follow. The vampire heroine Selene recalls how she was captured while trying to save her human/Lycan (werewolf) lover from humans. She was frozen for 12 years and escaped from a lab. An even more deadly form of werewolf has evolved and escaped annihilation. Selene impales, beheads, kicks and chops her way to the truth of what occurred.  
THE BOTTOM LINE: The special-effects-enhanced violence includes beheadings, impalings, bone-splinterings and head-bashing fights. The references to genocidal "cleansing" of the "non-humans" are disturbing references to recent human history. One scene includes implied nudity, and there is very occasional profanity. 
HAYWIRE. An intriguing, elliptically told tale of international intrigue spiked with martial-arts mayhem, "Haywire" will appeal to high-school-age fans of action and spy thrillers. It contains little profanity or sex but is too intensely violent for middle-schoolers. Directed by Steven Soderbergh with his trademark off-center approach, the film stars female mixed-martial-arts champion Gina Carano as Mallory Kane, who works for a government contractor that does "black ops" work. Following the plot is like searching for a landscape in an abstract painting.  
THE BOTTOM LINE: The fights play out in bone-shattering detail, though action sequences with gunplay and chases are more stylized than graphic. There's rare profanity and one steamy kiss with the start of undressing, but the film cuts away.

gDER SCHAUSPIELDIREKTOR AND MONSIEUR CHOUFLEURI RESTERA CHEZ LUI LE . . .
At the Jewish Community Center of Greater Washington through Sunday and the Embassy of Austria on Thursday
The Bel Cantanti Opera Company is one of a number of local groups relying on a mix of semi-pros, volunteers and advanced students to mount charming, low-budget, high-energy productions at various out-of-the way venues in the region. The group recently opened a run of a double bill, Mozart's "Der Schauspieldirektor" and Jacques Offenbach's "Monsieur Choufleuri restera chez lui le . . ." With scarce resources, the company was apparently unable to muster much in the way of publicity; the audience at a recent show barely outnumbered the 21 cast members and musicians. But an entertaining evening of fine singing at a third of the price you would pay at the Kennedy Center should draw many more. Everyone gave their all, the music was delightful, the sets and staging were entertaining, and the vitality of the art form continued to inspire and transport.

THE GALLERIST
At Atlas Performing Arts Center through Feb. 19
So, was the comely Selena Featherstone possessed by a pygmy capuchin monkey named Iago? Not the sort of question one wrestles with on a typical night out. But then "The Gallerist" strives mightily to avoid any contact with the typical. A fusion of gothic horror, Freudian intrigue and lesbian romance, Fengar Gael's drama, in a world premiere by Rorschach Theatre, is tantalizingly oddball, though it would seem to require a more effervescent treatment than director Catherine Tripp's often muted approach allows. Selena's modern-day descendant, the seriously creepy Bertram Plover, narrates the story of Selena from a New York jail cell. A century earlier in London, Selena's mother beseeches Selena's cousin Laura to allow Selena to live with her after Selena massacres a roomful of her family's pet birds. Laura, an artist who's ditched by her snooty art-critic boyfriend after he decides she's talentless, takes Selena in and begins to paint the birds Selena describes from memory - paintings that will end up in Plover's hands 100 years on. Louise Schlegel and Blair Bowers have by far the most demanding roles, made trickier by the scenes in which Selena, in "Exorcist" style, must seem to spew Iago's verbal bile. They both hold their own in a promising piece that manages to go out on a limb and yet still feels as if it could be allowed to venture out a little bit further.

gLA CAGE AUX FOLLES
At the Kennedy Center Eisenhower Theater through Feb. 12
Christopher Sieber and George Hamilton, who play a lovingly bickering (un)married couple headlining and running a risque Riviera nightclub, form an appealing comic union. As dashing major-domo Georges, the 72-year-old Hamilton manages to shelve for the occasion the self-regarding rake of old and to portray with charm and dignity the cooler-headed half of a gay couple. Sieber has the requisite big presence for Albin, an old-line drag star. The musical tends to go all mushy, especially in the handling of Albin's rejection by the boy he and Georges raised, Jean-Michel, on the day Jean-Michel is bringing home for the first time his fiancee, her timid mother and homophobic politician father. There are some bona fide lump-in-the-throat moments, courtesy of Sieber and the authentic emotional dive Albin takes after the champagne bubble of his maternal role is initially burst, and Jean-Michel says he doesn't want Albin at the dinner with his fiancee and her parents. Hamilton's lightness of being is an aid here, as he winningly conveys the notion of a man trying to juggle the loyalties in his life while maintaining a sense of Gallic bonhomie. And the overall fitness of this touring version reinforces "La Cage's" place in musical theater as a melodic homage to families of all stripes.

gTHE SNOWY DAY
At Glen Echo Park Adventure Theatre through Feb. 12
It's no surprise that this musical, making its world premiere, turns out to be a different creature from Ezra Jack Keats's Caldecott Medal-winning picture book. Writer David Emerson Toney and composer-lyricist Darius Smith ratchet up Peter's boisterousness quotient and pair him with some quirky acquaintances, including a snow pirate, an anxious snowman and an acrophobic bird who's fond of succotash. With these eccentric companions, the boy plunges into a few mild adventures and a Caribbean-flavored dream. It's a storyline that may strike adult ticketholders as somewhat arbitrarily plotted, but younger audiences will find the production both funny and enthralling. Widely recognized as the first picture book to feature a black child as the central character, Keats's classic featured eye-catching gouache-and-collage illustrations. Echoes of that art show up in the musical. All in all, the play's humor and tunefulness are less satisfying than the picture book's mood of quiet wonder, but the book will always be there for re-reading.

THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA
At Lansburgh Theatre through March 4
The Shakespeare Theatre Company's entertaining but over-the-top "The Two Gentlemen of Verona" wastes no time coming at you. PJ Paparelli's production of Shakespeare's comedy about double-crossing friends opens in a fast-food parking lot with teenagers engaging in binge drinking. Yes, it's a comedy: The play has two clowns and a dog, and the lovers and friends spend a lot of time swapping witty repartee. But the emotional switchbacks are sharp, and the play's sudden ending threatens real violence. If the show doesn't quite click, it's largely because of its cineplex-style use of U2 tunes and firearms. Music is oxygen in this milieu, of course, but some of the songs are so painfully on the nose as to be eye-rolling. There are "Glee"-spirited moments that will make you laugh, but that's offset by the sense of applying an easy pop patch where the characters or story seem reluctant to fly. But the big test of how you feel about this lively "Two Gents" is how you respond to its violence. Some of the chase scenes and scuffles are fabulous, but this weaponized show repeatedly pushes its kids to extreme moments of despair and self-damage with razors and pistols, making this play darker and more disturbing. In his last plays, Shakespeare used magic and an expansive spirit to make us accept crazy tales. For the rougher "Two Gents," Paparelli gets it done at gunpoint.

A COMMEDIA ROMEO & JULIET
At Flashpoint through Feb. 4
You never noticed the yuks in "Romeo and Juliet's" graveyard scene? Well, Matthew R. Wilson, who heads the commedia dell'arte-focused Faction of Fools Theatre Company, is one up on you. As director and co-adapter of the company's cheerfully rough-hewn play, Wilson seizes on and spins a couple of Shakespeare's lines, with the result that poignant suspense becomes slapstick. The schtick exemplifies the flavor of this scrappy production, which delivers its largely irreverent humor lickety-split while commenting on entwining influences in classical art. Unfolding against black curtains, the stage business pivots around a huge trunk. At a recent performance, however, the trunk repeatedly malfunctioned, forcing the actors to fiddle with it while ad-libbing. They handled the situation with winking aplomb. Of course, such ad-libbing arguably smacks of commedia technique, as does the capering, roughhousing physicality the actors display throughout the play.

gAMELIA, A STORY OF ABIDING LOVE
At Mount Vernon Place United Methodist Church Undercroft Theatre through Feb. 12
A corner of the Civil War comes vividly to life in this Washington Stage Guild production, which is about as far from cutting-edge theater as you can get. It is, instead, a trip back in time powered by good words, deft acting and clear direction. With his crystalline staging of the play, Artistic Director Bill Largess does extremely well by actor/playwright Alex Webb. Only two actors populate the small stage - Shirleyann Kaladjian as the title character, and Webb as everyone else. In one sense, the play is a showcase for Webb's chameleon-like acting skills. But tour de force showcase or not, Webb has written a lovely script and found a feisty acting partner in Kaladjian, to whom he is married in real life. She's all sharp edges and strong opinions - a steely 1861 Pennsylvania farm girl whose refusal to flirt or flatter could doom her to spinsterhood. It is her luck and her tragedy that she finds love. Then war breaks out, and her man joins up. Clad in the uniform of a dead Union soldier, Amelia slogs southward to find him, even letting herself be taken prisoner. "Amelia" is a rather staid piece of theater, and its final scene loses an emotional coup de grace by ending too quickly. Yet the Stage Guild's handsome production is highly affecting overall.

GLEAM
At Centerstage through Feb. 5
The tale centers on the story's heroine, Janie, and her rough journey through three husbands in backwater Florida beginning at age 16. Visually, the production is spare but crisp as a storybook. It sets the stage for tall tales and heightened acting, led especially by Axel Avin Jr. and Brooks Edward Brantly. Avin plays Jody Starks, the second husband who triumphs over Eatonville, and he's equally compelling as the seducer who lures Janie away from her geezer first husband and as the cad who merely wants to show off the famously pretty Janie. Brantly is a charmer as Tea Cake, the free spirit who turns out to be Janie's deepest, truest partner. He and Christiana Clark's Janie ease into each other wonderfully as the characters meet in Janie's store; they have a formality that adds a lovely tension to the budding romance. As Janie, Clark grows declamatory now and then, but she mainly stays in tune with the slow-burning soul of Janie's long, adventurous trip, which puts a painful kick in the tale's tragic climax.

gHAIRSPRAY
At Signature Theatre through Feb. 5
The production is zippily paced and highly kinetic, thanks in part to witty choreography. Evoking and building on 1960s dance fads, choreographers Karma Camp and Brianne Camp have created a body of capering, whimsically gestural movement that epitomizes the youthful ebullience of Tracy Turnblad (Carolyn Cole) and her peers. "Hairspray" is a Cinderella story in which the fairy godmother is dance, while the ready-to-blossom scullery maids include Tracy, her plus-size mother, Edna, and, oh, yes, 1962 Baltimore. When Tracy's high-spirited hoofin' earns her a slot on "The Corny Collins Show," she finds herself struggling to reform the televised dance program's racially segregated format. It would be a plus if she could also snag the affection of teenage dreamboat Link Larkin. The cast is hard to fault, from Cole (who can nail a song, as well as a bit of shtick) right down to the accomplished ensemble.

THE RELIGION THING
At Theater J through Sunday
Renee Calarco is onto something when she suggests in her new play that America's biggest taboo is talking about faith. Now, if Calarco would only trust her premise and cut some of the clunkier conceits in this overreaching effort, she might see her way clear to a taut, provocative satire. Calarco concerns herself with two Washington couples. Mo, a lawyer, and Brian, a lobbyist, are so out of religious sync that, because she's Catholic and he's Jewish and neither is willing to give any ground, they've held off having kids, to Mo's despair. Patti, a lawyer and lifelong friend of Mo's, is masquerading as born-again to hold onto her new love interest, yet another lawyer, Jeff. The recounting of their spiritual conjoining, revealed to a stunned Brian and Mo, sets up some of the play's funniest revelations. It's disappointing when the playwright undermines her story with a series of coarse, sketch-comedy vignettes that purport to be the cathartic dreams and/or hallucinations of the four main characters. Even the carousel set reinforces the cumulative sense on this evening that we, like the characters of "The Religion Thing," are doomed to go around in circles.

gTIME STANDS STILL
At Studio Theatre through Feb. 12
Why is it that a loving relationship is more apt to withstand bombs than the dormant aftermath? Playwright Donald Margulies poses this question in the steadily engrossing drama performed with the polish of a splendidly synchronized string quartet. The four actors at director Susan Fenichell's keenly realized command apply a completely convincing varnish to the framework of Margulies's story about two journalists returning from harrowing stints in Iraq. James has come home with shattered nerves: The nomadic life of a war correspondent has lost its romance for him. Sarah, a widely admired war photographer, returns gravely injured after a roadside bombing. But she is not, apparently, cured of the job's adrenaline rush. Therein lies the central tension. The play dances on the edge of James's and Sarah's bottled anger, especially as they're forced to confront the warmer, cozier love between their magazine editor and his new, dewy girlfriend. The evening's solid state reaffirms a perception that what Studio puts on its stages these days is all aspiring - and often coming close to - a gold standard.

Another 10-car trainenters Metro service
Metro is designed to accommodate eight-car trains, but the transit authority has disclosed two recent incidents involving trains with 10 cars.
Earlier this week, Metro revealed that three employees had been disciplined in a Dec. 2 incident that began at Shady Grove. However, Deputy General Manager Dave Kubicek said Thursday morning that a second incident happened Jan. 13 near the Largo station. The train went "a couple of stops and was caught," Kubicek said. The two extra cars had no passengers, he said.
A train operator and an interlocking operator, who is in control of allowing trains out of rail yards, were disciplined, he said. One worker received unpaid time off and the other was demoted.

'Kings Dominion' lawsurvives challenge
A Virginia Senate committee gave a victory to the state's tourism industry and a defeat to Gov. Robert F. McDonnell (R) on Thursday by killing three bills that would have repealed a state law setting the first day of school after Labor Day.
Kings Dominion Amusement Park and other tourist destinations had a win in the state Senate Education and Health Committee, where bills for an earlier start to the school year died. The legislation would have nixed the "Kings Dominion" law that passed nearly 30 years ago at the behest of a tourism industry eager for more late-summer visitors.
The Senate committee action followed testimony from a string of tourism representatives who said that moving the first day of school before the holiday weekend would hurt the industry.
McDonnell has made repeal of the Kings Dominion law a priority of his education agenda.

Powering up to revamp games

BYLINE: Mark Jenkins

SECTION: STYLE; Pg. C08

LENGTH: 1062 words

Devotees of Hollywood movies complain about the mysteries of art films, yet it's remarkably easy to twist straightforward storytelling into an arty enigma. That's what Jonathan Monaghan does to an utterly mainstream and generally simple-minded narrative form: the video game. His "Sacrifice of the Mushroom Kings," an eight-minute video screening continuously at the Curator's Office gallery, cryptically repurposes characters and elements from "Street Fighter," "G.I. Joe" and "Super Mario Bros."
Monaghan, a recent University of Maryland MFA who had a related video in Conner's "Academy 2011" show in the fall, grew up playing some of these games. And his skills with 3D Studio Max software could earn him a career at Pixar or some maker of bland, computer-generated entertainment. But Monaghan's video shorts owe less to "Toy Story" than to film artist Matthew Barney, who turns his obsessions into elaborately staged scenarios. Both men's work is epic yet private, a dreamlike procession of borrowed images that critique shopworn notions of luxury, power and manhood. 
Although his visual style is pure Nintendo, Monaghan interjects things from outside the vid-game universe. The locations include Princess Peach's castle, but also New York's old-money Metropolitan Club and an opera house that doubles as a bull ring. A cheesy, "SportsCenter"-style fanfare alternates with passages from Bizet's "Carmen," and a busty superheroine shares the non-story with the image of a delicate Renaissance beauty. Solemn images of royalty contrast with goofy, Disney-style birds and fishes, and the parallel worlds of boys' and girls' video games disconcertingly collide. In one scene, the hyper-muscled warriors find themselves in a hair salon and have no choice but to get a shampoo. The power of the video-game designer is supreme, even when - as in the case of "Sacrifice of the Mushroom Kings" - the designer has clearly lost the thread of "Street Fighter's" macho logic.

Jordi Socias
Surveying about four decades of photographs, "Maremagnum" is a tribute to Barcelona-born Jordi Socias, but also to photography. Socias's pictures show a film-noir taste for night and shadow, wet streets and glistening metal. Enlarged to poster size, and sometimes mounted on lightboxes, the prints on display at the Mexican Cultural Institute are visceral and rough-textured. They glory in the graininess that was once evidence of photos made in low light or on the move.
A self-taught shooter, Socias began as a co-founder of Agencia Popular, which reported news that the Franco regime censored. "Maremagnum" means maelstrom, and some of the photographer's earlier images depict struggle and protest. One gallery in this show - one that uses lightboxes - is all news photos, caught on the street or from above, looking down at the tumult. Yet Socias also took time for more artfully composed work, including female nudes, travel scenes (Britain, Cuba, Texas) and wry jokes, both visual and verbal. There's a self-portrait with a bear, a low-angle shot of a traffic-clogged street that's titled "Autofocus" and a picture that exploits perspective to make it appear that London is being menaced by a massive pigeon.
As Spain became more peaceful and prosperous, Socias turned to portraits, notably of actors, authors and film directors. A whole wall is stacked with such images, ranging from Martin Amis to Penelope Cruz. (Pedro Almodovar is also in the show, of course, but not in this array.) The photographer still shoots mostly in black and white, but there are three color portraits: John le Carre in a bright red sweater, Roman Polanski in a bright red shirt and Francis Ford Coppola with a black-and-white cat. Socias may be primarily a newsman, but he has an artist's sense of pictorial humor.

Ikuo Hirayama
In the first half of the 19th century, such artists as Hokusai and Hiroshige traveled Japan, which they were forbidden by law to leave, depicting scenic views with compositional verve that's rarely been rivaled. After American ships forced foreign influences into the country, Japanese art became Westernized, although such subsequent printmakers as Ikuo Hirayama are still classified as exponents of "Nihonga" (literally, "Japan pictures"). "Road of Destiny: Ikuo Hirayama's Silk Road," at the Japan Information and Culture Center's elegantly appointed new location, shows a widely traveled artist whose destination was always back where he started.
Born near Hiroshima in 1930, Hirayama depicted the A-bomb attack that he survived. But he's probably best known for his Silk Road works, which track the route Buddhism took to his country. Made between 1979 and 1991, the 17 etchings, silkscreens and woodblock prints in this exhibition include scenes of Turkey, Pakistan, India and China. The bulk of the work,  however, portrays temples and their environs in three venerable Japanese locations: the ancient capitals of Nara and Kyoto, and the Buddhist refuge atop Mount Koya. Just one of these works, "Woman in Red (Morning on the Ganges)," focuses on a human figure.
Hirayama, who died in 2009, uses traditional Western viewpoints to frame his subjects. Whether the artist is contemplating the Taj Mahal or Nara's Toshodaiji, the building is at or near the center of the work, observed straight-on. If Hirayama lacks the sly perspectives of his 19th-century predecessors, he boasts colors that are far bolder. This show features richly saturated hues, heavy on nighttime tones but also including bright yellow and orange skies to highlight, respectively, China's Great Wall and a traditional boat off the coast of Vietnam. Hirayama was unafraid of vivid colors, yet his depictions of Japan show it subtly illuminated by moonlight or cloaked in shadows cast by tall trees. These Zen-like images depict a country that was transformed by Buddhism but that also transformed it.

Guilty plea in attacks at military sites

BYLINE: Josh White

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B05

LENGTH: 794 words

Yonathan Melaku was sneaking through Fort Myer and Arlington National Cemetery, his backpack filled with plastic bags of ammonium nitrate, a notebook containing jihadist messages and a can of black spray paint. The 23-year-old former Marine was heading to the graves of the nation's most recent heroes, aiming to desecrate the stones with Arabic statements and leave handfuls of explosive material nearby as a message.
Before police foiled the plan in June, the vandalism was to be Melaku's sixth attack, months after he went on a mysterious shooting spree that targeted the Pentagon, the National Museum of the Marine Corps and two other military buildings in Northern Virginia. A video found after Melaku's arrestshowed him wearing a black mask and shooting a 9mm handgun out of his Acura's passenger window as he drove along Interstate 95, shouting "God is great!" in Arabic. 
It was all part of a solitary campaign of "fear and terror," federal prosecutors said. But authorities and Melaku's defense attorney said no one knows for sure what led Melaku - a naturalized U.S. citizen from Ethiopia, local high school graduate and former Marine Corps reservist - down that path or what message he was trying to send.
Melaku stood in U.S. District Court in Alexandria on Thursday morning to plead guilty to three counts, including shooting at the Pentagon on Oct. 19, 2010, and attempting to  damage veterans' memorials on U.S. property. As part of a plea agreement, Melaku admitted to using his legally obtained 9mm handgun to shoot at the National Museum of the Marine Corps, the Pentagon and two military recruiting offices in October and November 2010.
The agreement calls for Melaku to serve 25 years in prison. Judge Gerald Bruce Lee accepted the plea, and Melaku is scheduled to be sentenced April 27.
Although Melaku acknowledged firing at the buildings - attacks that did not injure anyone but caused an estimated $111,000 in damage - it remains unclear why he did it. In a video entered into evidence and released by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, Melaku says he was targeting the museum as a military building, to "turn it off permanently."
FBI officials and prosecutors said Melaku was on a personal terror mission. They said he researched jihadism on the Internet and had references to terrorism in a notebook and on his computer. It also seemed like he was gathering materials to make an improvised explosive device, although there was no indication how he would have used it.
Melaku wanted "to create fear and terror, which is what terrorists do," said Dana Boente, first assistant U.S. attorney in Alexandria.
Special Agent Jacqueline Maguire, of the FBI's Washington Field Office, said it was fortunate authorities caught Melaku before anyone was injured. She said it appears Melaku acted alone.
"This case shows that violent homegrown extremism is present in our community, whether by one person or by many," Maguire said.
Melaku, of the Alexandria section of Fairfax County, did not make a statement during the hearing, answering the judge's questions in low tones with "Yes, sir" and "No, sir." Two family members sat in the back of the courtroom. They declined to comment afterward.
When asked what he wanted to plead to the three counts included in his agreement, Melaku leaned forward to a microphone and said: "Uh, guilty, sir."
Gregory English, Melaku's defense attorney, said after the hearing that Melaku's family is of the Coptic Christian faith and that they were stunned to learn of his involvement in the crimes and the references to Islamic jihad. English said the shootings were out of character for Melaku, and he wonders whether his client suffers from a psychological problem.
English said Melaku thought that by shooting at the buildings he did, late at night, no one would get hurt. English said the video was intended for YouTube.
"As bad as it is, this is someone who essentially broke windows," English said. "It's vandalism. He has no link to terrorism. . . . He had a message, but I don't understand what that message was supposed to be."
Melaku took the plea agreement to avoid a possible mandatory sentence of more than 85 years in the face of solid evidence, English said.
FBI agents tracked down Melaku's Acura and the 9mm handgun - both of which Melaku sold after the shootings - and found gunshot residue on the car and matched the bullets from the shootings to the gun.
Melaku was a 2006 graduate of Thomas Edison High School in the Franconia section, having moved to the United States from Ethiopia as a youth, English said. Marine Corps officials have said that he joined the reserves in September 2007, adding that he was never deployed overseas and was not scheduled to deploy.

U.S. security firms shift from Mideast to Mexico

BYLINE: Nick Miroff;William Booth

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A01

LENGTH: 1333 words

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY

MEXICO CITY - With the Iraq war over and the American presence waning in Afghanistan, U.S. security contractors are looking for new prospects in Mexico, wherespreading criminal violence has created a growing demand for battle-ready professionals. 
After years of lucrative work in the Middle East and Central Asia, where their presence has been occasionally marred by incidents of excessive force and misconduct, contractors and private security firms of varying sizes and specialties are being drawn into a conflict closer to home. But Mexico's restrictive gun laws mean that foreign contractors must enter the bloody drug war unarmed as they take jobs ranging from consulting and technical training for the Mexican military to guarding business executives from kidnapping gangs and extortionists. 
Virginia-based DynCorp International has job openings in Mexico for aviation instructors and mechanics. The New York consulting firm Kroll hires anti-kidnapping specialists to protect Mexican business executives.
The companies are beckoned by swelling pots of public and private contracting gold. In November, the Pentagon's counter-narco-terrorism program office solicited bids on more than $3 billion in contracts worldwide, with an unspecified amount destined for operations in Mexico. The State Department has pledged nearly $2 billion in drug war aid to Mexico since 2008, much of it available to U.S. companies that can provide equipment or services to the besieged Mexican state. 
Security spending by private companies in Mexico and the Mexican government has also surged. Since President Felipe Calderon deployed Mexico's military against the country's drug kingpins in December 2006, the number of armed private security firms in the country has doubled, Mexican federal police statistics show. But while there are 1,400 licensed firms in good standing, analysts say there may be an additional 10,000 operating without proper authorization. 
Still, despite Mexico's potential for highly remunerative work, experts caution that it will never equal the bonanza that U.S. companies found in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
For one, the money available in Mexico doesn't measure up to the cash that flowed through the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, where the U.S. government spent more than $200 billion on private contractors over the past decade. 

Gun law restrictions
Then there's the issue of Article 27 of Mexico's firearms code, necessary reading for anyone tempted to make a transition from Kabul or Baghdad to Mexico's urban badlands. It essentially bans foreigners from carrying guns in Mexico - a deal-breaker for many would-be soldiers of fortune, despite their growing interest in the country, said Michael Braun, former DEA operations chief and now a partner with Spectre Group International LLC, a private security firm based in Alexandria. 
"The Mexican government is not going to allow U.S. contractors to be armed in Mexico, and I can tell you that alone will cause many companies large and small to not even consider performing work there," Braun said.
"The Mexican government and the Mexican people are extremely sensitive when it comes to these questions of sovereignty, and we need to respect that," he added.
Mexico maintains some of the tightestgun-control laws in the hemisphere, even as drug gangs amass formidable arsenals of AK-47 assault rifles, grenade launchers and other military-grade weapons. While foreigners who are permanent residents in Mexico can get permits to own certain firearms for hunting or home defense, Mexican law prohibits non-citizens from working as armed security guards or carrying concealed weapons for self-defense.
That has a broad, chilling effect on U.S. contractors contemplating work in Mexico, even among those who do not directly work in security details as bodyguards, analysts say. Many private security contractors are military veterans who are accustomed to keeping at least a handgun for self-defense, and they balk at the thought of going unarmed into one of Mexico's hot zones, such as Ciudad Juarez or Nuevo Laredo. 
"A lot of guys ask me: 'How do you carry down there?' And when I say I don't, they can't believe it," said Rick Sweeney, chief executive of California-based SECFOR, which provides personal security services to business executives in several of Mexico's manufacturing centers, mostly along the border.
Sweeney said he worked as a security contractor in Iraq until 2006. Today, all of his 15 or so contractors are deployed in Mexico. Most are ex-soldiers from Britain and Australia. None is allowed to carry a weapon, so they team with local Mexican companies that can provide firepower.
"Everyone thinks if they worked in Iraq and Afghanistan they can work in Mexico, but it's a different ballgame," Sweeney said. "I'm not looking for the guys who come to me and say they're an expert shot or a black belt. I'm looking for guys who can plan and stay out of trouble, rather than blast their way out of trouble once it starts."

Partners vital - and risky
Armed private security is a booming business in many parts of Latin America, and demand for personal protection services in Mexico is growing at least 20 percent a year, driven by foreign and local business executives looking to safeguard their families and employees, according to Robert Munks, a senior Americas analyst with London-based IHS-Jane's, which tracks global security trends. 
Foreign contractors who partner with Mexican firms to provide armed guards typically subject those workers to extensive background checks, according to Munks, but contractors are still exposed to considerable risk. 
"They have to be incredibly careful about who they partner with," he said. "A very large percentage of people working in private security are suspected of working with organized crime networks."
Still, the huge volume of trade between the United States and Mexico often necessitates that American executives cross the border. Companies that do not have much experience in Mexico are especially concerned about sending their staffers, even for short trips, according to Robert Oatman, a Maryland-based security consultant.
"You're not going to see many executives traveling to Tijuana, or if they do, they're not spending the night," Oatman said.

A boom in training
A growing number of former and current U.S. military personnel are also training Mexican security forces in counterinsurgency, electronic surveillance and other techniques honed by the long American engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
American security aid pays for some of those programs, while other contractors are paid by the Mexican government, whose spending on security jumped from $1.7 billion in 2005 to more than $12 billion in 2011, according to the think tank Mexico Evalua.
There are no precise figures on the number of U.S. security contractors working in Mexico, but the Pentagon and the State Department spent $635.8 million on counternarcotics contracts in Latin America in 2009, a 32 percent increase from 2005, according to an analysis prepared by the office of Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) in June. 
The report found that the United States awarded more than $170 million in counternarcotics contracts in Mexico between 2005 and 2009, much of that from the nearly $2 billion in security assistance that Congress has allocated through the Merida Initiative.
Still, analysts say the U.S. role in Mexico will always be limited by sensitivities to the bitter legacy of armed American troops south of the border.
"The U.S. government is afraid of overstepping, given the limited welcome it has in Mexico," said Nick Schwellenbach, an investigator at the Project on Government Oversight, a District-based watchdog group. "And given the history," he added.

rr ֲ½ The Adventures of Tintin
Tintin is the young red-haired journalist who has charmed generations of readers with his mystery-solving exploits since the Belgian cartoon artist Herge introduced him in 1929. Sadly, Herge isn't around to see Steven Spielberg's crisp, richly rendered animated adaptation, which could be counted as both a success and a failure. From the film's opening sequence every frame is jam-packed with gleaming surfaces and beguiling reflections, with Spielberg deploying 3-D motion-capture technology to create impressively lifelike movement on-screen. No sooner does Tintin barter successfully for a rare model ship than two men try to steal it, those mysterious encounters eventually sending Tintin and Snowy on an adventure that will take them from Europe to the high seas and eventually to North Africa. The story really gets rollicking when Tintin meets Captain Haddock, a dipsomaniacal seafarer. But even at its most visually ingenious, the film remains an oddly airless affair, with Tintin smoothly sailing through perils, often greeting them with a "Great snakes!" or other wholesome exclamation. On the surface, "The Adventures of Tintin" is unimpeachable, but the surface is where it stays. That's why, when all the chases, fights, stunts and standoffs are over, it's ultimately no great snakes. (PG, 107 minutes) Contains adventure action violence, some drunkenness, brief smoking. Area theaters.

rr ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS: Chipwrecked
Either you're eagerly anticipating "Chipwrecked," the third installment in the lucrative "Alvin and the Chipmunks" series, or you've opted to avoid these films like the plague. As usual, Alvin (voiced by Justin Long) remains the chipmunks' chief instigator while the three embark on an ocean-spanning trip with their beleaguered agent/parent, Dave (Jason Lee). The mischievous critter's latest prank gets his fuzzy mates - and their adorable female counterparts, the Chipettes - tied up in a parasail that carries them off the starboard side of a cruise ship and onto a tropical island. We're introduced to Zoe (Jenny Slate), a FedEx pilot who tells the chipmunks she has been stranded on the island for eight or nine years. Just don't ask why her clothes are clean, her hair is perfect and she hasn't run out of eye makeup. And sensible chipmunk Simon (Matthew Gray Gubler) reveals a swashbuckling split personality after an indigenous spider injects him with neurotoxins. The "Chipmunks" have a very loyal audience and "Chipwrecked" serves up more of the derivative chaos that floats this franchise's boat. (G, 87 minutes) Contains nothing objectionable. Area theaters.

rrrr The Artist
A delectable homage to the silent movies of the 1920s, Michel Hazanavicius's romantic comedy plays like a sweet, airy confection. The fact that "The Artist" is itself a silent movie - in black-and-white, no less - shouldn't deter viewers from giving it a whirl. "The Artist" opens in 1927, when the dapper film star George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) rules Hollywoodland. When George crosses paths with an eager newcomer named Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo), he's cast in the role of mentor; but when talking pictures become the order of the day, she quickly begins an ascent up stardom's ladder, while George's fortunes begin their inevitable slide. Even the most arresting visual stunts would amount to little more than pastiche were it not for Dujardin and Bejo, who infuse their characters with palpable longing and regret. With equally able supporting performances, "The Artist" hews faithfully to the classics it so dazzlingly celebrates, offering a cautionary parable regarding the wages of fame but wrapping it in velvety aesthetic values, crisp storytelling and fabulous dance numbers. (PG-13, 100 minutes) Contains a disturbing image and a crude gesture. Area theaters.

(NR) Beauty and the Beast 3D
Back when The Washington Post had different reviewers see the same movie, our critics had two views of Disney's 1991 production of "Beauty and the Beast," which is now in theaters in 3-D. Desson Howe said: "'Beast' isn't one of the all-time greats. In fact, it feels like 'The Little Mermaid' with fur. Of course, such formulaic maneuvering will be lost on most youngsters. There are enough Disney injections in 'Beast' to ensure a pleasant enough experience for them." But critic Hal Hinson was charmed: "Disney's new full-length animated feature, 'Beauty and the Beast,' is more than a return to classic form, it's a delightfully satisfying modern fable, a near-masterpiece that draws on the sublime traditions of the past while remaining completely in sync with the sensibility of its time." Well, it's up to another generation of viewers to decide what they think of this "tale as old as time." (G, 84 minutes) Contains nothing objectionable. Area theaters.

rr ֲ½ born to be wild 3d
The 40-minute film tells the parallel stories of primatologist Birute Galdikas, who rescues orphaned orangutans in Borneo, and Daphne Sheldrick, savior of Kenya's motherless elephant calves. While there's an important story here - how these two women take in endangered animals with the intention of later releasing them back into the wild - the main attraction is the general adorableness. The primates wrap their spindly arms around their caretakers for a loose hug; a playful elephant pokes its trunk into its sleeping keeper's belly as a wake-up call; the pachyderms trot in single file down a dirt path the way kids in preschool might. While so many movies offer a seemingly pointless 3-D element, "Born to Be Wild" has some spectacular moments. Thanks to an economical run time and a touching story line, "Born to Be Wild" feels like a ready-made afternoon of family fun. It's almost like a trip to the zoo, except the animals seem happier - and smell like popcorn. (G, 40 minutes) Contains almost unbearable cuteness. At Samuel C. Johnson Imax Theater.
- Stephanie Merry

r  ֲ½ Carnage
The movie adaptation of Yasmina Reza's Tony-winning comedy of manners, "God of Carnage," purports to be a satirical skewering of modern-day parenting, its hypocrisies, power plays and smug moralizing. But in this leaden production - directed in a rare flat-footed outing by Roman Polanski - what are supposed to be transgressive observations about the holy state of parenthood and matrimony instead come across as self-satisfied and shallow. As the film opens, two couples finish up a meeting regarding their sons, who fought earlier in the day. Whereas Christoph Waltz and Kate Winslet easily find their footing as one of those couples - Alan and Nancy Cowan, the prosperous parents of the aggressor in the playground encounter - Jodie Foster and John C. Reilly seem perpetually off balance and ill-matched as Penelope and Michael Longstreet, an activist author and household supplies wholesaler, respectively, whose son took a wallop to the mouth. Watching Foster and Reilly is like watching an entire other movie, with Foster especially at sea when it comes to Penelope, a caricature of liberal self-deception. Not only does she seem not to be married to Michael, they don't even seem to have met, an impression that only heightens as "Carnage" escalates to its titular resolution. By that time, filmgoers are presumably supposed to be laughing uproariously at the posturings and poses of Modern Yuppie Families. Instead they're likely to be yawning at observations that seem mirthlessly trite and timeworn. (R, 80 minutes) Contains profanity. At Landmark's Bethesda Row Cinema.

rr ֲ½ Contraband
Directed by actor-director Baltasar Kormakur, the film has a gloomy, propulsive, working-class energy that feels slightly more European than Hollywood-y. When we first meet Chris Farraday (Mark Wahlberg), he has left the smuggling game to raise a family and build a legitimate business in suburban New Orleans. But when his wife's younger brother, Andy, winds up in hock to a volatile drug dealer (Giovanni Ribisi), Chris is forced to take up his old ways to pay off the debt and to keep Andy from being shot in the head. Playing against type, Ribisi makes for a compelling, and frighteningly unhinged, villain. Briggs also threatens Chris's wife and his two young sons, unless Chris comes up with the money. A quick plan is thrown together to hop down to Panama on the next freighter and come back with a pile of counterfeit currency. But the plan spins rapidly, and bloodily, out of control. The plot also leaves a lot of dead bodies in its wake. That said, "Contraband" delivers certain rewards, both expected and unexpected. (R, 109 minutes) Contains violence, frequent obscenity, drug use and other lawbreaking. Area theaters.
- Michael O'Sullivan

rrr A Dangerous Method
When the movie opens in 1904, a young woman named Sabina Spielrein (Keira Knightley) arrives at a psychiatric hospital in Zurich, contorted in paroxysms of full-blown hysterics. She comes under the care of a young psychiatrist named Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender), who follows the experimental techniques of a neurologist named Sigmund Freud. He begins to correspond with Freud (Viggo Mortensen), who, when they finally meet, leads his visitor on a conversation that will last 13 hours. "A Dangerous Method" captures Jung and Freud's budding mutual comprehension with the giddy sweep of a young romance. It may be Jung and Spielrein whose relationship becomes more erotically complicated, but the core of David Cronenberg's film is the intellectual love story between two men whose six-year collaboration would shake and shape modern thought. (R, 99 minutes) Contains sexual content and brief profanity. Area theaters.
- A.H.

rrrr THE DESCENDANTS
The Descendants" is an ode to emotional dissonance, wherein regret and antic humor can coexist and even share a drink; it's a tricky tonal high-wire act pulled off with uncommon skill and aplomb. Matt King (George Clooney) is the wealthy descendant of Hawaiian royalty, a privileged native of the islands who as the movie opens is watching his wife lie comatose in a hospital bed after suffering a near-fatal boating accident. A distant husband and father, Matt must find a way to bond with his daughters. While Matt struggles to be a genuine father after being "the understudy" for so many years, he's also navigating the sale of a pristine plot of land on Kauai that his family has owned for years. While Matt contemplates the meaning of his family's heritage, he also makes a series of hilariously flawed attempts to create a future as his wife hovers in a vegetative state. Eschewing his movie-star glamour without once shedding his compulsive watchability, Clooney moves through all those feelings in his best, most complex performance since "Michael Clayton." (R, 115 minutes) Contains profanity, including sexual references. Area theaters.

r The Devil Inside
The terror begins in Anytown, U.S.A., where Maria Rossi brutally killed two priests and a nun. Seems they were trying to evict a demon. Found not guilty by reason of insanity, Maria is sent to an asylum near the Tiber, perhaps because fresh pasta is good for schizophrenia. Twenty years later, Maria's now-grown daughter, Isabella, travels to Rome to visit her mom. Naturally, she's making a documentary about the trip, so she drags along a video guy. Isabella soon falls in with two young priests who are renegade exorcists. Naturally, the boys want to try their techniques on Maria. One problem, though: Sometimes a freshly exorcised fiend gloms onto an innocent bystander, turning him or her into a twisted, howling bag of hate. You can see where this is going, and the filmmakers can see that you can see. So they rush to the hideous yet hilarious climax in little more than an hour and then pad the running time with the slowest-moving credits ever. Even Satan, trapped for all eternity in his sulfurous kingdom, would probably get antsy watching them crawl. (R, 79 minutes) Contains violence, grisly images and profanity. At AMC Potomac Mills and Cinemark Egyptian.
- Mark Jenkins

r Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close
There's a fine line between precocious and insufferable, and it's a line continually crossed by Stephen Daldry's extremely labored and incredibly crass adaptation of Jonathan Safran Foer's novel. The story of how a young boy processes the trauma of his father's death on Sept. 11, 2001, the film brazenly mines the imagery of that day to create a morbid pastiche of iconographic symbols. Oskar Schell narrates the story of how he lost his father on what he calls The Worst Day and how a key he left behind somehow figures into an imaginary game they used to play. The film tracks Oskar on an odyssey through New York as he meets random people, tells them about his loss and thereby spins an invisible web of transcendence everywhere he roams. Rather than the rigor and restraint that's called for here, Daldry lays the sentiment and studied idiosyncracies on with a trowel like a pastry-maker who can't stop piling on the whipped cream. (PG-13, 129 minutes) Contains emotional thematic material, some disturbing images and profanity. Area theaters.
- A.H.

rr The Flowers of War
As the movie opens, Japanese soldiers have just overtaken the city, and schoolgirls attempting to return to their convent duck trigger-happy enemies. American mortician John Miller, who turns out to be an alcoholic cad, is also headed toward the cathedral to bury a recently deceased priest. The church is a designated safe zone, so a group of prostitutes from the nearby red-light district also seeks the cathedral's refuge. But when the motley crew ends up under the watchful eye of Japanese soldiers purporting to protect them, the group struggles to escape the city. All the arresting images in the world can't overcome the story, which seems to exist in a far-fetched reality where grown women giggle and joke while bombs explode nearby, a money-hungry pig transforms himself instantaneously into a selfless father figure and people leave a safe haven under implausible circumstances. In these cases, it's simpler to shake one's head in disbelief than hang it in sorrow. (R, 141 minutes) Contains brutal violence, rape and strong language. In Mandarin, Japanese and English with English subtitles. At AMC Loews Shirlington.

rr ֲ½ The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo
Handsomely filmed and impeccably acted, this film is at once satisfying and underwhelming, a pristine, coolly atmospheric procedural thriller that comes to the party a tad overdressed in inexplicably breathless hype. A wealthy industrialist named Henrik Vanger hires Stockholm journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) to research a decades-long mystery involving Vanger's niece and her disappearance. Blomkvist is joined by Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), the sullen, leather-clad computer hacker hired by Vanger to vet Blomkvist's record, then hired by Blomkvist to assist in the case. The movie's most unsettling scenes, a brutal rape and an equally torturous act of revenge, are staged for maximum shock value. Even at its most sordid, the film remains watchable largely thanks to Mara's in-for-a-pound embodiment of Lisbeth's explosive, righteous rage and covert vulnerability. The film may want it both ways, getting its tawdry kicks while tsk-tsking those who deliver them in real life, but Mara's bristling, unbridled performance gives the film the ballast it needs to pull off that curious, undeniably engrossing, balancing act. (R, 158 minutes) Contains brutal violent content, including rape and torture, strong sexuality, graphic nudity and profanity. Area theaters.
- A.H.

r  ֲ½ Happy Feet Two
In "Happy Feet Two," there's precious little of what gave the original "Happy Feet" its incongruous, yet infectious charm: a tap-dancing penguin. A misfit young Emperor penguin named Mumble returns for the sequel, only this time he's all grown up . . . and a lot less fun. In his place are a lot of other polar creatures vying for screen time, and our attention. The side stories only serve to distract from the main narrative, which has to do with Mumble's (Elijah Wood) attempt to save his colony when it becomes stranded from its food supply after a collision of massive icebergs. That plot takes a long, long time to even kick in. And when it finally does, it's a bit of a letdown. But the biggest letdown is the absence of dancing. So much for happy feet. (PG, 100 minutes) Contains some bathroom humor and mild peril. At University Mall Theatres.

rrr Haywire
Mallory Kane joins Lisbeth Salander and Margaret Thatcher as the latest tough-girl movie heroine by leaving a trail of carnage, sulphur and various male body parts in her wake. Played by real-life mixed martial arts champion Gina Carano, Mallory is a steely, smoky-voiced creation. It emerges that Mallory, a former Marine, has something to do with a Blackwater-esque private contractor and a black ops mission gone wonky. Carano's not a great actress, but she doesn't need to be in a movie that, as conceived by screenwriter Lem Dobbshttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CWSX?ie=UTF8&tag=washpost-movies-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B00003CWSX" title="www.amazon.com, doesn't get bogged down in psychology or humanizing back stories. Instead, "Haywire" simply gives audiences what they came to see: bruising fight sequences set up and executed with economy, skill and one or two genuine jaw-dropping jolts. With its un-glam visuals and weirdly tacky sound design, "Haywire" stays true to its low-rent B-movie principles, right down to the fast, strong and quietly competent heroine at its center. (R, 105 minutes) Contains some violence. Area theaters.

rrr Hugo
When Martin Scorsese announced that he would make his first 3-D movie several of his fans pronounced themselves flummoxed. But we didn't know that the movie would be "Hugo," an exuberant, if occasionally uneven, adaptation of Brian Selznick's movie-inspired illustrated novel. "Hugo" begins with bravura tracking shots through a cavernous train station in 1930s Paris. The camera is following a 12-year-old boy who lives secretly just below the station's ceiling. When he's not scrounging for food, he's gathering trinkets and tools to fix a lifelike metal automaton that represents his last link to a once-happy life. It's a somber affair, its self-seriousness only deepening when Hugo runs afoul of a grumpy toy seller and his goddaughter, Isabelle. While Hugo and Isabelle seek to solve a mystery having to do with the automaton, what should be a project inflected with mischief and spontaneity takes on all the excitement of a starchy lecture. But during "Hugo's" final 20 minutes or so the film truly comes to life. With the director so clearly in his element, "Hugo" ends as a triumph, bursting with the poetry, verve and irrepressible love befitting a match made in movie heaven. (PG, 125 minutes) Contains mild thematic material, some action/peril and smoking. Area theaters.

r  ֲ½ Immortals
Based very loosely on the primordial Greek hero, Theseus (Henry Cavill) is a small-town prole who cares only for his mother. Because of a rough childhood, he rejects the gods of Olympus as hokum. His nemesis, batty King Hyperion (Mickey Rourke), believes in the gods but loathes them. He seeks the bow of Epirus, the only weapon that can free the Olympians' old rivals, the Titans, from their cell deep inside Mount Tartarus. The movie pays less attention to theology, however, than decapitations, castrations, eviscerations and the occasional parboiling alive of people inside a giant metal bull. Director Tarsem Singh's visual instincts overwhelm his storytelling finesse. The movie's self-importance is inflated by the usual pseudo-Wagnerian score and occasional narration by John Hurt, playing Theseus's humble but secretly divine mentor. He, too, has the gift of foresight, and at the story's end, he delivers a chilling, if unsurprising, prophecy: In the heavens above, he foresees a sequel. (R, 110 minutes) Contains extreme violence and one sexual scene with nudity. At University Mall Theatres.

rr The Iron Lady
Meryl Streep disappears so uncannily into former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher that her performance overpowers the movie. Filmgoers who come to see Streep in action will see only that: an actress at the top of her game, delivering a bravura performance - not a thoughtful, provocative portrait of one of the most consequential figures of the 20th century. Framed as a sequence of flashbacks Thatcher reflects on in late retirement, the result may be a more vulnerable, sympathetic portrait than the title suggests, but it also forces the filmmakers to leave far more vital aspects of her life and career on the cutting room floor. We get a version of Thatcher's life that's one part Oprah and one part Wikipedia. As adamantly un-intellectual as "The Iron Lady" is, it's still undeniably entertaining. "The Iron Lady" is a curious piece of work, leaving viewers with the sense that its subject has been both lionized and punished, but in neither case fully or fairly understood. (PG-13, 105 minutes) Contains some violent images and brief nudity. Area theaters.

rr Joyful Noise
Times are tough for the citizens of Pacashau, Ga., and not just because the recession has shuttered most of the town's businesses. The director of the Divinity Church Choir has died, making the group's chances for top prize at the National Joyful Noise Competition look bleak. To make matters worse, the choir finds itself divided when Vi Rose Hill (Queen Latifah) is chosen over the choir director's widow, G.G. Sparrow (Dolly Parton), to helm the group. The movie revolves around keeping the faith through obstacle after obstacle, but the dramedy's ultimate feel-good nature proves infectious, even for those of us whose weekend routine doesn't include a trip to church. Despite some mawkish dialogue, there's something to be said for leaving the theater with a smile. (PG-13, 118 minutes.) Contains strong language, brief violence and sexual situations. Area theaters.

rrrr Le Havre
Welcome to the tender, deadpan world of Aki Kaurismaki, a Finnish filmmaker who has set his story of timely issues and timeless values in the French port city of the title. Arletty and her husband, Marcel, eke out a modest existence along with a tightknit community. When Marcel unexpectedly encounters a young man from Africa, what begins as one man's mission to make a small difference becomes a potent - and often hilarious - testament to the power of community and collective sense of duty. With its ragtag cast of cinematic archetypes, "Le Havre" is propelled by equal parts theology and whimsy. It's a treacherous combination that in Kaurismaki's capable hands results in one of the finest films of the year. (Unrated, 93 minutes) Contains nothing objectionable. In French with English subtitles. At West End Cinema.

rr ֲ½ Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol
Hand it to Tom Cruise: Even on the cusp of the creaky age of 50, he still manages to do his own stunts, look studly in a suit and maintain perfect hair sweepage. "Ghost Protocol" possesses the requisite number of expertly choreographed how'd-they-do-that scenes, as well as some terrific supporting performances from "Mission: Impossible" veterans and newcomers. Rather than strain so mightily to remind viewers of his still-rock-hard abs and blue-steel stare, Cruise is more than entitled to remind us that he can actually act. Especially when he convincingly plays Ethan convincingly playing a Russian general and then engages a Kremlin guard in some absurdly clever misdirection. That piece of visual legerdemain, as well as Ethan's quarry - Russian nuclear launch codes - are about as retro as it gets. By now the frenetic action, gargantuan scale and furious scurryings to save the world will have begun to take their toll - on the audience if not the protagonists, who have managed barely to break a sweat. There's a place in the movies for wish fulfillment, no doubt, including the wish for it all to be over. (PG-13, 133 minutes) Contains sequences of intense action and violence. Area theaters.

rrrr Moneyball
Filmmaker Bennett Miller barely puts a foot wrong in bringing to life the tale of Oakland A's general manager Billy Beane. In 2002 Beane (Brad Pitt) sought to rebuild the slumping A's and revolutionize baseball recruiting using "Sabermetrics." Miller has done a superb job of underplaying Pitt's native magnetism, which nonetheless peeks out enough to dazzle Yale-educated computer whiz Peter Brand (Jonah Hill, playing a character based on Paul DePodesta). Such logic runs afoul of Beane's old-school scouts. The secret of "Moneyball" isn't just that it makes viewers root for Beane and Brand, but for their motley crew of castoffs. Beane can relate: Not only was he a would-be star who didn't live up to his potential, but he now seeks to provide for his young daughter. It's difficult to review "Moneyball" without using the term "home run." So let's just say that it rounds all the bases with grace, modesty and a surfeit of heart. (PG-13, 133 minutes) Contains some strong profanity. At the Avalon and University Mall Theatres.

rrr ֲ½ The Muppets
"The Muppets" is both a delightful family film about the Muppets and a winking, self-referential satire about how lame the Muppets are. How does it manage that trick? By starting with the premise that the Muppets are has-beens. Kermit has disappeared from public view; Fozzie Bear is in a second-rate cover band; and Animal is in anger-management therapy. Just about the only one who has landed on her feet is Miss Piggy, who is now editor of French Vogue. What sets the plot in motion is a visit to Los Angeles by Gary, Mary and Walter (Gary's somewhat codependent brother). Walter is a Muppets groupie and when he arrives in Hollywood he can't quite accept the fact that his heroes are washed up. With the assistance of Gary and Mary, Walter sets out to reunite the Muppets for one last show, the proceeds from which will be used to save the decrepit Muppet Studios building from being torn down. So far so corny. What saves "The Muppets" from itself is a sharp eye for just how silly all of this is. Directed by James Bobin and co-written by Segel and Nicholas Stoller, the film is mordant without being mean and sweet without being saccharine. (PG, 98 minutes) Contains some flatulence-related humor. At AMC Courthouse Plaza and University Mall Theatres.

rr ֲ½ My Week With Marilyn
"My Week With Marilyn" is based on Colin Clark's memoirs, which recount his time as third assistant director on a routine cinematic farce directed by and starring Laurence Olivier. Marilyn Monroe was typecast as a simple hoofer, but off-camera she was rather complicated. Olivier comes from the theater and expects professionalism and discipline. Monroe (Michelle Williams) doesn't work when she isn't feeling it, and, after new husband Arthur Miller returns to New York, that's not very often. Enter Clark, who becomes Monroe's gofer, confidant and companion. Moody and dependent on pills, Monroe is not always fun, but Clark has a way with her, which vexes Olivier further. The relationship can't last, of course, yet Clark is sufficiently smitten to blow his chance with the pretty costume girl. If only "My Week With Marilyn" could turn it on so reliably, it might be profound rather simply pleasant. (R, 101 minutes) Contains profanity and sexual situations. At AFI Silver Theatre and West End Cinema.

rr ֲ½ Norwegian Wood
The adaptation of Haruki Murakami's 1987 novel follows Toru Watanabe, a college kid who moves to Tokyo in the late 1960s to escape the suffocating sadness of best friend Kizuki's inexplicable suicide. Kizuki's longtime girlfriend, Naoko, emerges from the ether, a lovely but lost figure haunted by the past. While the pair spend an increasing amount of time together two broken spirits seem only more damaged by proximity. Separately, both characters attempt to move beyond the past's long shadow. Watanabe embraces school, parties with friends and meets Midori, the sunny foil to Naoko's depressive specter. Oscar nominee Tran Anh Hung's adaptation excels at ambience with an otherworldly melancholy that saturates each scene. It's a story about thresholds, with kids on the brink of adulthood trying to experience life so close to death. At times, the story seems to exist in the instant between wakefulness and sleep, a dreamy state that's also startlingly realistic. (Unrated, 133 minutes) Contains sexual situations, explicit discussion of sex and suicide. In Japanese with English subtitles. At West End Cinema.

r  ֲ½ Oka!
It's a little strange, in a movie about an American ethnomusicologist's love affair with Pygmy music - a movie whose very name, "Oka!," means "listen" - that there's not a whole lot of music. There's some, just enough to show you why the main character - based on real-life ethnomusicologist Louis Sarno - is so obsessed with it. But most of the film is devoted to pretty visuals: shots of picturesque nature, and scenes of Pygmies hunting, dancing or just sitting around shooting the breeze. Sarno's stand-in, Larry Whitman, searches for a kind of Pygmy horn called a molimo, whose music he has heard of, but never actually heard. Subtle background tension is provided by subplots concerning deforestation, conflict between the Bayaka and their Bantu neighbors and attempts by an officious local mayor to modernize a people who don't necessarily want to be modernized. "Oka!" never picks up much steam with any of these plot devices. That said, "Oka!" is not without its folksy charms, even if most of them involve things that you look at, rather than listen to. (Unrated, 109 minutes) Contains nonsexual nudity and brief, mild obscenity. In English, French, Sango and Akka with English subtitles. At West End Cinema.

rrrr Pariah
This invigoratingly fresh, optimistic film plunges the audience into a world that's both tough and tender, vivid and grim, drenched in poetry and music and pain and discovery. Adepero Oduye plays Alike, a 17-year-old trying to navigate the usual social and family tensions, but Alike confronts an extra obstacle: She's gay, which places her outside the norms of the black community, many of her adolescent peers and mostly her own family. If Alike has trouble coming out at home, she's just as confounded by a gay community defined by aggressive girls and their girlier counterparts. Director Dee Rees captures the angst and brimming brio of Alike's journey with extraordinary sensitivity and observant wit, infusing an otherwise familiar coming-of-age tale with humor, style and an ear for dialogue and music that grounds the movie in street-wise verisimilitude. No community in "Pariah" is presented as monolithic, one of the great strengths of a film that celebrates self-definition as a mutable, fluid, continually dynamic process. (R, 86 minutes) Contains sexual content and profanity. At Landmark's E Street Cinema.
- A.H.

rrr Puss in Boots
The feature-length animated spinoff - a star turn for the popular "Shrek" supporting character voiced by Antonio Banderas - is almost shockingly good. The character is still something of a delusional Casanova, and the action is still set in the world of fairy tales, but the story has been given a spicy spaghetti-western kick. "Puss in Boots" centers on Puss's efforts to steal the goose that lays the golden eggs from a giant's castle in the clouds. Assisting him in this adventure are his childhood pal Humpty Dumpty and rival cat burglar Kitty Softpaws, who is, naturally, Puss's love interest. Their competition is a pair of outlaws, Jack and Jill, played by Billy Bob Thornton and Amy Sedaris. There's no stunt casting, just good, solid performances, even down to the bit parts. (PG, 90 minutes) Contains cartoon action, a death and a bit of earthy humor. At University Mall Theatres.
- M.O.

r  ֲ½ Red Tails
The complexions of its heroes aside, this George Lucas-produced dogfight epic could have been made during the same decade the Tuskegee Airmen helped beat Hitler. The war-movie cliches are as abundant as the antiaircraft fire, and the dialogue is as wooden as a balsa glider. The leading characters are issued one personality trait apiece, and some don't even get that. Cuba Gooding Jr., for example, plays Maj. Emanuelle Stance as a man who smokes a pipe. Soon the airmen have a big gig: escorting U.S. bombers as they lumber toward targets in Germany. The Red Tails quickly impress the bomber crews with their discipline. There will be casualties, of course. But this is the sort of old-fashioned melodrama where at least one man who's presumed dead will turn up in time for the final credits. And the bullets the Red Tails dodge in midair are balanced by the raves they receive on the ground: They're regularly toasted, symbolically or actually, by white pilots whose bigotry has been dispelled by seeing the airmen in action. The African American fliers' great achievement merits a great movie. "Red Tails" isn't it. (PG-13, 125 minutes) Contains war violence and alcohol use. Area theaters.
- M.J.

rrrr A Separation
Asghar Farhadi's domestic drama takes hold from its first moments and doesn't let go even long after the lights have come on. As "A Separation" opens, Nader and Simin address the camera as a judge is adjudicating their pending divorce. Simin is seeking a divorce from Nader, who has refused to move out of Iran with her and their 11-year-old daughter, Termeh. Nader wants to stay home to take care of his elderly father, who's suffering from Alzheimer's. When Simin's request for a divorce is refused and she leaves the house to stay with her parents, Nader hires a nurse named Razieh to look after his father. But Razieh is an observant, orthodox Muslim whose religious strictures and patriarchal tradition are at odds with the demands of her new job. As a seamless, seemingly effortless document, "A Separation" doesn't resemble a film much as a slice of life caught on the fly, with all of the spontaneity, surprise and contradiction that real life entails. (PG-13, 123 minutes) Contains mature thematic material. In Farsi with English subtitles. Area theaters.
- A.H.

rrr Shame
In Steve McQueen's mournful portrait of an addict hitting rock bottom, Michael Fassbender plays a man seeking self-annihilation through the compulsive pursuit of sex. Fassbender plays Brandon, a successful New Yorker who may be able to make it anywhere, but even when he's with another person he's alone. That changes with the sudden arrival of his little sister, Sissy, whose hospital bracelet indicates that all is not entirely well with her either. Sissy upsets Brandon's metronomically choreographed rituals, which, it becomes clear, emanate from a wound deep in their shared past. "Shame" leaves motivations and back stories up to the viewer's imagination and focuses with unblinking frankness on the depths of Brandon's most self-loathing behavior. Whether "Shame" is worth the gloomy descent into Manhattan's scurviest recesses depends on the viewer's tolerance for movies that offer no grand narrative or explicit meaning and instead simply provide a snapshot character study for audiences to ponder on their own. (NC-17, 99 minutes) Contains explicit sexual content. At Landmark's E Street Cinema.

rr ֲ½ Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows
Victoriana buffs will not be amused by this film, but it's a modest improvement on bad-boy director Guy Ritchie's first tweaking of Arthur Conan Doyle's iconic detective. Not because it's more subtle: This sequel is just as profligate as its 2009 predecessor, with explosions, anachronisms and quick cuts. But the dialogue is a little sharper, and Holmes gets a worthy opponent in Professor Moriarty. It seems a diabolical mastermind has begun a series of bombings and assassinations, hoping to spark a "world war." Robert Downey Jr. plays Holmes as brainy yet highly physical and keen on dressing up. Jude Law returns as Dr. Watson, Holmes's famous sidekick. "A Game of Shadows" draws here and there on Doyle's tales but relies more on Hong Kong's hyperactive 1980s new wave, as filtered through "The Matrix" and Quentin Tarantino. Extreme close-ups, violent edits and slo-mo inserts are used to depict both visceral action and Holmes's methodical thought. Thinking, however, is not the movie's priority. The game here is action-farce, and that's better played with swagger than intellect. (PG-13, 129 minutes) Contains action, violence and drug use. Area theaters.
- M.J.

rrr Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy
"Trust no one, Jim," the British spy chief known as Control says as the film opens. "Especially no one in the mainstream." With those tantalizing words of advice - delivered by John Hurt - the game is deliciously afoot in Tomas Alfredson's long-awaited adaptation of John le Carre's Cold War-era spy novel. Jim Prideaux and his boss, Control, are both working for the British intelligence service MI6 in 1973 as the film opens, when the Cold War is at its height and Control is certain that MI6 has been infiltrated by a mole. Control sends Jim to Hungary, where the events that transpire will have inevitable reverberations back in London, where veterans engage in silent-but-deadly bureaucratic knife fights, all the while being impassively observed by the masterfully reticent career spook George Smiley. After being 3-D'ed, CGI'ed and Imax'ed-out all year, "Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy" asks viewers to slow down their cinematic metabolisms, an adjustment that feels not just pleasant but positively lifesaving. As a stylistic and narrative throwback, Alfredson's adamantly un-thrilling procedural reminds viewers of an era when viewers allowed themselves to be entertained by a good yarn about a few colorful or at least colorlessly compelling characters. (R, 130 minutes) Contains violence, some sexuality, nudity and profanity. Area theaters.

r  ֲ½ The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1
Recent high school graduate Bella Swan grows up a lot, becoming a bride, a potential mother and perhaps something stranger. Yet the "Twilight Saga" hasn't matured along with its heroine. In the movie's bland first half, Bella (Kristen Stewart) prepares for woodland nuptials with pasty vampire dreamboat Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson). The couple's long-delayed consummation, supposedly both scary and wonderful, occurs off-camera and was enough to render Bella pregnant. Edward worried that his lovemaking would be too much for a mere human, but his shattering force pales next to the fetus's. Jacob Black's (Taylor Lautner) werewolf clan fears Bella and Edward's offspring and plans to terminate it. This is the series' swoon-inducing premise: to be desired by the two hottest boys in town, who compete to be best at protecting you. There'll be a lot more protecting in "Breaking Dawn - Part 2," scheduled for next November. (PG-13, 117 minutes) Contains disturbing images, violence, sexuality/partial nudity and some thematic elements. At University Mall Theatres.

NR Underworld: Awakening
Kate Beckinsale, her mop of gelled, jet-black hair dropped over one luminescent-blue eye, never makes us forget that she's doing this for the paycheck. Here the story is that she was nabbed in the middle of her last escape and thrown on ice. She awakens from cryogenic sleep to see that 12 years have passed and her werewolf/vampire "hybrid" lover Michael is gone - swept up in the purges humans carried out to rid the world of bloodsuckers. But there is a child that the surviving werewolves (Lycans) want to get their hands on, of which the few remaining covens of vampires are leery. The new villain is a scientist (Stephen Rea) who has been keeping Selene on ice and the child he calls "Subject 2" under wraps. And the new take on all this, by Swedish directors Bjorn Stein and Mans Marlind, is to show the bites, slashes and arterial spurts in extreme closeup. And in 3-D. It's a humorless movie of chases and epic brawls, of beasties, bites, blades and blood. No time for empathy or character development or clever dialogue. (R, 88 minutes)At area theaters. Contains sex, nudity, violence, gore and frightening scenes.

rrr War Horse
Man's inhumanity to man is examined through a boy's mystical connection to a horse in Steven Spielberg's stirring, expertly manipulative adaptation of Michael Morpurgo's 1982 novel. The plucky steed is named Joey, a playful thoroughbred colt admired from a distance by an English farm boy named Albert. When Albert's father, Ted, unexpectedly buys Joey, at first the boy is overjoyed. When Ted's landlord demands funds he's due, it looks as if the family will have to sell Joey - until Albert persuades him to plow an entire rocky field. When World War I dawns, Ted sells the horse, this time to the British forces, a stint that will send the doughty steed on a punishing odyssey through the war's bloodiest battlefields. With its bucolic vistas, soaring music, high-keyed lighting and magical plot convergences, "War Horse" would be too grandiose and simplistically fablelike to take were it not for Spielberg's masterfully constructed set pieces and the consistently steady human performances. More crucially, Joey proves to be a thoroughly charismatic protagonist. Spielberg has created an appropriate showcase for the magnificent creature that emerges, one that recalls the great movie horses of yore in a story guaranteed to pluck, grab and wring viewers' hearts, but thankfully not break them. (PG-13, 140 minutes) Contains intense sequences of wartime violence. Area theaters.
- A.H.

rrr We Bought a Zoo
Matt Damon plays Benjamin Mee, a widower who's been alone with his kids for six months when he decides to upend their lives and buy a broken-down zoo in Southern California. Based on the real-life Mee's actual memoir it contains all the ingredients of a maudlin, treacly weeper. Happily, writer-director Cameron Crowe keeps the most mawkish manipulations to a minimum in a movie that moves through its requisite stages - grief, acceptance, zany sights gags and healing - with smooth, entertaining efficiency. The title, by the way, is spoken twice by Mee's 7-year-old daughter, whose scene-stealing cuteness proves to be one of the most likable things in a movie that's all about being liked. The low-key appeal of "We Bought a Zoo" is nearly impossible to resist, not just because it provides the minimal daily requirement of hugs and closure, but because it's such an apt wish fulfillment fantasy when for many viewers Plan B isn't just a dream but a necessity. (PG, 126 minutes) Contains some profanity and some thematic elements. Area theaters.
- A.H.

rr ֲ½ Young Adult
Mavis Gary, played with perfect pitch by Charlize Theron, is a 37-year-old divorced writer facing the cancellation of her popular series of young adult novels. Lonely and depressed, Mavis shuffles around her apartment in sweat pants, swilling booze, eating fast food, watching bad TV and having meaningless sex. The actress wholeheartedly embraces Mavis's dark side with gusto. It's a performance that's as hard to look away from as it to watch, especially when Mavis decides to return to where she grew up in order to brazenly seduce the guy she dated in high school. Admittedly, there are some laughs here. Most come courtesy of Matt (Patton Oswalt), the overweight-geek former classmate of Mavis's who improbably reconnects with her upon her arrival. They make an odd couple. Mavis is physically perfect, but dangerously crazy. Matt's body may be mangled, but his brain and his heart are still working. No one in "Young Adult" is able to see how deranged Mavis has become, until it's almost too late. She's not cute-crazy either, but disturbingly damaged, pulling her hair out in clumps. Generally speaking, though, there's enough grit in the film's gears to keep the forward motion from ever getting too smooth. (R, 94 minutes) Contains obscenity and sexual dialogue. At AFI Silver Theatre and West End Cinema.

Gingrich's moon shot: New Space Age or science fiction?

BYLINE: Joel Achenbach

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A06

LENGTH: 1054 words

DATELINE: COCOA, FLA.

Cocoa, Fla. - The moon, a thin crescent, hovered in the western sky like a crystal bowl ready to catch a falling star. Cheers filled the air as Newt Gingrich's campaign bus eased out of the parking lot of the Holiday Inn Express. He had just made an astonishing vow: By the end of his second term as president, the U.S. flag would once again be planted on the moon. America, he said, would have a permanent lunar base.
Gingrich's speech Wednesday created big headlines Thursday on the Space Coast. People here have been eager to hear some launchin' words. 
The question is whether this is science fiction.
"I think it's an aggressive mission," said Robert Whelan, an aerospace executive with Harris Corp. That was his polite way of saying that building a lunar base by January 2021 - or even putting a single human bootprint on lunar soil - would be difficult to achieve.
Gingrich proposed doing this without increasing NASA's budget. Instead, he'd transform the agency's culture, rely heavily on private industry and leverage American ingenuity. He said he'd use 10 percent of the NASA budget - which would amount to nearly $2 billion a year - to create prizes, incentives for entrepreneurs to achieve spaceflight milestones.
Edward Ellegood, a space policy analyst at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, agreed with Whelan: "It's very, very aggressive." He said the prize-money strategy probably wouldn't work for such an ambitious mission. "Prizes at that scale don't work very well," he said.
Mitt Romney blasted Gingrich's moon base idea during the presidential debate Thursday night, saying, "That's an enormous expense," and suggesting Gingrich has been pandering to voters by making budget-busting promises at every campaign stop. He added, "It may be a big idea, but it's not a good idea." 
Rick Santorum echoed that sentiment: "To go out there and promise new programs and big ideas, it's a great thing to maybe get votes, but it's not a responsible thing." 
Gingrich stuck to his guns, saying his program would be "90 percent private sector" and he'd like to see space flight become so common that there would be "six or seven launches a day." He added: "I'd like to have an American on the moon before the Chinese get there." 
This has been a painful period for the Space Coast. People here launch spaceships - or at least they did until last summer, when the space shuttle was retired after 30 years of service. Unmanned rockets still blast off from the Air Force base at Cape Canaveral, but the end of the shuttle program has meant a dramatic reduction in highly specialized engineering and technical jobs.
President Obama killed NASA's Constellation program, created during the Bush years as a successor to the shuttle program. 
Instead, the administration placed a bet that commercial spacecraft will, in a few years, carry astronauts to the international space station.
Gingrich frequently attacks Obama in his stump speeches, but in the space talk he didn't mention him. Gingrich has been a vocal supporter of the president's efforts to privatize elements of the space program. The Gingrich strategy essentially takes the Obama approach and runs with it.
"You could call it the Obama-Gingrich model if you want. Gingrich is doubling down on Obama," said Charles Miller, a space industry consultant who until recently was a NASA official working on commercial spaceflight.
Obama has endorsed a manned mission to a near-Earth asteroid, with Mars remaining, as ever, the long-term objective of human spaceflight. But the president has not made space a major element of his political agenda.
Congress has insisted that the administration speed up efforts to build a new, heavy-lift rocket for deep-space exploration. That is still years away. In the meantime, no one's going anywhere, at least not in this part of the world. U.S. astronauts can get into orbit only when NASA purchases seats for them on a Russian spacecraft.
With NASA in this awkward transition, there's a market for a big-idea candidate who has a passion for space. But small-government advocates may see a Gingrich-style moon mission as another example of big-government overreach.
People in the audience Wednesday night liked what they heard. Gingrich threw in personal history (how he read Isaac Asimov novels and Missiles and Rockets magazine as a kid) and bluntly declared his disappointment with what's happened to the Space Age dream.
"I come at space from a standpoint of a romantic belief that it really is part of our destiny. And it has been tragic to see what has happened to our space program over the last 30 years," said Gingrich.
His vision of a moon base is distinctly American, even though space missions in recent decades have often involved international collaboration. Gingrich went so far as to bring up a proposal he made when he was a young congressman to create a "Northwest Ordinance" for space in which, as soon as 13,000 Americans lived on the moon, they could petition to become a state.
"Probably the best speech I've heard in this political season so far. Visionary," said John Weiler, 67, a retired shuttle worker.
"What they blame Obama for is not having a vision," said David McLaughlin, 53, a NASA technician.
About 700 people showed up for the speech, with many forced to wait outside, listening over loudspeakers. Gingrich provided a lesson in American progress and associated himself with some of the great names of American leadership and innovation. He spoke of Abraham Lincoln standing on the bank of the Missouri River in Council Bluffs, Iowa, in 1859, endorsing the construction of an intercontinental railroad. Lincoln, Gingrich said, had advocated railroad construction since long before he ever saw a train.
"I would just want you to note: Lincoln standing at Council Bluffs was grandiose. The Wright Brothers standing at Kitty Hawk were grandiose. John F. Kennedy was grandiose. I accept the charge that I am grandiose and that Americans are instinctively grandiose," he said.
As he closed his speech, he hinted that historians would note what was said here on January 25, 2012, at the Holiday Inn Express off I-95 in Cocoa, Fla.
Someday, he told his supporters, they'd be able to say that they'd been there "at the beginning of the second great launch of the adventure that John F. Kennedy started."

Saul Alinsky's playbook

BYLINE: Melinda Henneberger

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A02

LENGTH: 1102 words

Newt Gingrich is only the latest in a long line of conservatives who accused President Obama of being a "Saul Alinskyradical." And Alinsky, who died when the president was 11, would delight in all the free PR. But he also would be the first to say Obamadoes not much resemble that remark.
If Alinsky were alive today, he'd surely be camped in front of the White House, using every trick in his book, "Rules for Radicals,"to point out the many ways in which the president is not an infiltrator of the dreaded establishment, but the personification of it. 
Oh, Alinsky and Obama do have a few things in common: They both lived in Chicago and were community organizers there, although that is a little like saying both Freud and my old roommate Lisa were psychotherapists.  
Both Alinsky and Obama are highly pragmatic, self-described change agents, too. And as I have pointed out before, if you think Obama was initially hailed as "The One," check out the 1940 editorial in the New York Herald Tribune that said if Alinsky's work bringing people together to improve their neighborhood in Chicago's notorious Back of the Yards meatpacking district could be replicated across the country, "it may well mean the salvation of our way of life."
But Obama is as cool as Alinsky was hot, as conservative in his tactics as Alinsky was outrageous.
And again in Tuesday night's State of the Union address, Obama followed none of Alinsky's rules for radicals.
That 1971 book, written shortly before Alinsky's death, begins, "What follows is for those who want to change the world from what it is to what they believe it should be. 'The Prince' was written by Machiavelli for the Haves on how to hold power. 'Rules for Radicals' is written for the Have-Nots on how to take it away."
The president has indeed drawn attention to the Have-Nots. And Michelle Obama, in her remarks at the Democratic National Convention in 2008, did refer to Alinsky when she said her husband had won her heart by speaking of turning the world as it is into the world as it should be.
Yet Alinsky's blueprint for revolution is the opposite of Obama's ultra-traditional path to power - via Harvard and elected office.
In his last and most lasting work, Alinsky wrote, "A Marxist begins with his prime truth that all evils are caused by the exploitation of the proletariat by the capitalists." Which pretty much rules out propping up capitalism's failures.
Alinksy's Rule No. 1: Power is not only what you have, but what the enemy thinks you have. Obama sometimes opens negotiations with such generous concessions that it's hard to imagine what's left in his pocket. After the debt-ceiling negotiations, there was a serious argumentover whether he'd been outsmarted or had secretly wanted the Republicans to carry the deficit-cutting day. Either way, a cunning and committed Marxist poker player he's not. And in his State of the Union address, he made no attempt to intimidate and many to cajole.
2. Never go outside the expertise of your people. Given the problems facing the global economy on the day he was sworn in, that was never even an option. Obama recruited many Republicans to serve in his administration.
3. Whenever possible, go outside the expertise of the enemy. Look for ways to increase insecurity, anxiety and uncertainty. If Obama thinks of his political adversaries as "the enemy," he's done a better job of masking it than they have where he's concerned.
Republicans argue that stoking "class warfare" is exactly what Obama did in Tuesday night's State of the Union, saying, "We can either settle for a country where a shrinking number of people do really well, while a growing number of Americans barely get by. Or we can restore an economy where everyone gets a fair shot, everyone does their fair share and everyone plays by the same set of rules." But he repeatedly spoke of the future as bright and getting brighter. And as an incumbent, it's insecurity, anxiety and uncertainty that are his enemies.
It would be hard, however, to see the Republican response to the speech, from Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, as anything but anxiety-producing: "On these evenings," Daniel said, "presidents naturally seek to find the sunny side of our national condition. But when President Obama claims that the state of our union is anything but grave, he must know in his heart that this is not true." Daniels also suggested that Democrats are "mortal enemies of Social Security and Medicare," and posited that we "are only a short distance behind Greece, Spain and other European countries now facing economic catastrophe." 
4. Make the enemy live up to its own book of rules. Obama has never made an issue of the occasionally imperfect match between the "family values" rhetoric and record of some of his rivals. (Although if Newt Gingrich is the nominee, Obama's super PAC will.) Tuesday night, instead of calling out Republicans in Congress, Obama said we should all learn from the Navy SEAL team that took out Osama bin Laden, and not even think about who's a Democrat and who's a Republican.
5. Ridicule is man's most potent weapon. Obama has shown unfortunate flashes of sarcasm, as when he said he told his 2008 primary opponent, "You're likable enough, Hillary." He's come off as dismissive, referring to "bitter" Midwesterners clinging to "guns or religion." And he's been too glib, as he acknowledged after telling Rick Warren that knowing when life begins was "above my paygrade." But ridicule? That's more in line with Gingrich calling Obama "the most effective food-stamp president in history." Or the president's golfing buddy, Republican Speaker John Boehner, calling the State of the Union "pathetic" before even seeing it.
Worst of all, though, according to Alinsky's blueprint, would be Obama's failure to adhere to his final rule:
13. Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it and polarize it. One acts decisively only in the conviction that all the angels are on one side and all the devils on the other.
Obama not only doesn't believe that, but he ran against it. He said again last night that "this nation is great because we get each other's backs."
GOP presidential contender Mitt Romney recently spoke of how those (Obama and also Gingrich) who adopt the tools of the left - the rhetorical pitchforks of the Have-Nots - might live to see those tools turned against themselves. But so far, that's not how it's worked at all. So far, the Alinsky playbook has been used to excellent effect - against Barack Obama.

Umbrella-wielding robber swiped more than pennies from heaven

The rain falls, according to the Bible, "on the just and on the unjust, " and a man who robbed a bank in Montgomery County on Friday may have taken that idea into account. 
The M&T Bank in Potomac was held up about 9:40 a.m. by a robber who seemed specially prepared for the wet weather conditions in the area at that time.
He had a handgun, Montgomery County police said. But he also carried, according to the description released by the police, an item not normally included in descriptions of robbers. During the robbery, police said in a statement, he "carried an umbrella."
Many people in many walks of life carry umbrellas, particularly on a day such as Friday, which was distinguished by dark clouds, a thunderstorm and heavy rain. More than half an inch was measured at Reagan National Airport.
But over the years, few descriptions of robbers have included umbrellas. Many wear hats, as did the man who carried out Friday's holdup, according to police. Some have taken to donning hooded garments, such as a sweatshirt, which police said was worn by the robber. He also wore a water-resistant jacket and pants, according to the description.
Police said the man entered the bank in the 10100 block of River Road, approached a teller, showed a small  gun and demanded cash. He obtained an undisclosed amount and went out the front door toward River Road.
The account did not say whether anyone saw the umbrella unfurled.

Robberies shatter tranquillity in NW

LENGTH: 905 words

Facing two men armed with a silver handgun, the Shepherd Park man handed over the keys to his Mercedes-Benz on Jan. 5. Five days later, a 65-year-old woman watched as a gunman raced across her lawn, demanded her purse and car keys, and stole her Lexus.
The robberies have continued in Shepherd Park, a quiet and diverse enclave of single-family homes near the city's northern tip. Armed robbers rifled through a 35-year-old man's pockets and took his car keys last week, a liquor store was robbed Saturday evening, and residents have reported a rash of thefts from cars. 
Concerns have bubbled over. On Monday night, more than 200 residents packed the Shepherd Elementary School gym - some sitting on the floor - to share stories of frustration and fear during a meeting attended by police and community leaders.
"I was robbed at gunpoint under the light of my porch. [Now] I run into my house and run to my car," said the 65-year-old woman, who asked that her name not be used because she was concerned for her safety. "I once felt comfortable. I felt safe. I no longer have that feeling."
City officials say there's an increase in robberies across the District. In Police Service Area 401, there were eight armed robberies in the first three weeks of the year - four in Shepherd Park - compared with none the year before, according to department statistics. PSA 401, one of the largest in the 4th District, covers the northern tip of the city, east of Rock Creek Park.
The robbers "have shattered the sense of peace in the neighborhood," D.C. Council member Muriel Bowser (D-Ward 4), who called the meeting, said in an interview.
D.C. Police Chief Cathy L. Lanier, who attended Monday's meeting, acknowledged a spike in robberies and said police don't have a clear understanding of what's behind it.
Police began deploying more uniformed patrols and plainclothes officers in the neighborhood in January, Lanier said. The city also plans to deploy on-duty firefighters in the area to add more eyes and act as deterrents, according to Paul Quander, deputy mayor for public safety.
"Robberies don't happen when there are witnesses around who will testify in court," Quander said.
Police are investigating repeat offenders and the newly released from jail, Lanier said. They are also considering using crime cameras - typically set up in high-crime areas to quickly gather data after an incident - and other technological tools in the neighborhood. Lanier declined to elaborate.
D.C. police are also stepping up coordination with officials in nearby Montgomery County to combat what they consider a shared problem. Fourth District Cmdr. Kimberly Chisley-Missouri said at Monday's meeting that city police are cooperating with their Maryland counterparts.
"We're constantly communicating," Chisley-Missouri said. "We still have work to do, but we will not stop until we identify who the suspects are."
Police were able to quickly recover two vehicles stolen in Shepherd Park. And on Jan 11., according to police spokeswoman Gwen Crump, an 18-year-old man was charged in connection with a robbery on Fifth Street NW, just south of Shepherd Park, earlier that day. Police are investigating whether that suspect might be involved in other area crimes.
Some residents remain concerned. Lifelong Shepherd Park resident Charles Branche Jr. said Monday that his two young sons were robbed at gunpoint across the border in December. In an interview, Branche said that crime has always ebbed and flowed in the area but that this spree carries a different level of urgency.
"This is about people being rolled up on with guns," Branche said.
Robberies appear to be on the rise citywide. In the first three weeks of 2012, according to department statistics, they are up nearly 70 percent from last year's numbers; armed robberies have more than doubled.
Lanier has been called to meetings with other neighborhood groups, among them residents of Upper Northwest contending with a string of street robberies. On Tuesday, at another appearance, she said police arrested more than 100 robbery suspects in the first three weeks of the year and plan to launch a program meant to encourage tips in robbery investigations with rewards of up to $10,000.
At Monday's meeting in Shepherd Park, discussions turned at times to police staffing levels. Lanier told residents that the department has more than 100 fewer officers than it did at this time last year because of attrition and budget pressures that prevented hiring.
In the 4th District, she said, there are more officers in part because of last year's realignment of police service boundaries. Bowser said she has noted increased police patrols in recent days and hopes to see them continue - but added that the city must ensure that the department is sufficiently staffed and funded.
"Long term, there can't be a time we don't provide these officers we need," Bowser said.
Quander promised that the city would support the police department. "There's a sense of danger," he said. "I get it. The mayor gets it."
Tim Shuy, who owns a Ledo's Pizza on Georgia Avenue and is president of the Shepherd Park Citizens Association, said in an interview that he has been pleased with the recently increased police presence but is worried that if crime recedes, so will police deployments.
"When the next fire comes somewhere else, is that where all the resources will go? Presence stops a lot of crime," Shuy said.

Mistrial is declared in detective's case 
A Prince George's County Circuit Court judge declared a mistrial Friday in the case of a police narcotics detective accused of stealing and selling guns that he had seized from criminals, authorities said. 
The mistrial was declared after jurors were unable to reach a unanimous verdict, said Nancy Lineman, a spokeswoman for the county state's attorney's office. She said prosecutors were weighing whether to retry the detective, Juan Carter.
Prosecutors had accused Carter of stealing and selling guns seized from criminals while he was assigned to a task force focused on gun crimes. Carter's attorneys denied the allegations, saying he was responsible only for paperwork errors.

VIRGINIA

HOT lanes project may cause 495 delays
The Virginia Department of Transportation plans to close the Capital Beltway inner loop exit to westbound Route 7 from 6:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday to install a bridge deck. This is part of the high-occupancy toll lanes project, also referred to as the 495 Express Lanes.
Saturday's work is likely to cause delays for Beltway traffic heading through Tysons Corner. Drivers who would normally use that exit will be directed to continue on the Beltway to Exit 46A for southbound Chain Bridge Road, then follow signs to the outer loop and to Exit 47A for westbound Route 7 West. 
But drivers trying to reach Tysons Corner Center could just stay on southbound Chain Bridge Road to enter the shopping mall.

In Libya, jobs for rebel fighters a distant goal

BYLINE: Alice Fordham

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A08

LENGTH: 1067 words

DATELINE: IN TRIPOLI, LIBYA

Despite repeated pledges by Libya's transitional government to find jobs for the rebel fighters who forced Moammar Gaddafi from power, tens of thousands of them are still operating in armed militia groups, patrolling streets and guarding buildings in Tripoli and other cities.
The fighters' presence adds to an atmosphere of insecurity, officials and ordinary Libyans say, as efforts to incorporate more than 50,000 fighters into Defense and Interior Ministry forces has lagged. Authorities say the presence of the irregular forces has made it difficult to distinguish between legitimate fighters and criminals, thousands of whom were freed by rebel forces and by Gaddafi during the months of fighting that eventually toppled the autocratic leader. 
Adding to the problem, many of the fighters say they will respect only an elected government and do not recognize the unelected transitional government.
With only the barest of police forces and only an embryonic army in place, fighting sometimes breaks out among the heavily armed men.
"There is no safety," said Amal, a teacher who declined to give her last name, who was shopping in the capital. "There are fights between one area and another," she added, describing how violence can quickly escalate when fighters occasionally turn to the heavy artillery they acquired during the war.

For the most part, orderly
After the liberation of the Libyan capital in August by a wave of NATO-backed revolutionary fighters, there was chaos, electricity and water shortages, and fighting in the streets. In some ways, life since then seems to have returned to normal, with shops and cafes open late, far fewer security checkpoints, and the rattle of celebratory gunfire largely silenced.
The unwelcome presence of fighters from outside the city has mostly ended, and heavy weapons are rarely visible in the streets. The revolutionary fighters who remain are, for the most part, organized and orderly, patrolling alongside a rudimentary police force or guarding banks, hotels and government buildings, despite rarely being paid. Different militias control different areas of the city, but the fighters say they coordinate with one another and with authorities to provide security.
Although overall violence has lessened, there were clashes in central Tripoli between local brigades and fighters from the city of Misurata on Jan. 3. Several people reportedly died. Fighting also flared up south of the capital Jan. 13, when one tribal militia charged another with harboring Gaddafi loyalists.
This week, there has been fighting in the former Gaddafi stronghold of Bani Walid between residents and rebel militias, Ian Martin, the head of the U.N. mission in the country,told a meeting of the Security Council on Wednesday.
"Although authorities have successfully contained these and other more minor incidents that continue to take place across the country on a regular basis, there is the ever-present possibility that similar outbreaks of violence could escalate and widen in scope," Martin said.

A slow process
Libya's transitional government, which was appointed in November and is preparing for summer elections, has repeatedly stressed that its first priority is to incorporate fighters into the police and army.
The process is not easy or fast. Youssef Mangoush, head of the armed forces, began work early this month. He said he is confident that he will include 25,000 rebels in the army that is being built but acknowledged that he will face many challenges assembling a force out of the chaotic remnants of Gaddafi's security structure.
"You can't compare this to Tunisia or Egypt," he said, where largely peaceful uprisings toppled presidents Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali and Hosni Mubarak early last year. "In those places, there were government institutions; you just changed the people. But in Libya, we didn't have institutions at all."
At the Interior Ministry, where the government has said that 25,000 fighters will be incorporated into a police force, only 500 have received jobs and training so far, said Faraj Senussi Arabi, a revolutionary fighter and commander of rebels who wants to work with the ministry. Some police are on the streets, he said, and fighters accompany them on patrols.
But many who fought in the battle for Tripoli five months ago are frustrated by the delays.
"These are impulsive kids," said Osama Juwali, the defense minister. "They want everything to happen fast."
Tens of thousands of questionnaires were recently distributed to fighters across the country, he said, asking them whether they wanted to join the police or army, or travel overseas for vocational training.
After the forms are returned this month, they will be assessed and jobs will be assigned, he said. In the meantime, he does not have plans to encourage people to give up weapons, which proliferated wildly during the fighting.
Heavy weaponry should eventually be handed over to the army, Juwali said, but he has no problem with rifles and small arms remaining in fighters' hands. "When you have lots of weapons, everyone has one but doesn't use it," he said.

Calls for paid officers
To maintain security, the head of Tripoli's local council, Abdul Rezzaq Abuhajar, coordinates with the Tripoli Military Council, the group headed by rebel leader Abdulhakim Belhadj that controls most of the brigades of Tripolitan fighters.
Abuhajar said civilian officials "want to see police on the streets, not revolutionaries." He called on the Defense and Interior ministries to move faster to fulfill promises to create paid jobs in the police and army, adding that unpaid rebels sometimes turn to crime.
Muhammad al-Daeki, whose makeup and perfume emporium is nestled under the Italianate arches in Tripoli's battered but elegant downtown, said commerce has almost returned to its prewar levels. "The store is open until 9 or 10 at night," he said on a recent weekend as he enthusiastically sprayed scent on shoppers.
Although life in the city generally has improved since Gaddafi was ousted, he said, one problem remains.
"Some people are getting around with guns," he said. "I don't want revolutionaries in control of security. I want them all under the government."

France to accelerate Afghan withdrawal

BYLINE: Edward Cody;Karen DeYoung

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A01

LENGTH: 1258 words

DATELINE: PARIS

PARIS - France announced Friday that it will pull its combat forces out of Afghanistan one year ahead of the scheduled NATO withdrawal and said it would urge the rest of the alliance to do the same.
President Nicolas Sarkozy made the unexpected proposal in concert with Afghan President Hamid Karzai at a news conference here. "We have decided. . . to ask NATO to consider a total handing of NATO combat missions to the Afghan army over the course of 2013," Sarkozy said.
The move dramatized growing uncertainty, in Afghanistan as well as in NATO countries, over the future of the U.S.-led military campaign against the Taliban. It could also complicate the Obama administration's deliberations over the pace of withdrawing U.S. troops.
The 33,000 "surge" troops President Obama sent to Afghanistan in 2010 are due to be home by the end of summer. The military believes that the remaining 68,000 should stay until the end of the 2014 summer fighting season to maintain and expand what they say are gains against the Taliban. Reopening NATO discussions on an end date would probably strengthen the hand of administration officials who envision a faster, phased drawdown that would save money as well as U.S. lives. 
NATO first set the 2014 target 14 months ago and has scheduled a summit in Chicago in May to begin to flesh out withdrawal plans. That discussion is likely to be accelerated, with Sarkozy saying his government would propose the early drawdown at a meeting of alliance defense ministers next week in Brussels.
Sarkozy said he intended to explain his reasoning to Obama by telephone Saturday.
Obama administration officials reacted with skepticism to the broader proposal for advancing the overall NATO withdrawal date. Decisions within the Afghanistan coalition, a senior administration official said, "are taken by 50 countries, not one." The coalition includes the 28 NATO members and an additional 22 countries.
"Anyone can propose anything for consideration," said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid inflaming the issue.
The official said that while the administration "doesn't necessarily disagree" that the transition process could be speeded up, turnover of Afghanistan's 34 provinces is now planned to take place in five "tranches," with each taking up to 18 months to transfer. So far, only two tranches have been turned over to Afghan security control, with the most difficult still to come. Ending the process by the end of next year would require starting the handover of all remaining tranches this year.
State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said that France had consulted ahead of time on its unilateral withdrawal decision and that "it could be managed" on the ground in Afghanistan. France is the fifth-largest contributor to the Afghan coalition, with 3,600 troops. Most are based in Kapisa province northeast of Kabul and engaged in training operations.
Sarkozy was said by his aides to have been deeply affected when an Afghan soldier opened fire with his automatic rifle on a group of French soldiers on Jan. 20as they were finishing a jog around their base. Four were killed and about 15 wounded.
That incident came less than a month after two French Foreign Legionnaires were shot and killed by another Afghan soldier, one of a growing number of such shootings over the past two years in what has been described as a sign of tension between Afghan recruits and their foreign trainers.
Sarkozy threatened then to accelerate France's withdrawal and suspended all French training and other operations.
In Friday's news conference, he said that training would resume within 24 hours, but that French troops would begin handing over security control in Kapisa to the Afghans in March, several months earlier than expected. He said France would increase its plans for withdrawal this year from 600 to 1,000 troops, and would finish the process by the end of next year.
The broader NATO proposal, presented as a Sarkozy-Karzai agreement, was seen in Washington as a reflection of the unpopularity of the war in France, where Sarkozy is facing a reelection race this spring, and yet another example of Karzai's penchant for throwing a wrench in the works of smooth policy formation.
A statement issued by National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor described existing plans for transition to Afghan national security control by the end of 2014 as "Karzai's goal," to which NATO had agreed. NATO, working with Karzai, already has a rough idea of the timing of the gradual turnover. Half of Afghanistan is already under domestic security control.
Without mentioning the proposal to move the end date ahead by a year, Vietor cited Obama's announcement in June that "the next phase of the transition" would be shaped in Chicago.
"The bottom line is that if Karzai doesn't want us there, there's nothing to say," said a second administration official who also spoke on the condition of anonymity. "We're not going to try to stay over his objections. What happens, though, is that a statement like this is made and then immediately walked back."
In late November, Karzai balked at a tentative confidence-building agreement reached in U.S.-Taliban talks, causing the deal to be at least temporarily scrapped. In early December, he publicly rejected one of its terms - the establishment of a Taliban office in Qatar - only to later change his mind and approve of the Qatar venue.
Karzai aides complained at the time that he felt cut out of the U.S.-Taliban discussions, which began in late 2010. Since then, plans for the office have moved ahead, and administration officials have said it is intended as a venue for direct negotiations between the Afghan government and the insurgents.
This week, Marc Grossman, the administration's top diplomat handling the talks, visited Qatar, where Taliban representatives have already established a presence. He then traveled to Italy, where he met with Karzai. The Afghan leader was in Europe to sign a series of bilateral agreements with Italy, France and Britain outlining their long-term support for Afghanistan after combat troops have departed.
The United States has yet to reach such an agreement, despite more than a year of negotiations. Among other things, the United States has refused to bow to Karzai's demands that nighttime military raids be halted and that terrorist detention facilities be handed over to Afghan control.
Sarkozy, like Obama, is at the start of a difficult reelection campaign. His main opponent in a two-round vote to be held April 22 and May 6 is Francois Hollande of the Socialist Party, who reacted to the four recent troop deaths by saying that, if elected, he would bring home all French soldiers from Afghanistan by the end of this year.
Although the French role in Afghanistan has drawn little opposition in Parliament, even among Socialists and other opposition forces, public opinion has become increasingly hostile as French casualties rise. A survey published Thursday by the CSA polling firm said 84 percent of those queried want a total pullout this year.
Eighty-two French soldiers have been killed since France intervened alongside the United States in 2001, most since Sarkozy increased the number of troops and opened them to more combat operations after his election in 2007.

Lambert cooks up harmony with grit

BYLINE: Scott Galupo

SECTION: STYLE; Pg. C03

LENGTH: 399 words

Country singer Miranda Lambert is not going to be one of those well-behaved women who rarely makes history.
Before the curtain dropped at Baltimore's 1st Mariner Arena on Thursday night, Beyonce's "Run the World (Girls)" was pumping through the PA system alongside a video montage of famous fearless women. 
Lambert's rowdy opening salvo, "Fastest Girl In Town," was a perfect thematic threefer: cars, guns and booze. She sang into a shotgun-shaped microphone stand and played a pink Stratocaster. On the mid-tempo rocker "Heart Like Mine," she imagined wine as the slender basis for mutuality with Jesus. "I'm proud to be everything but a Southern belle," she later declared.
The redneck chanteuse: To some unknowable extent it's pure shtick, but it matters not. She does it so well.
In fact, the flattest moment of Thursday's 90-minute set came as Lambert abandoned her persona and tried to go high-concept on the slow-jamming "Fine Tune." With the video screens having faded to black-and-white, Lambert picked up an antique microphone and retired to a fainting couch like some weary Hollywood goddess.
She quickly shook off the misfire with a breezy cover of the Creedence Clearwater Revival classic "Up Around the Bend."
Lambert's voice is rather on the petite side; infectious though they are, songs like "Kerosene," with its slashing guitars and martial drumbeat, easily overwhelmed her.
It was no wonder, then, that Lambert made ample time for introspective ballads such as "More Like Her" and "Over You." The latter, originally written in honor of husband Blake Shelton's late brother but rededicated to his recently deceased father, was doubly layered with personal tragedy.
An unflaggingly energetic audience - limited though it was to the arena's first and floor levels - seemed especially drawn to "The House That Built Me," Lambert's nostalgic tale of character formation.
The hit single "Baggage Claim" found Lambert's sweet spot. Its taut, mildly funky groove gave her space to unleash her inner Beyonce, and its woman-scorned lyric was hungrily devoured. As if to underscore the point, Lambert fashioned Tom Petty's "You're a Free Girl Now" into her own anthem.
For an encore, Lambert assayed Aretha Franklin's "Do Right Woman, Do Right Man."
So don't let the tattoos and shotguns fool you: Lambert may act like a spitfire, but she's full of soul.

I've always lived in big cities, where police blotters tend to read like this: "Officers called to scene of machine-gun altercation between heroin-crazed pimp and eye-gouge gang; 600 dead."
Turns out that not everywhere is like that. The following actual police blotter items were taken from the 2011 reports of the 41-person police department of upscale Vienna, Va., a distant suburb of Washington. 
l  A concerned citizen    reported an apparently intoxicated individual stumbling in the park. Of  cr. Sheeran ג[#x2c6][#x161] located the suspect and had to physically detain him. During the search, some freshly prepared sushi was discovered inside the front of suspect's pants. It is unclear from where the sushi was taken.
l  A citizen brought a loaded handgun to Vienna Police Headquarters. The citizen wanted the gun to be made safe. Ofcr. Simon unloaded the handgun for the citizen.
l  Ofcr. Evans investigated a case regarding an all-you-can-eat steak promotion. The customer had been served his first steak, wanted more, was told it would take 30 minutes to cook. The customer felt this was a deceptive practice and a way to get him to eat off the buffet instead of continuing to eat steak.
The restaurant manager reduced the amount of the customer's check and banned him from the property. The still-hungry customer left without incident.
l  A citizen reported that after dining at a restaurant he was confronted by a subject. The subject pointed his finger at the complainant and told him to respect women. He then left.
l  Tenant reported that his landlord would not allow him to use a particular bathroom inside the home. The tenant's usual toilet was unavailable. There was also a third toilet in the basement, but the tenant refused to use that one as it is necessary to hold the handle down for it to properly flush.
l  A citizen reported that a mother and her adult daughter were arguing over the daughter's moral behavior. After counseling from Sgt. Farhan, the two agreed to separate and go to their respective bedrooms.
l  A citizen reported that she ordered some pizzas from Joe's Pizza. Upon the arrival of the pizza, the complainant noted that the order was wrong and also took over an hour to be delivered. When the complainant called the restaurant to complain, an employee reportedly told her that if she "didn't speak nicely, he would have to kill her." Ofcr. Lose investigated and determined that the employee had actually stated, "Speak nicely so I can help you."
l  A citizen reported that a resident was housing chickens on his property. Ofcr. Barker investigated and determined that the animals are actually ducks and they live with a rabbit in a pen. There was no violation of law.
l  A woman reported that she and her husband are getting divorced. As they both passed in the hallway, she reported that he bumped into her with his belly and told her to move out of his way.
l  Employee of "Bridal Closet reported that she was assisting a client that was trying to fit into a dress. When the dress did not fit correctly, the client became disorderly and verbally abusive toward the employee.
l  A citizen reported    that a squirrel was refusing to get off of the top of his truck tire. Ofcr. Sheeran was able to convince the squirrel to leave the area and he scampered off into a wooded area.

A span of Dreams- and fears

DATELINE: IN BALUARTE GORGE, MEXICO

High in the wicked folds of the western Sierra Madre, Mexican transportation officials have launched one of the most ambitious road-building projects in history - an experiment in social engineering as much as a structural one.
Across a landscape of yawning ravines and sheer-sided ridges so rugged that locals call it el Espinazo del Diablo - the Devil's Backbone - the Mexican government is laying down a $1.5 billion "superhighway" that promises to exorcise centuries of isolation and bring an economic boom to one of the country's poorest and most troubled regions.
When the 140-mile toll road opens as soon as late 2012, it will cut drive time between the interior city of Durango and the Pacific port at Mazatlan from seven hours to 21 / 2, conquering the Sierra's unholy topography with 62 tunnels and 135 bridges.
More important, Mexican officials say, by completing a modern transportation link between the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean, the highway will bring wholesome economic development and the rule of law to a place dominated by some of the country's biggest dope growers and drug gangsters. 
At the heart of the endeavor is the Baluarte Bicentennial Bridge, uniting the states of Durango and Sinaloa with a gravity-defying ribbon of concrete 1,321 feet above the Baluarte River. Completed this month, it is the highest bridge in the Western Hemisphere, the second-highest in the world and highest structure of its kind (cable-stayed bridge) on the planet.
So high is the Baluarte's road deck that the Eiffel Tower could fit beneath it, or two Washington Monuments stacked end to end. With its long white cables and graceful towers rising 587 feet at opposite ends of the precipice, it may be the most breathtaking structure built in Mexico since the pyramids went up at Teotihuacan circa A.D. 100.
"This is a symbol of the prosperity we want for Mexico, a symbol of the Mexico of the future," President Felipe Calderon declared at the dedication ceremony for the bridge.
That the Baluarte was built by Mexican engineers was a special point of pride, he said - proof that the country stands with the industrial giants of the world.
But there is ample reason to worry that Mexico's superlative road could also serve as a super-conduit for drug trafficking.
With Calderon nearing the end of his term-limited, six-year presidency, the highway project is also emblematic of the legacy he wants to leave: one of economic stability and infrastructure modernization, not the savage drug violence that has left 50,000 dead since he took office.
For the president and other officials here, it is taken as a matter of course that the superhighway will bring a reduction in crime and lawlessness, by giving young men an alternative to working for the cartels. Much of the marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine sold on U.S. streets come from the farms and labs of the western Sierra Madre, a place that has long defied the civilizing intentions of government social workers and of missionaries before them.
"Infrastructure means jobs, infrastructure means development, infrastructure means progress toward a more just and prosperous Mexico," Calderon said in his speech. "By opening up these opportunities, we shut down other activities we don't want."
But just as the highway will make Durango and other states in Mexico's northwest interior attractive to foreign companies looking to build manufacturing plants, it will drive up the area's strategic importance for the traffickers, who often smuggle their U.S.-bound cargo in legitimate commercial loads.
And it will link two places that are already roiling with cartel violence. Last year, there were 307 homicides in Mazatlan, making it Mexico's seventh-most-violent city per capita, while Durango was the fifth deadliest, with 474 slayings, according to recent tallies.
Since April, investigators in Durango have pulled 282 bodies from more than a dozen mass graves in and around the city, where the dominant Sinaloa cartel has been fighting off incursions by various rivals, including Mexico's ascendant criminal power, Los Zetas.
Now, local officials hope transportation engineers can accomplish what police and politicians have not, and bring security to the region with growth, not more guns.
"The best way to fight crime and eliminate poverty is to create jobs," said Francisco Gutierrez, the top economic development official for the state of Durango. "This is the most important project in all of Mexico right now."

Pros and cons
Gutierrez has been traveling the world in recent months to promote the new highway, and already the effort appears to be paying off. In November, Chinese firms signed deals on seven new investment projects in Durango totaling more than $220 million in mining, chemicals and auto-parts manufacturing.
U.S. car-parts maker Delphi is adding 3,700 jobs in Durango this year, Gutierrez said, and a Chilean mining and forestry firm is pouring in $150 million in new investment. A Spanish company wants to build one of the world's largest solar-energy farms in the state.
Durango's cost advantages appear to trump security concerns for many foreign investors. The average wage in the state is $13 a day, one of the lowest rates in Mexico, and when the superhighway is in place, the Pacific port at Mazatlan will be perfectly positioned for growing trade with Asia.
And yet, development experts say that there is no definitive research proving that better infrastructure reduces crime.
"All kinds of things travel on roads - both desirable and not so desirable," Jordan Schwartz, the World Bank's lead economist for Sustainable Development in Latin America and the Caribbean, said in an interview.
"To suggest that better infrastructure leads directly to the rule of law would be naive," he said. "On the other hand, it is easier to intimidate, co-opt or destabilize an isolated community than one that is employed and connected."
But others see a clear path to social progress with the new road. In Concordia, the county seat on the Sinaloa side of the bridge, teacher Beatriz Moran said she thought the new highway would help persuade young educators from urban areas to take jobs in rural mountain communities, knowing that they wouldn't be stuck there and could easily go home on weekends.
"Right now, the kids in those towns only go to school through sixth grade because there aren't enough teachers," Moran said.
Jose Eligio Medina, the county's top official, dreams of adventure tourists and hikers exploring the mountains of Sinaloa - a place that the U.S. government now urges American travelers to avoid. "This road is going to change everything for us," Medina said, already drawing up plans for a restaurant and overlook at the bridge.

'It didn't seem possible'
When the first surveyors and engineers reached the bridge site five years ago, it was a four-hour ride on horseback. "We stood at the edge of the canyon and looked across, and it didn't seem possible," said engineer Carlos Zamundio, inviting a reporter to walk the newly completed span and peer into the sucking abyss below. "It was like putting together a puzzle, one piece at a time."
Tradeco, the Mexican firm that built the bridge, had to put 15 miles of dirt roads into near-vertical canyons just to get equipment to the construction site, where 1,300 laborers were employed at the project's peak.
"We had to build an entire village down here," said Salvador Sanchez, supervising engineer on the project, speaking in his office at the bottom of the gorge.
Not a single worker died, he said.
In contrast, during a reporter's trip to the bridge site, there were two trucking accidents on the old highway, one fatal; and at several locations along the route, the large, lumbering vehicles had to stop completely at tight curves, backing up to allow other drivers to squeeze by.
Sanchez said the new highway will go through - rather than over - the Devil's Backbone, maintaining a consistent 5 percent grade, even on the Baluarte Bridge.
Made of high-grade, pre-stressed concrete, the bridge's four-lane roadway is held up by bundles of suspension-mounted steel cables. Each five-eighths-inch strand can support more than 80 tons, and when banded together in bundles of up to 46 cables, they can absorb huge earthquakes as well as massive loads, he said.
"You could park heavy trucks on it from one end to another and nothing would happen," Sanchez said. "It's ready for anything."

A new name on his cinematic dance card

BYLINE: Mark Jenkins

SECTION: STYLE; Pg. T07

LENGTH: 855 words

German director Wim Wenders has always been interested in collaboration. He's written scripts with such authors as Sam Shepard and Peter Handke, worked with musicians as diverse as U2 and the Buena Vista Social Cluband co-directed a film with one of his cinematic forbears, Michelangelo Antonioni. Yet his new 3-D dance documentary, "Pina," comes as a surprise - even to him.
"I wasn't really into dance," Wenders says. "Actually, not at all. I had to be dragged to it. I resisted as long as possible. My girlfriend at the time said, 'You have to see this.' I said, 'No, I definitely do not have to see this.'ג[#x20ac][#x160]" 
But he went to a retrospective of choreographer Pina Bausch's work, and "it did change my life. I never thought dance could possibly do that to me."
"I was never able to warm up to classical ballet," says the filmmaker by phone from New York. "And a lot of modern dance also escapes me. Pina opened this world to me. She invented a whole new art form called 'dance-theater,' and that is still what I'm mostly interested in.
"When I saw Pina's first pieces, my body understood it, and I loved it. It actually said something about us, who we are, where we come from and how we feel."
Wenders's epiphany occurred in Venice in 1985, and a year later the filmmaker and choreographer met in her home base, Wuppertal, a small industrial German city. They discussed making a film, but the planning went slowly. In 2009, as shooting was finally about to start, Bausch died of cancer that been diagnosed just five days earlier.
"The concept for the film we wanted to do together was of course obsolete," Wenders recalls. "As a result of Pina's sudden passing away, which was unimaginable for us, I pulled the plug. Only weeks later, because of the dancers, I realized that maybe there was a film to be made without Pina. For Pina."
The movie they developed includes some talking-heads footage, but it's mostly dance, filmed in the theater, the city - including its most famous feature, an 112-year-old monorail system - and the surrounding countryside. Bausch and her dancers had made one film, 1990's "The Complaint of the Empress," and it was shot outdoors. So when the director took the camera outside, "it was as if Pina had suggested it herself."
Moving into the street "was something the dancers and I discovered together," Wenders says. "That if we wanted to make a film without Pina, but about her work, we couldn't just do it on the stage. Because Pina's inspiration was out in the world. Her inspiration was the city where she lived, and the industrial landscape around it."
Bausch was closely tied to the region. She was born in Solingen, near Wuppertal, and became the director of the Wuppertal Opera Ballet in 1973. A few months later, she remade it as the Tanztheater, or Dance Theater.
"It was a scandal at the time," says Wenders. "The first pieces that Pina mounted in Wuppertal, they had to call the police. People were so upset. Booing and slamming doors and walking out. But a few years later Wuppertal started to love Pina. In the last 10 years, if she brought a new play, people stood in line for days to get in. It is really the city's only claim to fame in the 21st century."
Wenders suggests that "Pina could not have done this body of work in a big city. Not Berlin or Paris, London or New York. But Wuppertal completely left Pina alone. It's not a pretty town. It's like many cities from the industrial revolution that were big in the 19th century. Actually, Wuppertal is quite depressed now. But Pina always said, 'That is my town. This is where I belong. This is where my work has its roots.'ג[#x20ac][#x160]"
The first film the director made after encountering Bausch's work was one of his most acclaimed, "Wings of Desire." He calls it "by far the most choreographed film I ever did. I couldn't consciously point out that it was influenced, here and here and there, by Pina. But the film as a whole was inspired by all the little things I discovered in Pina."
Wenders has documented the work of many sorts of artists, from fellow filmmakers to the elderly Cuban musicians of "Buena Vista Social Club" and Japanese fashion designer Yoji Yamamoto in "Notebook on Cities and Clothes." He does such films, he says, because "the creative process is one of the last great adventures left. I'm interested in where other creative people get their inspiration, and how their minds work. How they use life, and common experiences, in order to create. Different arts, underneath, have a lot in common. But you have to find it."
The director's new path to such discoveries is 3-D, used with grace and unexpected subtlety in "Pina." Although some consider the format a gimmick, Wenders is "entirely hooked. I have to tell you that I not going back."
"There's nothing better than being able to do something for the first time," he says. "Because after a while, you think you know your craft. That's the biggest danger. You start doing things because you're good at it, and you know how to do it. For 'Pina,' I did not know how to do it all. And that was . . . fantastic."

Sunnis who aided U.S. in Iraq struggle to fit in

BYLINE: Dan Morse

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A10

LENGTH: 1088 words

DATELINE: IN BAGHDAD

Muhannad Mahmoud can't find a place in the new Iraq.
The American military, which hired him and more than 80,000 other Sunni fighters to take on al-Qaeda-affiliated insurgents, just left. But the insurgents certainly have not.
The Iraqi government, increasingly dominated by Shiite powers, is leery about hiring the fighters as security forces. And even if Mahmoud were able to land such a job, some of his fellow Sunnis are so distrustful of the new government that they would label him a traitor.
As a member of the Sons of Iraq, who were widely credited with helping the United States restore stability to the country several years ago, Mahmoud and his brethren say they have been pushed to the side - even as insurgents come after them daily.
"I am ready to fight them again," Mahmoud said recently, taking a break from his job repairing power lines that run from a neighborhood generator to homes and businesses. 
For years, the Iraqi government has struggled to carry out a U.S.-brokered plan to find military or police jobs for the Sunni fighters - some of them genuine heroes, some of them former insurgents themselves. How the government treats them over the coming months could present a chance for reconciliation - or threaten to widen the country's sectarian divide, especially if Sons of Iraq members strike out on their own, or, worse, defect to groups such as al-Qaeda in Iraq.
These days, even with the increased violence, the Sons of Iraq stand out, targeted by daily assassination attempts. Throughout Iraq, they are known more broadly by the term "Sahwa." In the past week, four Iraqis connected to Sahwa were assassinated on a single day.
Two died on Tuesday when simultaneous blasts erupted outside their homes outside Fallujah. Another, Hassan Abdulla al-Timimi, who had risen to the rank of captain in the Abu Ghraib police force, was gunned down by insurgents who stormed his house and also killed his wife and three children, said Col. Sabah al-Falahi, a police commander in the area. A fourth, Mullah Nadem Jabouri, was shot by assassins armed with silencer pistols, according to security officials.
Jabouri was once a member of al-Qaeda in Iraq, but he renounced the group in 2007 and persuaded many Sunnis to fight against the terrorist organization. For the past two years he had been living in Jordan, but he was visiting Iraq and speaking with Sahwa and Sunni leaders.
"They're the most targeted and vulnerable people in Iraq," said Sterling Jensen, who studies the movement at the Near East South Asia Center for Strategic Studies and served as an Arabic interpreter for U.S. commanders here during the war.
"We're wanted by all the terrorists," said Mustaf Shibib al-Jubouri, a Sons of Iraq leader who has survived four car bombings and estimates that a half-dozen members of the group are attacked daily around the country.
The Sons of Iraq are certainly well known in Adhamiyah, a sprawling Sunni area in northern Baghdad where Mahmoud spends his days repairing the generator power lines. Back in 2007, as al-Qaeda in Iraq took over the area, Mahmoud learned that U.S. commanders were rounding up fighters and paying about $300 a month. The effort, as it turned out, was a key element of the U.S. strategy to turn the tide of the war.
Mahmoud fought in major battles against insurgents and helped patrol Adhamiyah's streets. Reports of the Sons of Iraq spread to neighborhood residents who had fled - people such as Zeiad Farouq Naaoush, who sought safety in Egypt after being kidnapped and then released for a ransom.
"My family told me the Sahwa is in the streets, and it's better," said Naaoush, who returned in 2008.
By then, the Sons of Iraq ranks had swelled to 100,000, including a small contingent of Shiite fighters. The United States transferred full management of the force to the Iraqi government in 2009, with the understanding that 20 percent of the fighters would be given jobs in Iraq's police or military units and that the government would try to find the others civil service or private-sector jobs.
But the process has moved slowly. Sons of Iraq members say they are denied jobs because they are Sunni, even as the Iraqi government welcomes onetime Shiite insurgents into jobs. The government says that it is committed to hiring Sons of Iraq members but that education levels prevent some of them from getting security jobs.
"They are not being dealt with on this sectarian basis," said Ali Hadi al-Moussawi, a spokesman for Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.
Zuhair al-Chalabi, head of Iraq's National Reconciliation Committee, said security forces in Baghdad have hired 9,000 Sons of Iraq members. In other provinces, Chalabi said, he would like to see police forces hire 7,600.
Further clouding the Sons of Iraq's future are recent comments from Maliki's office. An aide to the prime minister for reconciliation affairs, Amir al-Khuzai, told the al-Sharqiya news channel that security forces no longer want to hire Sons of Iraq members. Khuzai couldn't be reached for comment.
Analysts say that as Maliki consolidates control, he is under pressure from Shiite allies to halt the hiring of Sons of Iraq members into police or military forces. "He won't do anything significant to help the Sons of Iraq," said Jensen, the former U.S. military interpreter who has spoken to many Sons of Iraq members. He and others worry that the Iraqi government is pushing the Sons away at the very time they are needed to fight what appears to be a resurgent al-Qaeda in Iraq.
As more of the Sahwa get picked off, those who remain and feel abandoned by the government may be more willing to stake their loyalties elsewhere. Last week, Sons of Iraq leader Ahmmad Abu Risha's attention was focused on rumors that Shiite-dominated Karbala province would try to annex part of Sunni-dominated Anbar province. "We, the Sahwa forces, are ready to fight against these schemes that stem from Iran," he said.
Mahmoud, the generator line electrician, said he has not given up on trying to get a police job, despite his difficulties thus far. Mahmoud said a police agency hired him and other Sons of Iraq fighters to be night guards in their Adhamiyah neighborhood. The men received a month of training but were let go with no pay, he said.
Like other Sons of Iraq members, he said, he felt safer when U.S. troops - their original sponsors - were in the country. "I want the Americans to be back," he said.

The will and 'The Wire'

BYLINE: Phil Zabriskie

SECTION: MAGAZINE; Pg. A13

LENGTH: 4085 words

Sonja Sohn stood in front of her audience, confident about the performance she was about to give. This wasn't surprising, considering her history as an actress who was just coming off a five-year run as Det. Shakima "Kima" Greggsג[#x2c6][#x161] on HBO's "The Wire," one of the most critically acclaimed shows in television history. To project professionalism, she had 'd pulled her hair back and was wearing pressed slacks and a collared shirt. Her motivation was clear, her research was done, and after many months of preparation, she was ready.  
ֲ¶ There was no script, though. Her "stage" was a classroom at the University of Maryland School of Social Workג[#x2c6][#x161], and her "audience" - made up of teenagers and young adults whose lives could have been    mined for  "The  Wire" - wasn't about to grant her anything based on her past credits. Not 18-year-old Tyrea Daniels, who guesses he had   been arrested eight or nine times by then for selling drugs and stealing cars; 16-year-old Latavia Cornish, who says she was "always outside, stealing, getting locked up"; or 21-year-old Sean Hawkins, who had  'd  been "thuggin' it up" since he dropped out of high school, "selling drugs, partying, stealing, robbing everything in sight." They and about 15 people from similar backgrounds were slouched in their chairs, warily eyeing Sohn and each other.
This was late in 2009, during the first session of ReWired for Life, a program Sohn had conceived of years earlier and devoted herself to building after "The Wire" signed off. She hadn't been ready to leave the show behind, neither what it stood for nor the Baltimore streets on which it had filmed. It was more than that, though. "I had an extraordinarily strong sense of purpose," she says, in the same half-purr, half-growl voice familiar to fans of "The Wire." "My entire life had become about this."
All of which meant little to Daniels, Cornish and Hawkins. It was cool to meet Kima because they had loved the show and loved seeing their reality depicted on screen. And free food was never a bad thing. Beyond that, they didn't expect much. They had all been  prodded to come by probation officers, counselors and parents. 
"We are talking about a throwaway population that adults think are too far gone," Sohn says later. "We're talking about kids that people have given up on over and over and over again. They don't feel like anyone is there for them. They may have parents who love them, but they've been falling back on themselves for so long that if you come in front of their faces talking, and not backing it up with action, you just become another one of the people who have disappointed them."
Sohn, then in her early 40s, was certain that if the right people came to ReWired at the right time, they could benefit immensely, maybe even transform their lives. She didn't expect it to happen in that first session, but she believed in herself, she believed in her plan, and she believed that transformation, even here, was possible. 
Hawkins, for one, wasn't buying it. He had grown up near Green Mount Cemetery on the east side, then over by Walbrook Junction on the west side. His father was in jail. His mother and her boyfriend encouraged him, but their voices faded when he stepped out the door and walked past one boarded-up house after another. He was clearly smart, but he quit school because the people he saw getting ahead - getting paid, getting girls, getting respect - were the guys in the game, hustling. After a string of arrests left him facing the possibility of a long prison stretch, however, he began to see things differently. He was about to become a father, and his girlfriend already had another child, meaning he was on the verge of abandoning his kids just like his father had done. He resolved to make changes, but GED programs and job hunting made him feel, he says, like "a blind man in a black room trying to find a black hat."
Sohn was offering to help, but he figured she must have had an angle. Why else would she be here? 
"A lot of the way I live my life has nothing to do with logic," Sohn says, but Hawkins didn't know that and didn't know how committed Sohn would prove to be. Sohn might not have known herself, actually. But she did believe that she could understand what these kids had been through -  because she'd been through it, too.
Landing the part of Kima was a huge break, but when filming started in 2002, Sohn was awash in anxiety, forgetting lines, feeling disoriented. She was a professional actress in her mid-30s. She had done this before. This shouldn't have been so hard.
But "The Wire" wasn't a typical TV series. Over five seasons,  it chronicled the uneven, often quixotic efforts of police, drug dealers, junkies, teachers, dock workers, kids and ex-cons to improve their lots. The show's writing team, led by former Baltimore Sun staffer David Simon and featuring former Baltimore detective and public school teacher Ed Burns, weren't trying to create entertainment per se, says Simon, but rather "a dialectic about urban issues and poverty, and the drug war and economics." They pursued authenticity above all else, ruthlessly refusing to provide happy endings and instead using language, location and narrative to pull viewers into a world of, as Simon puts it, "people who have been separated economically, socially, politically from the rest of America" - and then insisting that we all share stakes in, and responsibility for, the future we are building. 
For Sohn, though, the material was "kicking my whole thing up," she says. She had 'd grown up in Newport News, Va., in an area much like the Baltimore neighborhoods in which "The Wire" was set. Cops were not the good guys where she came from, so even acting the part was unnerving. The show's broader message made it palatable, says Simon. "I think that was a great relief to her, because I think she had some latent sense of horror that she was going to be working on a cop show as a cop," but the fractured lives in the script conjured barbed memories. Her father was an African American Army vet from the poor side of Winston-Salemג[#x2c6][#x161], N.C., her mother a Korean he had met while in the service who had grown up during the worst of the Korean War. Sohn was raised in a public housing project that resembled the West Baltimore low-rises the drug crew in "The Wire" controlled in the show's first season. There was a good deal of fighting in the streets and in her home. Her father was prone to violent rages during which he battered Sohn's mother and threatened to do worse. 
Home became a place of pure misery, even more so when a babysitter, an older girl, started molesting her. She wanted to run away but didn't want to leave her mother alone to endure her father's abuse. Ducking down a nearby alley, she'd write her thoughts on the wall with a broken piece of brick. Or she'd go to a school playground, climb a slide shaped like a rocket ship, and say, again and again, "It's going to get better," until one day, better wasn't enough. "It's going to be great!" she announced.
"I don't stay disempowered for long," she says. But while school, sports and poetry kept her going in her youth, she also started using and selling pot and cocaine. She managed to keep up her grades and hold a job through high school, though, then went to New York, where she started, but didn't finish, design college. She did, however, fall in love with and marry someone she describes as a nice, stable middle-class guy. They had two daughters together and lived comfortably in Brooklyn, but chaos was never far away. Her drug use continued, and her brother, who had drifted to North Carolina and had his own issues with drugs, was shot and killed after befriending a woman with a violently jealous boyfriend. 
Sohn realized she had to make some big changes. Intense therapy and painful self-reflection helped her get off drugs and recalibrate her life. Her marriage didn't survive, but what she calls her "healing" later involved mending hurts she had both endured and inflicted. Over time, she established good relationships with her ex, her daughters, even her parents - who, she came to think, did their best despite their own tumultuous upbringings. 
And she was grateful for her mother's devotion and the protection she tried to provide (she is now deceased). Sohn was grateful, too, for her father's encouragement and social justice teachings. He had always discussed the issues of the day with young Sonja, always pointed out political and civic leaders he admired for trying to improve the lives of others. The violence, she believes, stemmed from undiagnosed or mistreated mental illness, an outcropping of his youth - for years, he wasn't allowed to touch his tuberculosis-ridden mother - and his time in Korea. In later decades, he got treatment, found a supportive church and became a positive part of her life again.
Kima and Sonja persevered together, the character surviving a shooting, the actress settling into her role and then growing more invested in the real-life narratives all around her. 
 Simon and Burns, who had spent a year reporting on a single drug-strewn block to co-write a book called "The Corner," were both intimately familiar with the aching desperation and stagnant resignation afflicting much of Charm City. Brooklyn-born Jamie Hector, who played ascendant drug kingpin Marlo Stanfield, ran a nonprofit theater group in New York for at-risk youth. Gbenga Akinnagbe  ג[#x2c6][#x161] - a.k.a. Chris Partlow, Stansfield's dead-eyed hit man - was the son of Nigerian immigrants who spent part of his youth in homeless shelters before riding his wrestling skills to college. To them and others, the material was personal and important, part of something larger.
In 2008, after the final season, Sohn, Hector and Akinnagbe went to North Carolina to campaign for Barack Obama. Sohn was stunned to learn that their work on "The Wire" had bequeathed them a platform. "Something happened to her," Hector says. "I guess she realized the amount of change she could effect in the lives of young folks." 
Sohn started wondering: What if they took "The Wire" into schools, dissected how characters negotiated their environment and got kids to talk about how they did the same in their lives? Could that help them step outside themselves and see how they were making decisions, how there could be other possibilities? 
She shared the idea with Simon, saying she wanted to start an organization called ReWired for Change (ReWired for Life is its pilot program). "I was surprised," he says. Most TV and movie people who adopt a cause, he adds, "say a few words, they'll go to a dinner, they'll give some money, but this is time. Time is the ultimate expenditure." He gave his blessing but worried about how Sohn would raise money and whether she could succeed where even the best-intentioned Baltimoreans had not. "There was a part of me who wanted to put my arm around her and say" - he takes on an almost pitying tone - "you are about to go on a journey." 
Sohn gathered advice and support at the panels and the college classrooms that cast members from "The Wire" were frequently invited to. She cultivated local contacts and tapped Simon and "Wire" cast mates to join the board and give money. A few Baltimoreans held fundraisers. To cover shortfalls, Sohn figured, "I could drain myself until we got this thing off the ground."
ReWired for Life, she believed, should be community-based and grounded in both social justice and academic theory. Its facilitators needed credibility, so she recruited "Elder" Ted Sutton, who in the late 1980s had been a shotgun-toting lieutenant under legendary Baltimore drug kingpin Melvin Williams but now counseled gang members looking to get out of the game, and Greg "Shamsuddin" Carpenter, a convert to Islam who spent two decades in prison but now helped former inmates adjust to life on the outside. 
Both were there when Sohn met Hawkins, Daniels, Cornish and the others for the inaugural session and explained that they were embarking on four 12-week "modules." Initially, Sohn said, they'd focus on self-reflection, on ways "to become more aware of yourself and your history, and to understand how you got to where you are." The second module would break down "how you think and how your thinking informs your decision making." This was greeted with a collective shrug, but she pressed on. "The next couple of pieces revolve around your understanding of the world around you" - relationships and affiliations with everyone from friends and family to congregations and cops - and then "taking that critical-thinking model to the world around you, so you can give back."
They met twice a week, two hours per day. They watched parts of Season 1, which focused on the drug trade, and Season 4, which centered on the school system. Then, Sutton, Carpenter and Sohn tried to get the participants to discuss what they had seen and relate it to their own lives. Early on, the conversation was muted. That changed after they watched clips from Season 4 during which four eighth-graders - Naimond, Dukie, Randy and Michael - were coming of age and trying to negotiate the streets. The characters were starting to understand what they wanted, what they needed, and the extent to which they were on their own. That day, Hawkins recalls, "we all started to talk." 
Prompted by other episodes and other exercises in the ensuing weeks, they began sharing stories of fractured home lives, friends who had died, close calls and run-ins with the police. They talked about morality, cause and effect, decisions and consequences. Sohn never dismissed their responsibility, but she knew these were people shaped by events that unfolded over generations, people who developed skills they needed to survive, destructive though they may have been. Daniels, for instance, had been in foster care his entire life, moving from home to home, with no money, no real sense of security. "Tyrea has no family," Hawkins says with astonishment. "I've never met anyone who says, 'I have no family,' and they really mean it.
"I went out there to hustle because I wanted to, because I felt like doing it. He hustles because he has to. He robs because he has to."
Daniels himself recalls being urged to stay in school, but school was just another place he had to protect himself. "When I go to school, I got to watch my back," he says. And after school, "when I walk the streets, I got to watch my back." 
The group dwindled from 20 to 15, then 10. Those who stayed, though, grew more engaged. They knew that Carpenter, Sutton and, especially, Sohn didn't have to be there. Hawkins says a measure of trust developed. Toward the end of the session, Sohn and Carpenter led a field trip to North Carolina, stopping on the way in Newport News. "She showed us the project she came from, the school she went to," Daniels recalls. He says it  was like she was telling them: "I went through this, I got my [expletive] together," and they could, too.
The group became its own support network. When Cornish saw her uncle get shot and killed at a barbecue, and when Hawkins's younger stepbrother and another good friend were murdered while sitting on an East Baltimore stoop, they could reach out to others who understood what they were going through. In times past, Hawkins would have sought revenge, but he had taken to heart the lesson that "the choices you make lead to consequences." (He says the killer was later killed in prison.)
This wasn't Hawkins's last challenge, though. Sohn nominated him for a  mayoral anti-gang violence initiative, so he'd be receiving an award at City Hall. On the day of the ceremony, while waiting for Sutton to give him a ride, Hawkins got a call telling him that some guys had gone to his mother's house looking for his twin sister's boyfriend. Hawkins didn't know the whole story, but "my twin sister, that's everything to me," he says, the anger rising in his voice as he remembers. "When she calls, I come running, because she doesn't call me for something small." 
Sutton, an imposing man known as "Crazy Ted" in his gangster days, had gone through something similar when he was getting out of the game. On the eve of his college graduation, his crew wanted him to help take care of a rival. He said no, and the next day got his degree. He channeled that experience to counsel Hawkins, who Sutton could see was enraged and thinking about violence. As Sutton recalls: "I was like, 'Look, this is that fork in the road right now. You can already play this whole scenario out in your mind like a chess game.' " There'd be a confrontation, retribution, and someone would end up dead or in prison. 
"The 15 bus is right there," Sutton told him, pointing down the street. "You can go to your mother's house. Or you can get in this car with me." At the end of the day, "you can be looking at your award at home and happy, or you can be down at central booking."
 Sutton's words pierced Hawkins's rage. "I looked, and I thought, and I went on and did what I was supposed to do, because any setback would not take me forward in life," he says. "That would have taken me 10 steps back."
"The possibility of a different way of doing things - that's the key piece." Sutton says. "A lot of them, they don't even see another way." 
The second group skewed older and had different needs. Nikita Brady was exhausted from years spent on the corners, dealing, fighting, stealing. Her closest friend had been shot and killed. She had been told she could play basketball in college if she could get in, but "I didn't have that extra push, that motivation, until I met with Sonja," she says.
 "We started to see," Sohn said, "that although the program is very useful, if you don't have your GED, and you don't have a job, and you're 19 years old, and you're quitting drug dealingג[#x20ac]¦." She paused. "If in this very moment, you can't earn money to help yourself, the rest is a moot point." The participants needed practical life skills they could not learn watching "The Wire" - rsum writing, opening a bank account, handling job interviews, dealing with legal issues.
So Sohn put the third session on hold and started adapting the original vision. But a new opportunity arose. Maj. Melvin Russell, commander of Baltimore's Eastern District and an early backer, put Sohn in touch with Pastor Marshall Prentice of Zion Baptist Church in East Baltimore. Prentice said Sohn could use a house the church owned farther up East Lanvale Street if she fixed it up. It stood across from two vacant houses, near known drug corners, and it was yet another project to add to her to-do list. But she had long imagined having a house for the program to serve as an anchor in the community ReWired was trying to engage. 
Three months later, a large banner hung from the building, welcoming one and all to a free barbecue at the "Village House." The interior, once dingy and rundown, was now clean, airy and pleasant. Several dozen people gathered out front, and Sohn, in a burgundy dress, buzzed around shaking hands, dispensing hugs, telling people to get something to eat. Sutton was there - when a well-dressed lady said she had come from a funeral, he asked, "Young or old?" Hawkins was there, too. He had found work with a landscaping company but was hoping to find something that paid better. His wife, Shakiara, was about to start a short prison stint for fraud, so it was on him to care for the kids. 
Sohn soon started a new gig, too, as Det. Samantha Baker on ABC's "Body of Proof," a crime drama filming in Providence. It was a supporting role on a traditional cop show, but it was also a way to keep working and help fund ReWired. She was driving up and down Interstate 95 on a weekly basis, doing her scenes, then heading back to Baltimore. She sounded and looked tired.
Late in 2010 and into 2011, the third session remained on hold, and she was struggling to find the right people to manage ReWired and the Village House. Early in 2011, Daniels got arrested because he had held up an older couple at a bus stop after his foster mother had thrown him out and he had been homeless for several weeks. Sohn was heartened that he called her and said he knew he had done the wrong thing. It showed reflection and accountability, she thought, part of what she had been trying to instill. The group rallied around him, writing to him in jail, sending money, doing whatever they could - while also stressing that he had to make better choices. 
One night in March, Daniels, wearing a black Adidas tracksuit, arrived at the Village House for a ReWired meeting. He wouldn't be sentenced until the summer, but the weeks since he had gotten out of jail had been dispiriting. He was trying to look after his daughter, but job interviews kept stalling when his record came up. Plus, his sentencing judge had earlier said she'd give him 19 years if she saw him again. 
Brady was there. She had stepped up efforts to earn her GED because she had been told it would help her get a scholarship at a community college. Hawkins arrived with his son, still trying to find something better than his $7.50-an-hour landscaping gig. His wife was getting out of Jessup soon, but for the time being, "I'm a 24-hour pop!" he said. "It's nerve -racking. And a lot of brothers can't do it, and I lost a lot of friends because people would say the stupidest thing to me, like, 'Why don't you just give 'em to your mother, and you get out there and get yours?' " The answer was simple: "My father wasn't there for me, and he coulda been. There's nothing on this earth that could keep me from my son. And to know that everything I do for him and my family makes me a better person. And this program has made me see that there's another way."
In July, the ReWired crew gathered again at the Village House for a good-bye of sorts. "Body of Proof" was moving to Los Angeles - and Sohn with it. 
The gathering was orchestrated by Koli Tengalla, a veteran community activist and a fellow at the Open Society Institute whom Sohn hired to direct the Village House. The program was always designed to function without her. After she left, however, Hawkins, Brady and others asked for more responsibility and set up a snowball stand to raise funds to pay for GED tutoring for their classmates and school supplies for younger kids. 
After leaving prison, Shakiara Hawkins started interning at the Village House and was later hired as a full-time assistant. Sean Hawkins got a better paying job, too, in the warehouse of an event production company run by a man who met Sohn at her favorite Baltimore pub and offered his help. Brady was not only working; she had also enrolled at Baltimore County community college and was on the basketball team. Even Daniels had good news: He was sentenced to 61 days after the judge who said she'd give him 19 years was apparently swayed by his story, his pledge to honor his commitment to the court and his ReWired classmates, several of whom attended the sentencing. 
Even with the full schedule in California, and a rash of health issues that plagued her last fall, including a burst blood vessel in her colon that landed her in intensive care, Sohn is working closely with Tengalla to plan the next steps for the Village House, trying to develop a mental health piece for the program and trying to connect people like Hawkins and Brady with services ReWired can't provide, such as job counseling. She's also searching out new sources of funding and talking up the program in venues such as panel discussions at Harvard and Attorney General Eric Holder's "Defending Childhood" task force, chaired by former baseball manager Joe Torre. 
In December, soon after getting out of the hospital, she flew to Baltimore to testify at the task force's first hearing. Her voice shaky, she told her tale of transformation, stressing that she had done it, and that there are many kids in Baltimore and elsewhere who can do it - if they get the right help. 
It won't work every time, but "I know what is possible," she concluded.

Case turns the Justice Dept. on itself

BYLINE: Jerry Markon

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A03

LENGTH: 1637 words

Since it began a decade ago, the federal government's massive investigation of the 2001 anthrax attacks has been plagued by missteps and complications. 
Investigators initially focused on the wrong man, then had to pay him a nearly $6 million settlement. In 2008, they accused another man, Bruce E. Ivins, who killed himself before he could go to trial. 
Now, in the latest twist, the government has argued against itself. 
In documents deep in the files of a recently settled Florida lawsuit, Justice Department civil attorneys contradicted their own department's conclusion that Ivins was unquestionably the anthrax killer. The lawyers said the type of anthrax in Ivins's lab was "radically different" from the deadly anthrax. They cited several witnesses who said Ivins was innocent, and they suggested that a private laboratory in Ohio could have been involved in the attacks. 
The  spectacle of one arm of the Justice Department publicly questioning another could undermine one of the most high-profile investigations in years, according to critics and independent experts who reviewed the court filings.
"I cannot think of another case in which the government has done such an egregious about-face,'' said Paul Rothstein,  a law professor at Georgetown University. 
The documents were filed in a lawsuit over the October 2001 death of Robert Stevens, a Florida photo editor. His survivors accused the government of negligence for experimenting with anthrax at Fort Detrick; the case  lingered in court until the Justice Department settled it in November.
The case, Stevens v. United States, offers a rare glimpse inside a typically unified and notoriously tight-lipped agency that collided with itself in a particularly controversial investigation. While the guilt of Ivins is likely to be a subject of public speculation and intrigue for years to come, the government's inconsistency in the Stevens matter is sure to add another layer to that debate.
Justice Department prosecutors and FBI officials said they stand firmly behind their conclusions that Ivins prepared and mailed the anthrax-laced letters, which killed five people and terrified the nation just after Sept. 11, 2001. They said the civil filings were legal hypotheticals designed to shield the government from a negligence lawsuit filed by the family of an anthrax victim.
Yet last summer, when criminal investigators learned that their conclusions had apparently been challenged - and by their colleagues, no less - they were surprised and frustrated, leading to shouting matches within the department before it rushed to change portions of the filings, according to people familiar with the events.
Experts said that the civil lawyers went beyond the typical arguments attorneys make to avoid government liability, especially in a situation in which the Justice Department's criminal side had already accused Ivins.
"When there have been so many public statements about Ivins's guilt, someone higher up in the department should have seen this collision coming down the tracks,'' Rothstein said.

Confusion raised doubts
Critics said that the confusion has raised new doubts about the already disputed criminal investigation of Ivins. The Fort Detrick scientist committed suicide in 2008 as investigators were closing in on him, and the Justice Department closed the case in 2010.
The Stevens case documents "should put a gun to the case and explode it," said Meryl Nass, a physician who - along with many of Ivins's colleagues and some members of Congress - has long questioned his guilt.
Paul F. Kemp, a lawyer for Ivins, said the civil lawsuit creates "not just reasonable doubt" about Ivins's guilt but "millions of reasonable doubts."
Justice Department and FBI officials counter that the evidence remains overwhelming that Ivins alone sent the spore-laden letters to news media and two U.S. Senate offices, which also sickened 17 people. The department did not provide civil division lawyers to comment on the case. 
Department officials acknowledged that the civil filings appeared contradictory but attributed that to imprecise wording, some of which was corrected, and they said the civil attorneys were just doing their jobs.
"Whatever we say, there's always going to be some percent of the public that will say Ivins didn't do this," said Rachel Lieber, an assistant U.S. attorney in the U.S. Attorney's Office in the District who would have led the prosecution of Ivins. "People are entitled to their own views, but if you take a rational approach and look at the evidence, you come to the conclusion that it's overwhelming."
In defending the government against the Stevens lawsuit, civil lawyers tried to create distance between the Army lab where Ivins worked and the killer anthrax.
The lawyers wrote that the lab lacked the specialized equipment required to prepare the killer anthrax, a statement the Justice Department later retracted. They also cited a scientific report that had questioned the FBI's key conclusion linking Ivins's flask of anthrax spores to the attacks. 

Conflicts with criminal side
That conflicted with the department's criminal side, which had closely linked Ivins, his lab and the deadly anthrax. The FBI had strongly suggested Ivins prepared the killer spores in the lab, pointing to the anthrax he maintained there, highly sophisticated equipment in the facility and his unusual late-night hours around the time of the attacks. 
After the documents were filed publicly, the civil attorneys, who had not checked beforehand with the FBI or U.S. attorney's office, "got scolded, and rightly so," said one person familiar with the events, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe internal matters. "If you file something in court that you don't word perfectly and you have to go back and refile it, you should get yelled at for that."
Richard Schuler, an attorney for the Stevens family, said "there's no question" that the government's decision to avoid a trial in the civil case was related to the conflicting evidence. "They would have been in the position of potentially going against their own investigative agency, the FBI," he said.
The Justice Department initiated settlement discussions in August, about a month after filing its controversial motions, according to people familiar with the discussions. The settlement, finalized Nov. 28, paid $2.5 million to the Stevens family. 
Federal officials denied any relationship between their filings and the settlement and characterized it as a victory, since the family initially sought $50 million and the government did not admit liability.
Before the settlement, Schuler questioned under oath several scientists whom the government had put on a list of witnesses for the civil trial. In their depositions, William Russell Byrne and Gerard P. Andrews, Ivins's supervisors before and after the anthrax mailings, said they were virtually certain of his innocence. 
Byrne said Ivins didn't have the technical skill to make the extremely fine powder and both said the Fort Detrick lab's equipment could not have dried the anthrax so it could be turned into powder without contaminating parts of the facility.
Prosecutors and FBI officials disputed the contentions of the two scientists, saying in interviews that they were biased because they supervised Ivins and could have missed signs of his guilt. Though Byrne and Andrews were listed as government witnesses in the civil case, officials said they would never have been certified by a judge as experts under the stricter rules in the criminal system, which does not allow speculation.
Vincent B. Lisi, assistant special agent in charge of the FBI's Washington Field Office, said in an interview that Ivins, one of the nation's most respected anthrax experts, "absolutely had the ability" to make the deadly spores and that experiments by FBI scientists showed there would have been no contamination.
Byrne and Andrews, in interviews, said they continued to believe Ivins was not the killer. "It is deeply insulting and slanderous to suggest that we were just kind of covering our butts," said Byrne.
When Justice Department lawyers filed their July motions in the civil case, they wrote that the deadly powder would have required a certain amount of liquid anthrax - and the liquid content of anthrax created by Ivins and stored in a flask labeled RMR-1029 wasn't nearly enough. 
And though the department's criminal side had said all other suspects were ruled out, the civil lawyers said portions of RMR-1029 had been sent before the attacks to Battelle, the Ohio-based lab. They raised a possible scenario in which the attack anthrax could have come from the anthrax at that lab or other labs to which Battelle may have transferred the spores.
Katy Delaney, a spokeswoman for Battelle, did not respond directly to the government filings, but said "the Stevens case against Battelle was dismissed and the [criminal] investigation of Battelle has been closed."
Justice Department and FBI officials reiterated in interviews that they exhaustively investigated the 42 people at Battelle with access to the anthrax and ruled them out as suspects. 
Four days after their disputed filings, Justice Department civil lawyers tried to file a "notice of errata," and soon made a number of corrections and clarifications. In September, the civil lawyers filed a sworn FBI declaration with nearly 60 points reaffirming Ivins's guilt. 
Stephen A. Saltzburg, a law professor at George Washington University and former Justice Department official, said the department was right to pull the plug on the civil case but should have done so earlier.
"It would have been treacherous for them to litigate this, to answer all the questions their own pleadings raised,'' he said. "In many ways, it was the government arguing against itself.''

Ever since making his debut in 1999 with "_blankThings You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her," Rodrigo Garcia has carved out a singular niche in Hollywood as a director who has a special touch with women. In that first film, an omnibus of intersecting vignettes about disparate women living in Los Angeles, he worked with an ensemble that included Glenn Close, Holly Hunter, Kathy Baker and a surprisingly serious Cameron Diaz in one of the first roles that proved she was more than a piece of blond camera candy.
Garcia's next film, 2005's "_blankNine Lives," was a similarly structured study of women's experiences, again featuring Close and Hunter but also starring a very young Dakota Fanning and Amanda Seyfried, as well as Robin Wright Penn, who delivered a memorable, virtually wordless performance as a former party girl who runs into an old flame at a supermarket. In 2009, he made "_blankMother and Child," starring Naomi Watts and Annette Bening as an adopted daughter and a birth mother, respectively. It's no wonder that by that time Garcia was being compared to George Cukor, whose sensitivity with women characters and female-driven stories made him a favorite with such stars as Katharine Hepburn and Joan Crawford. 
Now, with "_blankAlbert Nobbs," Garcia delivers a twist on the material he's spent a career mastering. In the film, Close stars as a woman in 19th-century Ireland who gets work at a Dublin hotel by passing as a man. Based on a play (also starring Close) adapted from a short storyby George Moore, "Albert Nobbs" co-stars Janet McTeer as a friend of Close's title character, who also passes as a man but who lives in a functional marriage with another woman. A clutch of good reviews and notices for both Close and McTeer's performances culminated last week in Oscar nominations for both actresses.
It's difficult to think of a male director other than Garcia - whom Close calls "just a big bear of a sexy, warm man" - who could understand the nuances, not just of being a woman in a man's world, but a woman impersonating a man in a man's world.
"The question of female identity is still incredibly fertile," Garcia said over lunch at the Toronto International Film Festival, where "Albert Nobbs" had its world premiere in September. "What are you, apart from mother, daughter, wife, sister? I find that infinitely fascinating."
If Garcia has become the "women's director" in Hollywood, he added, "it's not what I set out to do for myself. The ideas just come to me, and they always start with, 'There's a woman who . . .' I don't know what it is. Jason Isaacs, the guy who played with Robin Wright in 'Nine Lives,' said to me the first day that I met him, 'You write about women because it allows you to address emotional subjects emotionally, and you can hide behind that.' I was a little shocked - it's like being told that you need to lose weight. But he was right. I like emotional subjects.
"My movies are so autobiographical that sometimes when we're shooting them I'm behind the camera and I shrink with embarrassment," he continued. "It's like pulling my pants down. Even if it's a woman talking about her job, going to the supermarket, whether she adopted a child or wants to marry this person - it's so personal, but it's completely dramatized." (Garcia, 52, lives in Los Angeles with his wife, an elementary school teacher, and two daughters.)
Close attributes Garcia's affinity for women's stories to "his DNA. He grew up with a great mother and a wonderful grandmother and lots of aunts, and he's been surrounded by strong, interesting women," she said. "Anybody can blow up cars. A director who can really get into the mysteries and complexity of women is very special."
 Garcia grew up in Mexico, the son of a mother he describes as "a potent force" and a father who happened to be the novelist Gabriel Garcia Marquez. "My father came to Mexico to write screenplays, and I think he also had the desire to direct movies, although fortunately for him that didn't pan out," he said. Indeed, at the beginning of his career, Garcia underplayed the connection with his famous father; it's only recently, while working with HBO - especially "Carnivale" and "Six Feet Under" - that he's begun playing with magical realism more associated with his father: "supernatural stuff, fantasies, the dead talk[ing] to the living, all that stuff that I've avoided."
For the most part, though, Garcia's signature is modern-day realism, from which the spare, period-authentic "Albert Nobbs" strikes a marked departure. Still, Garcia considers it just as deeply personal as his previous films. "I feel a little bit like Nobbs," he said. "Everyone has this secret person inside, everyone is [doing] a performance. Also, machismo is so horrible that sometimes I feel like I'm less of a man because I make these movies about women, and I continue to do it because I can't help it. But a part of me sometimes feels like I'm an inadequate guy. When people say to me, 'You're the George Cukor of your generation' I think, 'Gay?' And that's because that's where we are. I'm proud of it, but part of me thinks, 'Oh, I'm less of a guy than those guys who make the real movies.
"I do have a couple of scripts that I'm trying to get off the ground that have men in the lead," he continued. "In fact, one of them has almost not a single woman in it. 
"It's so hard to write about men without anyone invading Poland or blowing up a building or killing a lion," he said resignedly before talking about his next project. "It's a series for the Internet," he said enthusiastically. "A series of 12 six- or seven-minute episodes that are all about the lives of women."

Indeed, at the beginning of his career, Garcia underplayed the connection with his famous father; it's only recently, while working with HBO - especially "Carnivale" and "Six Feet Under" - that he's begun playing with magical realism more associated with his father: "supernatural stuff, fantasies, the dead talk[ing] to the living, all that stuff that I've avoided."
For the most part, though, Garcia's signature is modern-day realism, from which the spare, period-authentic "Albert Nobbs" strikes a marked departure. Still, Garcia considers it just as deeply personal as his previous films. "I feel a little bit like Nobbs," he said. "Everyone has this secret person inside, everyone is [doing] a performance. Also, machismo is so horrible that sometimes I feel like I'm less of a man because I make these movies about women, and I continue to do it because I can't help it. But a part of me sometimes feels like I'm an inadequate guy. When people say to me, 'You're the George Cukor of your generation' I think, 'Gay?' And that's because that's where we are. I'm proud of it, but part of me thinks, 'Oh, I'm less of a guy than those guys who make the real movies.
"I do have a couple of scripts that I'm trying to get off the ground that have men in the lead," he continued. "In fact, one of them has almost not a single woman in it. 
"It's so hard to write about men without anyone invading Poland or blowing up a building or killing a lion," he said resignedly before talking about his next project. "It's a series for the Internet," he said enthusiastically. "A series of twelve six- or seven-minute episodes that are all about the lives of women."

10 killed in pileup on hazy highway 
A long line of cars and trucks collided early Sunday on a dark Florida highway so shrouded in haze and smoke that drivers were instantly blinded. At least 10 people were killed.
When rescuers arrived, they could only listen for screams and moans because the poor visibility made it difficult to find victims in the wreckage that was strewn for nearly a mile, police said.
Authorities were still trying to determine what caused the pileup south of Gainesville on Interstate 75, which had been closed for a time before the accidents because of the mixture of fog and heavy smoke from a brush fire that may have been intentionally set. At least a dozen cars and six tractor-trailers were involved, and some burst into flames.
Steven R. Camps of Gainesville said he and some friends were driving home several hours before dawn when they were drawn into the pileup. 
"You could hear cars hitting each other. People were crying. People were screaming. It was crazy," he said. "If I could give you an idea of what it looked like, I would say it looked like the end of world."
Authorities had not released the names of victims Sunday evening, but said one passenger car had four fatalities and a "tour-bus-like" vehicle also was involved in the pileup.
At least 18 people were taken to a hospital.
All six lanes of the interstate - which runs virtually the entire length of Florida - were closed most of Sunday afternoon as investigators surveyed the site and firefighters put out the last of the flames.
The northbound lanes of I-75 were reopened around 5:30 p.m., but the southbound lanes remained closed.

Police called to home find 5 dead  
Police found five people dead inside a Birmingham home when they arrived early Sunday morning to investigate a possible robbery, authorities said.
Birmingham police Sgt. Johnny Williams said officers arrived at the house around 3:30 a.m. Sunday after getting a call that a robbery was in progress and soon discovered the five victims. He told reporters that investigators are interviewing potential witnesses but so far have made no arrests.
"Someone out there knows more information," Williams said. "We know someone is going to do the right thing."
The victims were not immediately identified, nor was the cause of death released. Birmingham authorities began a homicide investigation and police think that more than one person was involved in the crime.
 "It obviously appears to us this horrific crime was not a random act of violence," said Birmingham Police Chief A.C. Roper.

Suspect in slayings had past problems 
A man accused of killing his girlfriend in Georgia and then gunning down a police officer in South Carolina had been dealing with mental problems, the man's father said.
Police in South Carolina said Joshua Tremaine Jones, 26, faces charges of murder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime in the death of Aiken Public Safety Department Master Cpl. Sandra Rogers. He is expected to appear in court in Aiken on Monday, according to Magistrate Judge Tracey Carroll.
The South Carolina Law Enforcement Division said that Rogers was shot Saturday morning while responding to a report of suspicious activity. The 49-year-old had spent nearly 28 years with the Aiken police force.
Jones was arrested hours later in Batesburg.
James Jones, the suspect's father, told reporters that his son had past run-ins with the law and "was going through some mental problems," though he didn't elaborate on those problems. Jones said his son had run away from home and moved in with his girlfriend. He said his son is from North Augusta and briefly lived in Atlanta.
In neighboring Georgia, the Augusta Chronicle reported Jones also faces murder charges in the death of his girlfriend, Cayce Vice, 21. Police found her body in her apartment Saturday morning after she didn't show up for work at a Five Guys restaurant. She had been shot in the head.

Officer facing arrest fatally shot by colleague: A police officer from Santa Maria, Calif., who was suspected of having a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old girl was shot and killed by a fellow officer as he was about to be arrested, authorities said. The officer was near the end of his shift at a DUI checkpoint when supervisors arrived after 1 a.m. Saturday to detain him, Police Chief Danny R. Macagni told reporters at a news conference. There was a struggle, the suspected officer drew his gun and fired it, and a fellow officer then shot him in the chest, Macagni said.
"He chose to resist," Macagni said. "He drew his weapon. A fight ensued. He fired his weapon. And one of my officers that was there also discharged his weapon, and the officer was fatally wounded."
The suspected officer - whose father and sister identified him to KCOY-TV in Santa Maria as Albert Covarrubias Jr., 29 - was married and was a four-year member of the department. He was pronounced dead at Marian Medical Center after undergoing emergency surgery. No one else was injured.
Missing girl's blood found in Maine home: Some of the blood found in a Maine home where a missing toddler was last seen six weeks ago belonged to the girl, an official said.
State police spokesman Steve McCausland said Saturday that the blood was found early in the investigation of Ayla Reynolds's disappearance from her father's Waterville home.
McCausland said Sunday that some of the blood found in the home belonged to Ayla. He declined to discuss how much blood was found, where it was found or how long it might have been there.
Her father, Justin DiPietro, says Ayla was not in her bed when he checked on her the morning of Dec. 17.
A Web site run by Ayla's mother's family says that the despite the evidence, the family is  "more determined than ever to find out what has happened to Ayla" and is still clinging to the hope that she is alive.
Assault charges dismissed against woman in boy's death: A Massachusetts judge has dismissed assault charges against the fiancee of a man accused of fatally beating his 7-year-old son on Father's Day 2009.
Some Vassar applicants incorrectly told they were accepted: Dozens of applicants to Vassar College were mistakenly told they had gotten into the school when they checked a Web site that had been set up for students applying for early decisions.
The school, in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., said 76 students logged on to the site after 4 p.m. Friday and saw letters saying they had been accepted when in fact they had not.
The school says it fixed the mistaken information by 4:30 p.m. and informed the affected applicants of the mistake by Friday evening. Forty-six students who logged on had been correctly told they were accepted.

Crash after chase kills 2, sends 3 to hospital

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B03

LENGTH: 336 words

Two men were killed and three people were injured, including two D.C. police officers, when the driver of a minivan being pursued by one police car in Northeast Washington lost control and sent the vehicle tumbling onto another police car. 
Cmdr. James Crane said the incident began shortly before 3 a.m. Sunday, when police responding to 911 calls reporting gunfire were flagged down by an unidentified man in the 700 block of Otis Place NW. The man told officers that people in a burgundy Plymouth minivan with Virginia tags had just shot at him. He was not injured.
No sooner had the lookout been broadcast over the radio than officers in a second car on Upshur Street NW saw a van matching the description run a stop sign, Crane said. The police officers gave chase. When they reached the 400 block of Taylor Street NE, the minivan crested a hill and the driver lost control, police said. The vehicle tumbled and struck a tree. All three occupants were ejected as it rolled, Crane said.
Simultaneously, a third police car was approaching the scene from the opposite direction. As that car came up the hill, officers saw the minivan lose control, and the cruiser pulled over to the side of the street to wait, Crane said.
The minivan landed on the hood of the third police car before sliding off and coming to a halt. It has not been determined how fast the van was traveling when it lost control.
Crane said two men who were in the minivan died. The name of one is being withheld pending notification of next of kin, and police have not identified the other.
A 17-year-old youth who was in the vehicle was taken to a hospital with critical injuries, Crane said. Police are withholding his name because he is a juvenile.
The two officers were taken to a hospital for injuries that are not considered life-threatening.
Police said they think the minivan was involved in the shooting, Crane said, but police do not know of anyone who was shot. They are asking anyone with information to call 202-727-9099.

Focus on mental health, not guns

SECTION: EDITORIAL COPY; Pg. A16

Gun control as an issue has little to do with the shooter in Tucson who attacked then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) or the one at the Virginia Tech massacre or even John Hinckley Jr. ["To honor Rep. Giffords," editorial, Jan. 24].  
In all of these cases, the issue being ignored is that of mental health and the lack of funds or means to treat these severely ill people. If you find a way to take these people off the street and get them the help they need before the shooting begins, the problem is solved.
Gun control, on the other hand, should be about keeping guns out of the hands of criminals - i.e., street thugs, drug dealers and gang members - and making sure that the good citizens of this country keep their right to be properly armed, in order to help keep the peace, pursuant to the Second Amendment of the Constitution.

A collision course in Russia

DATELINE: MOSCOW

MOSCOW -  The opposition movement that began to emerge here after last month's parliamentary elections is dashing toward its next confrontation with the authorities this week, trying to rally supporters, develop strategy and groom leaders as it goes along.
Mostly young, middle class and without political affiliation, they are organizing in pursuit of fair elections and honest government. The authorities are preparing to head them off. 
The next test is Saturday's march, which the opposition wants to make bigger and more impressive than a rally last month in which about 100,000 demonstrators gathered in peaceful determination on a broad Moscow avenue. 
City officials initially refused to grant a permit for the upcoming march, saying they would consider a different day and place, but granted permission last week for 50,000 marchers. If more turn up, they risk being hauled away to jail by the riot police. If fewer appear, the demonstration looks less than successful.
The scarcity of experienced opposition leaders is one testament to Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's success. His United Russia party dominates the political landscape, even though it dipped from 63 percent of the vote in the 2007 parliamentary elections to just under 50 percent in December.
He made it impossible for any but approved parties to acquire legal status and field candidates. No serious, organized political opposition has been allowed to emerge. Even the most appealing new faces, such as blogger Alexei Navalny,with his large following among the young middle class, have little leadership experience.
Inexperience, supporters of the opposition argue, is a virtue. Earlier this month, 16 writers, musicians, television personalities and journalists much admired by the protest crowds formed a League of Voters. They are helping to organize the rally, but their larger purpose is to recruit and train election observers and educate voters in an effort to improve government. Their membership is open to everyone except politicians, which excludes Navalny. 
Yuri Shevchuk, a famous rock musician from St. Petersburg who joined the league, celebrated their inexperience. 
"There is a saying that the Titanic was built by professionals and Noah's Ark by amateurs," he said. "We are amateurs here. Let's see what we can do."

'Dirty tricks'
While the opposition is getting its bearings and hoping to turn out enough protesters to get the Kremlin's attention - their clout lies in their numbers - Putin appears to be waiting to see whether they will gather steam or lose it.
He has an entrenched bureaucracy behind him and supporters who have not been reluctant in the past to play dirty tricks and worse. Already, attempts have been made to discredit several of the opposition leaders. Two different sets of tapes recording opposition members in unflattering conversations have floated out. One of those who was taped, a Duma deputywho formerly served in the KGB, estimated that the operation to trap him on tape cost $300,000.
Putin, who served as president from 2000 to 2008 and stepped down because of term limits, is seeking a return to the country's highest office in March elections. Last week, the landlord renting office space to Golos, the only independent election monitor, informed the organization that the electricity would be turned off for repairs from Jan. 25 to March 6, two days after the vote. 
Mark Galeotti, a New York University expert on organized crime, security and modern Russia, said the authorities are most likely to resort to covert means to tame the opposition.
"If the next rounds of protest show greater numbers," he said, "I would see many more dirty tricks, the FSB unleashed. We won't see apartment blocks blown up again."
In 1999, four apartment buildings in Moscow and two other cities were blown up, killing nearly 300 people. The attacks were blamed on Chechens and used to garner support for a second war with that region. 
Eventually a former KGB agent, Alexander Litvinenko, accused the KGB, now the FSB, of carrying out the bombings. He died from plutonium poisoning in London in 2006, a death widely regarded as connected to the security services seeking revenge.

Putin's dilemma
Olga Kryshtanovskaya, a sociologist and member of Putin's United Russia party, said his inner circle has opposing views on what to do. 
"If he's too tough, there might be an explosion," she said. "It could increase the risk of revolution. If he's not tough enough, he risks losing the support of the elite. No matter what move he makes, it's a bad one."
Galeotti calculates that the government has nearly 100,000 men with guns, including police, riot police, soldiers, special forces and others, in and near Moscow. Force is very much available. 
But any extreme use of it, he says, would be domestically and internationally disastrous, costing Putin a huge amount of support: The drift toward democracy may be slow, but it is  inevitable and too hard to put down.
"I think Putin's going to win the election," Galeotti said, "but lose the war."

Gingrich delivers 'wild and woolly'

BYLINE: Stephanie McCrummen

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A01

LENGTH: 1675 words

DATELINE: SARASOTA, FLA.

SARASOTA, Fla. - In a cavernous airplane hangar, an emcee warmed up a restless crowd.
"If you're going to take on the establishment, you can't be namby-pamby . . .ג[#x20ac][#x160]!" he began as people cheered and waved little American flags.
"Let's send Obama back to Chicago!" he went on, and a gray-haired woman yelled, "You mean out of the country!" and an elderly man shouted, "Yeah!" and a younger woman held up a homemade sign that read "Newt-er Obama!"
"Throw the dogs a bone!" a man in neatly creased khakis blurted out, and soon people began chanting the name of the candidate they believe could give them the brawl they were spoiling for.
"Newt! Newt! Newt! Newt!" 
As the country anthem "Only in America" swelled, a blue bus delivered the white-haired presidential contender, a man whose up-and-down 40-year career has been defined by his eagerness to play the warrior in audacious, often destructive political battles.
"You have to imagine looking out over this crowd," said Newt Gingrich, a student of the Japanese samurai warlord Toranaga, the Turkish revolutionary Kemal Ataturk and the Chinese military strategist Sun-tzu, among others. "And what it does to make you feel GOOD!"
More than 2,000 supporters cheered in Gingrich's largest gathering yet.
On the eve of Florida's increasingly raucous GOP primary, Gingrich is settling once more into the familiar, against-all-odds role he's always relished, from his storied days as House speaker to his early campaigns to his childhood, when the chubby, awkward Newtie would pretend to get beat up by a friend and lie on the sidewalk until a car pulled up.
"Newt would jump up and scream 'Surprise!'ג[#x20ac][#x160]" the friend told Time magazine in 1995, adding that it was always Newt who wanted to play dead.
As the Republican establishment mounts attacks denouncing him as too erratic to be president, Gingrich has seemed only more energized. Despite slipping in Florida's polls, he has vowed a "wild and woolly" primary battle that will end with his victory. And on Sunday, he and Mitt Romney traded their harshest attacks yet, with Romney telling Gingrich to "look in the mirror" if he wants to understand his slide in the polls, and Gingrich slugging back, calling Romney a "pro-abortion, pro-gun-control, pro-tax-increase moderate."
In many ways, Gingrich was operating on the harsh political battlefield he helped create.
"He relishes confrontation, the engagement, the challenge, the one-on-one, the whole thing - he would have made a great gladiator," said Eddie Mahe Jr., a former Republican Party official who worked with Gingrich in the 1980s.
"One of the keys to Newt is that he's always seen politics as war," said John Pitney Jr., a professor at Claremont McKenna College who has written about Gingrich. "What I see now is just an older version of the younger Gingrich. He hasn't changed radically, to use one of his favorite words. He's still audacious."

An audacious proposition
Gingrich's political career began with the audacious proposition that a Republican could win in the solidly Democratic Georgia district outside Atlanta. His first two tries failed. Running for Congress in 1974 and '76, he first faced an electorate soured on Republican President Richard Nixon's impeachment, and then swept up in the Democratic tide led by Georgian Jimmy Carter. They were the first two "nos" in a political career staked on overcoming them.
In 1978, Gingrich tried again, jumping on the wave of a revived conservative movement and launching a tough - some have said vicious - campaign against a popular Democrat.
"I'm from Virginia and we had a long talk about the difference between Virginia politics and Georgia politics," recalled Carlyle Gregory, his campaign manager at the time. "Virginia is a very patrician state. Newt gave me a book on Eugene Talmadge," he said, referring to the populist, segregationist Georgia politician. "And he said, 'Read this.' He told me one thing I had to understand about Georgia politics is that half of it is theater . . . that you have to get audiences revved up."
Gingrich and his team dug up several bills that his opponent, Virginia Shapard, had voted against - sloppily drawn legislation, some said - that had aimed to cut taxes and monitor welfare recipients. One of the resulting ads showed a woman's hefty arm - Shapard was overweight - doling out cash and a voice accusing her of giving money to welfare cheats. Another showed the arm stamping "No" on the tax-cut bill. Another suggested that by going to Washington, Shapard was breaking up her family.
In contrast, Gingrich cast himself and the wife he would soon divorce as ordinary people struggling to pay their bills and keep the family together.
While some on his staff counseled releasing the harsh ads quietly, Gingrich did the opposite.
"Newt said 'Let's have a press conference to launch them,'ג[#x20ac][#x160]" recalled Frank Gregorsky, who worked for Gingrich from 1978 until 1983. "He knew it was going to take buzz bombs to break up the Democratic majority. You had to do things like that - start a controversy."
It worked, and the underdog had his first political victory using a polarizing technique he continued to preach. As a party leader, he advised Republican candidates to define Democrats in negative terms, and famously distributed a list of acidic words - among them traitor, radical, pathetic and sick - that have become a regular part of political discourse.
In Sarasota last week, Gingrich smiled at the mostly white, mostly elderly crowd.
He cast himself as a defender of "classic America" and Obama as a believer in "Saul Alinsky radicalism" to huge cheers.
"I studied history - although, unlike the president, I studied American history!" Gingrich said to roaring applause.
"This president has been the best food-stamp president in history!" he went on.
"Yes! Yes!" yelled a man in a straw hat.
"This will be an American campaign!" Gingrich said.
"Yeah!" shouted the man in pressed khakis, Bob Cunningham, 59, who said he liked Gingrich because "Newt throws red meat, and we're rabid. We want our country back."
Bartender Adele Ober, 47, nodded.
"I don't think Obama is for America," she said. "He's a landlord for handouts."
She liked Gingrich, she said, because he said what she was thinking.
"Hardworking Americans are angry," she said. "We don't need a softy right now."

Start of political fame
In the annals of his rise to power, Gingrich's brazen, 1984 confrontation with Democratic House Speaker Tip O'Neill marked the start of his political fame and, many argue, a steady decline in political civility.
It began with the arrival of C-SPAN cameras in Congress, which Gingrich used as a platform to launch attacks against his Democratic colleagues. Although the House chamber was empty, Gingrich railed before a television audience, accusing lawmakers of being "blind to communism" and spreading "communist propaganda."
O'Neill finally struck back, harshly rebuking Gingrich before the full House for questioning his colleagues' patriotism. But instead of retreating, Gingrich escalated, repeating his attacks and accusing O'Neill of "a McCarthyism of the left." O'Neill roared that Gingrich's tirades were "the lowest thing that I've ever seen in my 32 years in Congress."
But Gingrich punched back again. His Republican allies had O'Neill's words - deemed a personal attack - struck from the record. Gingrich made the evening news.
"I am now a famous person," he told reporters.
"He learned that if you can strike an opponent and survive, you can make yourself bigger and stronger," Pitney said.
It was a lesson Gingrich carried forward as he took down Democratic House Speaker Jim Wright on ethics charges, challenged a stunned President George H.W. Bush over tax increases, and, as House speaker, battled with President Bill Clinton over the federal budget and shut down the government - a calculation that led to Gingrich's decline in popularity.
Under pressure from Republican colleagues, Gingrich resigned as speaker in 1998.

Battling back
But after a lucrative semi-exile, after entering the presidential race, after tanking in Iowa, then surging, then tanking, then surging again, and after recent days of attacks from Republicans, Gingrich is battling back again.
A day after the Sarasota rally, his bus rolled up to another muster, slightly smaller, in the parking lot of Wings Plus restaurant in Coral Springs.
Cinematic music swelled and people cheered in the sunshine, some with "Newt-er Obama" buttons pinned to brightly colored golf shirts: A grinning Gingrich held up two of the "O" logos from Obama's campaign.
Those in the crowd waved and occasionally clenched hands into fists.
"I watched the president's State of the Union address last night," Gingrich began, "and I was . . . "
"Sick!" a man yelled out.
Gingrich chuckled and went on about Obama being a radical and the biggest food-stamp president ever and finally challenging the president to a series of "Lincoln-Douglas-style debates."
If Obama refuses, Gingrich said, he'd chase him wherever he went, an image that drew triumphant cheers from the crowd.
"You'll have to go to Kenya!" a man yelled, referring to Obama's father's birthplace, and soon the people began chanting "Newt, Newt, Newt, Newt!"
"You guys are cruel," Gingrich said at one point, smiling. "We want to run an American campaign!"
"Yeah!" yelled Claudio Klestel, jabbing a fist toward the blue sky.
Later, Klestel, an AT&T worker, explained that he had arrived at the rally undecided, but after hearing Gingrich, he was with him. He was ready for a Newt-Obama brawl.
"Oh yeah, I can't wait - I'm ready for Newt to debate Obama," said Klestel, 49. "I'm an NFL fan and now that the season is over, this is what I'm going to watch . . . Newt putting Obama in his place."
Nearby, a man holding a sign that read "Welcome to the Obama Depression" concurred.
"It would be like Muhammad Ali in his prime going against Mister Rogers," said Ken Payne, a retiree. Gingrich "would slice and dice him," he said.
"It's what the country wants," Payne said. "Those who love this country."

It should have noted that Toranaga is a fictional character in the James Clavell novel "Shogun." The article also incorrectly referred to impeachment of President Richard M. Nixon. Nixon resigned rather than face impeachment over the Watergate scandal.

Alexandria activist was shot before being dumped in well

The missing Alexandria activist whose body was recovered from a well in Fort Washington on Saturday had been shot to death, authorities said Monday.
Homicide detectives have not determined exactly when and where Lenwood "Lenny" Harris, 53, was slain, although they think he was killed soon after he disappeared in September, Prince George's County Police Chief Mark Magaw said at a news conference. Magaw said Harris's body was dumped down the well on a vacant property in the 11900 block of Old Fort Road after he died. 
An anonymous 911 call tipped detectives off to the body Thursday, authorities said. That launched a days-long excavation process that ended Saturday when evidence technicians brought Harris's remains above ground.
Detectives are working to track down suspects and a motive. They seem to have several leads: A tattooed man was caught on an ATM surveillance camera using Harris's bank card hours after he disappeared, and police found Harris's cellphone on the Woodrow Wilson Bridge.
Harris, who lived with his wife in Del Ray, was well known for popping in on Alexandria City Council meetings to discuss issues and city recreation centers to help kids. He made an unsuccessful run for the council in 2007 and co-founded the nonprofit Operation H.O.P.E., which offers mentoring and career development services. He also ran a pest-control business.
Tony Suggs, a longtime friend of Harris's who was among the last people to see him alive, said he didn't know "what to say or what to think" about the fact that his friend was killed. He said he knew Harris as a strong leader who helped Suggs personally in his battle to stay off drugs, and he hoped others would continue the work that Harris started.
"I just feel as though we lost a good community leader," Suggs said. "But Lenny's time here hasn't been in vain because he laid a lot out. He did a lot of positive things throughout the community."
Magaw said Monday that investigators were working to identify the 911 caller. He said whoever dumped the body in the well "obviously knows the area" because it is secluded and the home on the property has been vacant since 1996.
Prince George's homicide detectives are working with the Alexandria police.
At Monday's news conference, Alexandria Police Chief Earl Cook said that he knew Harris personally and that his thoughts were with the activist's family.
"Mr. Harris actually greatly affected Alexandria," Cook said.
Harris was last seen Sept. 21 at the Charles Houston Recreation Center in Alexandria, Cook said. Suggs, who talked with him there, said Harris seemed mostly normal, although later, when detectives talked to him about his friend's cellphone use that evening, it struck him that Harris seemed to check his phone frequently.
A reward of up to $38,000 is being offered for information that leads to an arrest and conviction in the case. Those with information are asked to call the Prince George's police homicide unit at 301-772-4925.

When the Big Muddy ran backward

BYLINE: W. Barksdale Maynard by W. Barksdale Maynard

SECTION: HEALTH; Pg. E01

LENGTH: 1254 words

As mighty forests cracked and shattered and the Mississippi River flowed backward, the settlers of New Madrid, Mo., thought it was doomsday. Their accounts are frightening to read: the landscape undulating like a shaken carpet, rising and falling in waves 15 feet high. Widespread flooding as the earth broke. Fissures shooting "vast volumes of water and sand . . . as high as the tops of the trees."
With the 200th anniversary of the New Madrid earthquakes this winter, scientists and emergency planners are asking: Could all this happen again?
The New Madrid temblors knocked chimneys off log cabins in the wilderness and drowned passengers on riverboats. Today they might crumble buildings from St. Louis to Memphis, rupture natural gas pipelines, wrench bridges into the Big Muddy, traumatize an estimated 12 million people.  
The Federal Emergency Management Agency warns of a possible$300 billion in economic losses across eight states, should a magnitude 7.7 earthquake strike near New Madrid. (After the 1812 temblor, Congress doled out $50,000 to settlers, the first disaster relief in American history.)

How strong was it? 
The New Madrid quakes started nine days before Christmas in 1811 and culminated in a massive shock on Feb. 7, 1812, which some experts believe was one of the largest quakes ever to strike the center of a continent.  
Mid-continent events, far from plate boundaries such as the so-called Ring of Fire along which California trembles, are poorly understood. They can be just as destructive: The 1556 disaster in Shaanxi, China, had the highest death toll of any quake in history, an estimated 830,000. They happen along a crazy quilt of faults and hence are unpredictable. And they can be widely separated in time: Last August's magnitude 5.8 quake at Mineral, Va., which damaged the Washington Monument and other buildings in the District, was the biggest in that seismic zone since 1875.
No one knows exactly what caused the New Madrid region - the name is pronounced "New MAH-drid" - to strain and rupture. And because there were no instruments recording the event, scientists disagree about how powerful the convulsions were. Recent estimates  range from below 7 up to nearly 8. 
We know that New Madrid jolted sleepers awake on the East Coast. President James Madison wrote Thomas Jefferson that the Feb. 7 tremor hit a few minutes after 4 a.m. at the White House, 700 miles from the epicenter, and "lasted several minutes." To some scientists, this suggests a magnitude closer to 8 than to 7.
To get a better sense of what happened at New Madrid and whether a similar shock is likely to recur, paleoseismologist Martitia Tuttle looks for the fingerprints an earthquake leaves on the landscape. The Mississippi's muddy floodplain, subject to  erosion and soil movement, obscures faults at the surface. But there is another kind of evidence: patches of sand that in many places mottle the wide fields like a rash. Scientists call them  sand blows.
During the quakes of 1811-12, pressurized water and sand spurted up from underground and left deposits at the surface. Tuttle and her scientific partners are adept at finding these old sand blows on riverbanks - she has paddled or motored along 895 miles of snake-infested backwaters - or from the air.
She slices into sand blows with shovel and backhoe, exposing the clogged fissures through which the sand once gushed upward. These vents can be three to 16 feet wide, among the largest ever found on the planet.
On Pemiscot Bayou in Arkansas, 60 miles south of New Madrid, Tuttle has found sand blows that buried huge trees. Broken trunks still stand, tilted and well preserved, amid the fine sediment that entombed them as the surrounding land slumped. Such slumping formed entire lakes in several places, including today's Reelfoot Lake in Tennessee and Big Lake, Ark.
The size of the sand blows indicates especially powerful earthquakes in 1811-12, Tuttle says. "I have seen the geological record of these events, and I can attest that the ground was basically ripped apart."
Further evidence for the earthquakes' ferocity, Tuttle notes, is that sand blows can be found up and down the Mississippi River Valley from Illinois to Arkansas. Sand blows across a similarly vast area appeared during the 2001 earthquake in Bhuj, India, which killed 20,000 and was recorded at magnitude 7.7. Like New Madrid, this temblor happened mid-continent in a locale not severely shaken since 1819.

More to come?
As she works with archaeologists in probing sand blows, Tuttle finds arrowheads and even whole Indian mounds on top of some of them. Radiocarbon dating of buried leaves and twigs confirms that these blows are much older than 200 years, suggesting that New Madrid-size earthquakes have happened in this region repeatedly. In fact, Tuttle and her associates have documented that the valley rocked to monster quakes around the years 300, 900 and 1450 as well as 2350 B.C. The 1811-12 event was one in a series, which could point ominously to the future.
One of Tuttle's colleagues, Haydar Al-Shukri at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, had a hunch that similar, prehistoric earthquakes might have struck 50 miles south of the New Madrid seismic zone, in an area long thought to be geologically quiet. In the cotton fields of the Arkansas Delta he has recently found huge patches of gleaming white sand, cursed by farmers but invaluable as scientific evidence.
The largest of these covers 29 acres, so sprawling that Al-Shukri nicknamed it Daytona Beach.
Using a new dating technique called optically stimulated luminescence, Al-Shukri can tell how long it has been since samples of soil have been touched by sunlight. Daytona Beach formed about 3500 B.C., presumably the result of a magnitude 7.0 quake (about the strength of Haiti's 2010 disaster) or stronger. His findings prove that such events can happen in places well outside the known seismic zones and that periods of violent activity may be followed by thousands of years of torpor.
This poses a conundrum for emergency management experts: How to plan for earthquakes if  seismic activity wanders around the map?
To add to the confusion, Northwestern University geophysicist Seth Stein arguesthat there won't be any future earthquakes at New Madrid. He has gathered GPS data that show no pressure developing in the Earth's surface there; hence, he argues, no energy is building for a convulsion. He believes mid-continent seismicity moves around, so that as the New Madrid zone "turns off," future quakes may happen elsewhere. 
Others, though, say Stein puts too much weight on GPS data. Strain may be building deep inside the Earth, where GPS cannot peer. And GPS data have been gathered for only a few years. The U.S. Geological Survey continues to warn of the potentialfor "a major destructive earthquake" from Memphis north to southern Illinois, relying in large measure on the sand-blow evidence.
"Based on this history of past earthquakes, the USGS estimates the chance of having an earthquake similar to one of the 1811-12 sequence in the next 50 years is about 7 to 10 percent, and the chance of having a magnitude 6 or larger earthquake in 50 years is 25 to 40 percent," a fact sheet says.
Most scientists seem to agree. "My goal is not to scare people," Al-Shukri says. "I'm not saying it will come tomorrow. But it might come."

For D.C. film industry, a Capitol hassle

BYLINE: Steve Hendrix

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A01

LENGTH: 1332 words

John Latenser doesn't want to lose his dome.
The Bethesda-based location scout was standing last week on one of Hollywood's favorite spots in the District, a sliver of pavement at the edge of the reflecting pool with the U.S. Capitol looming just so over his shoulder - as it has loomed over Sean Penn, Aaron Eckhart and various Transformer robots.
"This is one of the great money shots in D.C.," says Latenser, who was here scouting angles for "Veep," a new HBO series that hopes to add Julia Louis-Dreyfus to the list of those filmed at this spot off of First Street NW.
Directors love this angle not so much for aesthetic reasons as legal ones. It is as close as they are allowed to get to the Capitol itself. So Latenser and others in the D.C. film community were horrified to learn last month that Congress had quietly lifted control over this easternmost patch of the Mall from the U.S. Park Service, which is known as a film-friendly agency, and given it to the Capitol Police, which is not. 
"The answer from the Capitol is always absolutely no," Peggy Pridemore, another D.C. location manager, whose local credits include "Wedding Crashers," "Night at the Museum 2" and "Forrest Gump." "My entire industry was afraid we are going to lose that special spot to film the Capitol building."
The prospect of giving up their beauty shot of the D.C. icon comes at a bad time for the city's film industry. Even as Washington story lines are enjoying a boom in movies and television, the nation's capital is losing more and more of the actual location work to other cities.
No matter how much art directors crave Washington's majestic vistas, they quickly run into twin deal-killers: Filming in the security-obsessed federal core has become a hair-pulling hassle, and the District government lacks the money to compete with sweetheart  incentives from other locations.
Baltimore, in particular, is eating the District's popcorn. Thanks to Maryland's generous tax-deferral program for film projects and aggressive courting of producers, at least three recent Washington-set stories are using Charm City as a stand-in. They include "Veep"; "Game Change," a coming Sara Palin flick from HBO; and "House of Cards," a political drama that will mark Netflix's first foray into original programming.
"It's heartbreaking," said Crystal Palmer, director of the District's Office of Motion Picture and Television Development, of the spate of other locations doubling for the District. "We have a two-fold problem. The first question they ask is 'Do you have an incentive program?' The second is 'Can I film inside the U.S. Capitol?' We basically have to say no to both.' "
Seeing Baltimore's Tremont Plaza Hotel stand in for Senate offices, as it does in "Veep," is more than an annoyance for District officials. A feature-film crew can spend up to $500,000 a day on location. In all, the D.C. government estimates that the commercial filming it did attract brought $20.5 million into the city last year. "I think we could have doubled our business easily," Palmer said, if so many productions weren't outsourced to other locations.
Patrick Burn, a District-based location manager, described a single sequence in the 2010 thriller "Salt," in which Angelina Jolie is seen jumping from a bridge at L'Enfant Plaza. The shot, which amounted to two seconds of screen time, cost nearly $70,000 in local truck and crew expenses.
"People think of film crews as a bunch of people standing around with cappuccinos in their hands," said location manager Joseph Martin, who is managing "House of Cards." "But there's a whole blue-collar element. These are jobs."
The District made a pitch for all of the recent projects, Palmer said, but is facing ever-stiffer competition. Maryland, for example, last year bumped its annual film incentive budget from $1 million to $7.5 million annually. Palmer and D.C. Mayor Vincent C. Gray (D) met with the producers of "House of Cards" last year in Los Angeles, where they learned that Maryland had offered up to $11.5 million in multi-year incentives. The producers said they would come to D.C. if the city could come up with at least $3.5 million in tax deferrals. After two weeks of scrounging the budget, Palmer had to call back empty-handed.
"The game changed," Palmer said. "The film business used to be location, location. Now it's money, money, money."
But even if the District could find more money, filming amid the monuments and marble has become complex in ways that would have been inconceivable in the days when Frank Capra could use the halls of Congress to portray the halls of Congress in "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington."
"I know of one spot where the street is D.C., the sidewalk is National Park Service and when you walk toward the building you've got Federal Protective Services," said Latenser, who has worked on dozens of local crews, including "Transformers," "24," "National Treasure" and "Thank You for Smoking." "I can safely say this is the most difficult city to shoot in in America."
Increasingly, producers come here to shoot drive-by footage of the Washington Monument, the Lincoln Memorial and other signature settings and then insert their characters digitally. NBC's "The West Wing" was largely filmed on California sound stages, with actors visiting Washington occasionally for outside establishing shots in makeshift settings.
"A lot of people have used this area to stand in for the White House portico," said Peggy Martz, showing off a columned corner of the Daughters of the American Revolution headquarters on 17th Street NW. The light fixtures in a nearby hallway are left over from a "West Wing" shoot, the draperies from "Salt." "They're nicer than what we had, so they said we could keep them," said Martz.
The "Veep" crew came briefly to shoot some motorcade sequences, driving their cameras up Massachusetts Avenue behind a D.C. police escort. That sequence will be dropped between scenes in the vice president's office (played by a sound stage in Columbia) and the Veep's Naval Observatory mansion (a house in Baltimore County).
Director Stephen Soderberg adopted guerilla tactics to film his  HBO series "K Street" in the District, driving around with a camera and actors to shoot impromptu scenes around the city.
"We could fit the entire crew into two 14-passenger vans, including George Clooney, James Carville and Mary Matalin," said Martin, whose work has included "Minority Report" and "The Insider."
One "K Street" scene was shot near the reflecting pool spot that was just annexed as U.S. Capitol property. The transfer, apparently made at the request of Capitol officials in order to beef up security around the 11-acre parcel known as Union Square, was slipped into the December appropriations bill without a hearing.
The spot instantly became off-limits to commercial filming in accordance with the long-standing policy on all other Capitol grounds. Filmmakers quickly contacted Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), who pressured Hill officials not to cut off one of Hollywood's favorite close-ups of American government.
"For goodness' sake, let us have a film industry to provide revenue for our city," said Holmes-Norton last week.
Senate Sergeant at Arms Terrance W. Gainer said Congress is working to carve out a Union Square exception to the no-filming rule. He has instructed Capitol Police to follow Park Service policy in granting permits for the next 90 days, by which time he hopes Congress will pass a law making it permanently permissible to shoot from the spot.
"Our primary concern is security," said Gainer. "We had no desire to pick a fight with anybody about shooting movies, and we're not trying to put anybody out of work." 
But Gainer said movie makers shouldn't expect to get any closer to that dome. That's too bad, say those who like to see Washington movies made in Washington.
"These iconic monuments are a terrific incentive for them to film here," said Holmes-Norton. "If we can just get permission."

Brandon Paul shook off a poor-shooting game to score 18 points, including two free throws with 45 seconds left that gave Illinois the lead in a 42-41 victory over No. 9 Michigan State on Tuesday night in Champaign, Ill.
Paul had two chances to extend the lead for the Illini (16-6, 5-4 Big Ten) but he missed two free throws in the final 30 seconds. 
Michigan State's Derrick Nix had a chance to tie the score at 42 with 14 seconds left but he made 1 of 2 free throws. Keith Appling missed a driving shot with two seconds left, the final chance for the Spartans (17-5, 6-3), who shot 24 percent (14 of 58).
After spending much of the game on the bench in foul trouble, Michigan State's Draymond Green left with just under four minutes to play with what appeared to be an injury to his left knee. He had to be helped off the court. Spartans Coach Tom Izzo wasn't sure immediately after the game how seriously Green was injured.
He is the Spartans' leading scorer and rebounder but finished with just five points and eight rebounds in 16 minutes.
"I didn't think we handled adversity very well at all," Izzo said. "My two best players had their worst games."
lKENTUCKY 69, TENNESSEE 44: Freshman Anthony Davis had 18 points, eight rebounds and seven blocked shots as the top-ranked Wildcats extended their home winning streak to 48 games.
Kentucky (22-1, 8-0 Southeastern Conference) won its 14th straight game overall. The Volunteers (10-12, 2-5) were led by Renaldo Woolridge, who tied his career high with 17 points.
lNORTH CAROLINA 68, WAKE FOREST 53: In Winston-Salem, N.C., Tyler Zeller had 18 points and a career-best 18 rebounds to help the No. 5 Tar Heels (19-3, 6-1 ACC) win their fourth straight despite shooting 31 percent. C.J. Harris scored 19 points to lead the Demon Deacons (11-11, 2-6).
lMARQUETTE 66, SETON HALL 59: In Milwaukee, Jae Crowder had 20 points and 12 rebounds, helping the No. 15 Golden Eagles (19-4, 8-2 Big East) win its seventh straight. Herb Pope scored 16 points for the Pirates (15-7, 4-6), who have lost five straight.
lWISCONSIN 52, PENN ST. 46: Jordan Taylor scored 18 points to help the No. 19 Badgers (18-5, 7-3 Big Ten) win their sixth in a row. Tim Frazier led the host Lions (10-13, 2-8) with 21 points.
lARKANSAS 82, VANDERBILT 74: Ricky Scott scored 18 points and the Razorbacks (16-6, 4-3 SEC) made nine three-pointers in improving to 16-0 at home this season. The 25th-ranked Commodores are 16-6, 5-2.

Notre Dame women roll
Skylar Diggins scored 18 points and Natalie Achonwa added 15 to help No. 2 Notre Dame beat 13th-ranked Rutgers, 71-41, in Piscataway, N.J., for the Irish's 19th straight victory. It's the third-longest winning streak ever for Notre Dame (22-1, 9-0 Big East). Monique Oliver scored 17 points to lead the Scarlet Knights (17-5, 6-3).

ATF office blamed for Fast and Furious

BYLINE: Sari Horwitz

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A03

LENGTH: 824 words

Federal agents based in Phoenix, not officials at Justice Department headquarters in Washington, were responsible for the controversial tactics used in the gun operation known as "Fast and Furious," Democrats on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee said in a report released Tuesday.
A year after it became known that the operation relied on a tactic known as gun walking, the 89-page report called Fast and Furious "reckless and fatally flawed." It puts the blame squarely on the Phoenix office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. It also concludes that the strategy began as early as 2006. 
"Contrary to repeated claims by some, the Committee has obtained no evidence that Operation Fast and Furious was a politically-motivated operation conceived and directed by high-level Obama Administration political appointees at the Department of Justice," Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) wrote in a letter to committee members. 
Separately, committee chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) on Tuesday threatened to hold Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. in contempt of Congress if he does not turn over documents by Feb. 9. Issa accused Holder's department of being "actively engaged in a cover-up."
Republican lawmakers say the department has turned over 80,000 documents to its inspector general, but just 6,000 documents to the committee. In response, a Justice Department official said the department has worked with the committee by providing numerous witnesses and thousands of documents, adding that "we will continue to do so."
Holder is scheduled to testify before the committee Thursday. At the last hearing, Issa and other Republicans on the committeehttp://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/darrell-issa-not-joining-calls-for-eric-holder-to-quit-over-fast-and-furious/2011/12/02/gIQAHsSSMO_story.html grilled Holder about Fast and Furious, in which federal agents targeting a drug cartel allowed more than 2,000 guns to flow illegally onto U.S. streets and into Mexico between 2009 and January 2011. Two of the guns connected to the operation were found at a crime scene near Nogales, Ariz., where U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent Brian Terry was slain in December 2010.
Fast and Furious has led to a storm of criticism in the past year from congressional Republicans, many of whom have urged Holder to resign.
The report, called "Fatally Flawed: Five Years of Gunwalking in Arizona," found that ATF's Phoenix Field Division launched four "reckless operations" between 2006 and 2010 under both the Obama and George W. Bush administrations and failed to end them even after the flaws became evident.
"Operation Fast and Furious was the fourth in a series of operations in which gunwalking - the non-interdiction of illegally purchased firearms that could and should be seized by law enforcement - occurred since 2006," Cummings wrote.
The Phoenix division ran "Operation Wide Receiver" out of Tucson in 2006 and '07, and another 2007 operation called "The Hernandez Case." The report also details a 2008 operation called "The Medrano Case," in which ATF agents knew that a man named Alejandro Medrano and his associates were making illegal firearms purchases and trafficking the weapons into Mexico. During that summer, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents raised concerns about the tactics, but the operations continued for several more months.
The Medrano case was detailed in a Washington Post series on guns in 2010. But ATF, which promoted the case as a successful gun prosecution, did not reveal in interviews with The Post that federal agents had watched suspects cross the border with guns.
"This report tells the story of how misguided gunwalking operations originated in 2006 as ATF's Phoenix Field Division devised a strategy to forgo prosecutions against low-level straw purchasers while they attempted to build bigger charges," Cummings said.
The report also describes the complaints by ATF and agents and officials who said that  the situation in Phoenix was compounded by the Arizona U.S. Attorney's Office, which failed to aggressively prosecute firearms trafficking cases, and the federal courts in Arizona, "which showed leniency toward the trafficking networks that fuel armed violence in Mexico."   
The two Republicans who have led the investigation into Fast and Furious dismissed the findings of the report, with one labeling it a "knee-jerk defense" from Democrats in Congress.
"The idea that senior political appointees have clean hands in these gun-walking scandals doesn't pass the laugh test," said Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa). "The American people want to see those who failed to act be held accountable."
Issa called the report's conclusions a "flawed view that the Justice Department should be given the full benefit of the doubt despite a lengthy record of false statements, misdirection and a continued refusal to turn over subpoenaed evidence."

American diplomat in Moscow handled Oswald's attempted defection in 1959

BYLINE: T. Rees Shapiro

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B07

LENGTH: 658 words

Richard E. Snyder, a Foreign Service officer who as a senior consul in Moscow handled the attempted defection of future presidential assassin Lee Harvey Oswald to the Soviet Union, died Jan. 9 at a health-care facility in Georgetown, Ky. He was 92.
He had Alzheimer's disease, said his daughter Dianne Snyder. 
Mr. Snyder served as a Japanese and Russian specialist in the State Department from 1950 to 1970. He spent the much of his career serving in posts across Japan, and he helped prepare for the 1972 transfer of the Ryukyu Islands from the United States back to Japan.
But it was his two years in Russia during the height of Cold War tensions that proved the most eventful.
From July 1959 to July 1961, Mr. Snyder served as a senior consular official at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. During that time, he attended the trial of Francis Gary Powers, an American spy-plane pilot who was shot down in 1960 over the Ural mountains.
In 1979, Mr. Snyder wrote an expansive account published in The Washington Post of his encounters with Oswald.
It was on a Saturday - Oct. 31, 1959 - that Mr. Snyder was approached by Oswald, a slim and primly groomed man who announced his desire to dissolve his American citizenship. He had recently separated from the U.S. Marine Corps and had traveled to the Soviet Union inspired by his professed belief in Marxism.
When he came to Mr. Snyder's desk that day in October, Oswald thrust his U.S. passport into the consul's hands.
Mr. Snyder inspected Oswald's papers and found that he'd just had his 20th birthday. During his tenure in Moscow, Mr. Snyder had dealt with such defection cases before.
"Among the humanitarian and political considerations in such cases was the naivete of the principals," Mr. Snyder wrote in The Post. "A common characteristic of those who chose the Soviet Union as the place to work out their problems was that they knew nothing about it."
Although Oswald seemed adamant about becoming a Soviet citizen, Mr. Snyder told the young man to think about his decision and return the following Monday to sign the appropriate documents. In the meantime, Mr. Snyder stowed Oswald's passport in his embassy desk for safekeeping.
Oswald did not come back for 20 months. During that time, he worked in a factory in Minsk.
When Oswald returned to the U.S. Embassy in July 1961, he told Mr. Snyder that he had "learned a hard lesson the hard way."
As one of his last duties in Russia, Mr. Snyder agreed to return Oswald his passport. Days later, Mr. Snyder left Moscow for another assignment in Tokyo.
Mr. Snyder later wrote that Oswald had been "relegated to a forgotten corner of my mind" until President John F. Kennedy was fatally shot in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963. Oswald was shot and killed two days later by nightclub owner Jack Ruby.
Oswald was the principal suspect in the presidential assassination, and Mr. Snyder later testified for the Warren Commission about his handling of Oswald in Moscow.
"Why, an acquaintance once asked me, did we let a guy like Oswald back into the country?" Mr. Snyder wrote in 1979. "The answer is that an American doesn't need permission to return to his own country. Unlike some, the American state has no power to banish those it thinks unworthy."
Richard Edward Snyder was born Dec. 10, 1919, in Newark. During World War II, he served in the Army in Europe and received the Bronze Star Medal for helping to evacuate his wounded comrades while under enemy fire. He spent 10 years in the Army Reserve and retired at the rank of major.
He was a 1948 Yale University graduate and received a master's degree in Russian studies from Harvard University in 1956.
Mr. Snyder lived in Alexandria for more than 30 years before moving to Kentucky in 2004.
His wife of 64 years, Anna Dimeo Snyder, died in 2006.
Survivors include two daughters, Dianne Snyder of Alexandria and Gail Wiederwohl of Georgetown, Ky.; a brother; three grandchildren; and two great-granddaughters.

Booker seizes opportunity

BYLINE: Michael Lee

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. D02

LENGTH: 548 words

Washington Wizards forward Trevor Booker has gained an opportunity now that Andray Blatche is expected to miss the next three to five weeks with a strained left calf muscle.
Blatche, the Wizards' fifth-leading scorer, was injured shortly after entering Saturday's game in Charlotte and Booker quickly took advantage, scoring 16 points in just 19 minutes while helping the Wizards (4-17) get their first road win of the season. Booker scored 14 points on 7-of-9 shooting, and grabbed a team-high nine rebounds, in the Wizards' 98-88 loss on Monday to Chicago.
"Unfortunately, Dray got hurt in the Charlotte game," Booker said. "Somebody got to step up and I just tried to go in and fill his role as best as I could and take the shots that was coming to me and keep playing hard on defense." 
Booker has had an odd second season in Washington. He missed part of training camp, still recovering from a bruised left thighinjury suffered while playing in Israel during the lockout. He then got patchy minutes before replacing Blatche in the starting lineup for five games. He went back to the bench, never knowing when he would get his chance. And when Blatche went down against the Bobcats, Booker wasn't sure how he would be utilized going forward.
Coach Randy Wittman plans to lean on him more, especially since the 6-foot-7 Booker gives the Wizards versatility on both ends of the floor. "If he plays with that energy - that's what he has to do," Wittman said. "That's a facet at that position that can really cause problems at the power forward position. He's as quick and strong as anybody he's going to play against, and he's got to use those things to his advantage. I have to do a better job of utilizing those talents, whether it be defensively, but he fits into running for us, obviously, from the offensive standpoint."
Booker has always been one of the Wizards' better defenders and a high-energy player, but when he arrived in Israel, his team, B'nai Hasharon, wanted to make him more of a focal point on offense. It was an unusual position for him, but he developed enough confidence to where he showed off an improved low-post game against the Bulls, scoring with his back to the basket.
"It was a different experience," Booker said of playing overseas. "Me being over there, because I was the main player. They wanted me to be the main scorer and I wasn't used to that from last year. But I think it helped me some this year. I wasn't comfortable taking those shots last year. I've been working so I feel more comfortable taking it."
Booker will always be undersized, but he will never use it as an excuse when he has to contend with taller players every night. "That's why you have to play with heart," Booker said. "In college I played in the ACC, played against players that were always taller than me so I was pretty much used to it coming here."
Veteran Rashard Lewis is confident that Booker will be able to help the Wizards fill the void in Blatche's absence. "Trevor's been playing well. He plays well, he rebounds, he defends," he said. "He does all the little things. He does the dirty work to help us win ball games. I have no problem with Trevor being in there at all. I know he's going to go out and play hard and he's going to play the game the right way."

Acquaintance is charged in Alexandria activist's death

BYLINE: Matt Zapotosky

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A01

LENGTH: 706 words

Prince George's County homicide detectives charged an Oxon Hill man Tuesday in the slaying of Alexandria activist Lenny Harris - taking  an important step, they hope, toward  unraveling the mystery that began when Harris suddenly vanished in September only to turn up dead at the bottom of a well in Fort Washington last week.
Linwood Johnson, 49, was charged with first-degree murder and is being held in the Prince George's County jail, authorities said. Assistant Police Chief Kevin Davis said that Johnson and Harris "were known to each other" and that Johnson did not act alone. Detectives think that Harris's attackers set out to rob him, Davis said. 
Beyond that, police said little. Davis said that detectives expect to make more arrests soon, and he did not specify Johnson's alleged role in the crime or his connection to Harris. He said Harris was shot at the long-vacant, secluded property where his body was found in a well Thursday, but he offered nothing in the way of a timeline of events from Sept. 21, when Harris went missing.
The arrest marks a significant break in a difficult case that has vexed investigators in two states for months. Harris had been a longtime fixture at Alexandria community meetings and city recreation centers and was well known in the community.
"Our work is far from done," Davis said. "We're certainly hopeful. Our leads are very, very strong."
The night of Sept. 21, Harris met with a friend at the Charles Houston Recreation Center in Alexandria. He never made it home to his wife.
Long before his body was recovered, detectives suspected foul play. A tattooed man was recorded by an ATM surveillance camera as he used Harris's bank card hours after Harris disappeared, and police found Harris's cellphone on the Woodrow Wilson Bridge.
Police distributed the photos of the tattooed man, hoping for a clue that would lead to Harris, but weeks, and months, passed.
Then, last week, an anonymous caller dialed 911 and directed police to a well in the 11900 block of Old Fort Road in Fort Washington. Detectives are still trying to identify the caller. The property had been vacant since 1996, leading investigators to believe that whoever put the body in the well knew the area.
On Saturday, after a days-long excavation process, Harris's remains were pulled above ground and sent to Baltimore for an autopsy. A medical examiner determined that he had been shot.
Harris, who lived with his wife in Del Ray, was known in Alexandria for speaking out for the underprivileged. He made an unsuccessful run for the council in 2007 and was co-founder of the nonprofit group Operation Hope, which offers mentoring and career-development services. He also ran a pest-control business. After his disappearance, hundreds gathered for a candlelight vigil.
Alexandria Mayor William D. Euille (D), who knew Harris for more than 30 years, said he was relieved that police had made an arrest in the killing.
"He was a very dedicated, concerned individual who was a great mentor for our youth and young adults," Euille said. "He was a strong advocate for the folks who are less-fortunate. He will be missed, and hopefully his legacy will be carried on by others."
Davis, the assistant police chief, said Tuesday that Alexandria detectives had put together a strong case before Prince George's homicide investigators became involved, and that work helped lead police to Johnson. He said that Johnson provided a "full written and verbal confession" to his involvement in the slaying and that detectives had recovered the gun they believe was used to shoot Harris.
Online court records show that Johnson was convicted in a 1988 robbery case. In recent years, the records show, he has been charged with mostly minor offenses - some of which have been dropped. In Prince George's, he is currently charged with selling counterfeit DVDs outside a Temple Hills gas station. He told officers that he was selling the DVDs, for $5 each, to "try and make a little money," according to police charging documents.
Efforts to reach Johnson's and Harris's family members were unsuccessful.

No bond for suspect in activist's death

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B05

LENGTH: 215 words

The man charged with killing an Alexandria activist was ordered held without bond Wednesday, as Prince George's County homicide detectives continued their search for other suspects, authorities said. 
Linwood Johnson, 49, is charged with the first-degree murder of Lenny Harris, 53, whose remains were pulled from a well in Fort Washington late last week. Harris, who lived with his wife in Del Ray, was known in Alexandria for speaking out for the underprivileged, and he made an unsuccessful run for the City Council in 2007.
Detectives are working to unravel the mystery that began when Harris vanished in September. http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/man-charged-in-va-activist-lenny-harriss-death/2012/01/31/gIQAZlKMgQ_story.htmlThey have determined that Harris was fatally shot before he was dumped in the well on a vacant property in the 11900 block of Old Fort Road and that those who attacked him had set out to rob him. It remains unclear, however, why he was targeted and what Johnson's alleged role in the crime was. Police have said the men were "known to each other."
Efforts to reach Johnson's family Wednesday were unsuccessful, and a spokeswoman for the Prince George's State's Attorney Office said no one came to speak on his behalf at a bond hearing.

America's soul proprietor

BYLINE: Matt Schudel

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A01

LENGTH: 1061 words

Don Cornelius, creator and host of "Soul Train," a milestone in television programming that introduced generations of viewers to new music and dance trends emerging from black America, died Feb. 1 of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in Los Angeles, according to police. He was 75.
Police responded to a report of a shooting at Mr. Cornelius's house about 4 a.m., and he was pronounced dead at a hospital. Police ruled out foul play in the death and said a search of the house did not turn up a suicide note. Detectives were conducting interviews to learn more about Mr. Cornelius's mental state.
 "Soul Train," which aired for more than 35 years, was the longest first-run syndicated television series in broadcast history. In addition to its cultural importance, with regular appearances by such musical giants as Michael Jackson, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmMEoXfzRw4James Brownand Aretha Franklin, the show represented a major advance for showcasing black music in popular culture. 
Recognizing that the major TV networks had virtually no programs geared toward black audiences in 1970, Mr. Cornelius designed "Soul Train" as what he called "a black 'American Bandstand.' "  
As the show's host, he promised - in a burnished baritone voice - to take viewers on "the hippest trip in America." He drew dozens of star headliners to "Soul Train," but Mr. Cornelius's greater achievement might have been as a behind-the-scenes producer and businessman who helped persuade mainstream companies to spend advertising dollars on largely black audiences. 
"Most of what we get credit for is people saying, 'I learned how to dance from watching  "Soul Train" back in the day,' " Mr. Cornelius told Vibe magazine in 2006. "But what I take credit for is that there were no black television commercials to speak of before 'Soul Train.' There were few black faces in those ads before 'Soul Train.' And what I am most proud of is that we made television history."
Mr. Cornelius later launched a record company and a series of awards shows and was recognized, along with Quincy Jones and Berry Gordy, as one of the most influential African Americans in the music business. Younger entertainment entrepreneurs including Debra Lee, chairman and chief executive of Black Entertainment Television, and performer-producer Russell Simmons credited him as a major influence on their careers.
"Soul Train" first aired in Mr. Cornelius's hometown of Chicago in 1970, then moved to Los Angeles a year later, when it was syndicated nationally. 
Viewers were initially attracted by the hit songs of top performers, but the infectious dancing of teenagers at the show's studio kept drawing them back. Young people of all races looked to "Soul Train" each week as a monitor of cultural currency. 
"It was extremely influential," Ron Simon, curator for radio and television at the Paley Center for Media in New York, said in an interview. "It opened up a window on African American culture, not only its music but fashion and dance, in homes all across America."
By the 1990s, with musical tastes changing from rhythm-and-blues to the blunter approach of spoken-word hip-hop, Mr. Cornelius found himself falling behind the times.  In one tune, rapper Ice Cube said in 1990, " 'Soul Train' done lost they soul."
Mr. Cornelius retired as the show's regular host in 1993, but "Soul Train" remained in production another 13 years. "The audience was changing, and I wasn't," he said.
Donald Cortez Cornelius was born in Chicago on Sept. 27, 1936. He served in the Marine Corps in the 1950s, then sold insurance before going to broadcasting school in 1966.
"People always talked about my voice," he once told Billboard magazine, "so I took a broadcasting course as a lark."
He began working at a black-oriented radio station in Chicago, then moved to a small television station. In 1969, he came up with the name "Soul Train" when he staged a series of dance shows at four Chicago high schools in a single day.
A year later, his TV station allowed him to make a "Soul Train" pilot if he would pay all the expenses himself. Mr. Cornelius brought in teenage dancers to perform to the music of Jerry Butler, the Chi-Lites and the Emotions, and his new show immediately became a hit with black audiences.
"Overnight, everyone in Chicago knew who I was," Mr. Cornelius told The Washington Post in 1995. "The show was the talk of the town."
He modeled "Soul Train" after Dick Clark's "American Bandstand," and in many markets the two shows competed head to head on Saturday mornings. Clark launched a  short-lived rival show, "Soul Unlimited," in the 1970s and tried to lure away some of Mr. Cornelius's spirited dancers. "Bandstand" ceased production in 1989. 
In the days before MTV, "Soul Train" became a favored destination for such renowned artists as Marvin Gaye, the Jackson 5, Al Green, Ike and Tina Turner, Diana Ross, Elton John, David Bowie and Earth Wind & Fire, who lip-synched their hits before the audience. Occasionally, however, there were memorable live performances from Barry White, James Brown, Aretha Franklin and others. 
Mr. Cornelius interviewed the performers and introduced their songs, often using one of his signature lines: "You can bet your last money, it's gonna be a stone gas, honey!"
The young dancers of the "Soul Train Line" provided much of the show's enthusiasm, and several of them became stars in their own right, including Grammy Award-winning singer Jody Watley, hip-hop performer MC Hammer, and actresses Rosie Perez and Carmen Electra.
Mr. Cornelius had a record company in the 1970s, and in 1987 he inaugurated the Soul Train Music Awards. 
After "Soul Train" left the air in 2006, Mr. Cornelius became increasingly reclusive. In 2009, after his wife, model Viktoria Chapman-Cornelius, had filed two restraining orders against him, he pleaded guilty to spousal abuse. At the time of their divorce in 2009, Mr. Cornelius said he had "significant health issues."
An earlier marriage, to Delores Harrison, also ended in divorce. They had two sons. A complete list of survivors could not be obtained. 
Long after Mr. Cornelius had retired as host of "Soul Train," the show remained a cultural touchstone. Many viewers still recall the sign-off line that ended each week's episode: "I'm Don Cornelius, and as always in parting, we wish you love, peace and . . . soul."

Roadwork planned near Howard theater
The Howard Theatre, a landmark in Shaw that launched the career of Marvin Gaye and others, is undergoing a renovation, and the surrounding area is also getting a facelift.
The District Department of Transportation is reconstructing the roads around the theater in Northwest Washington. This includes work on T Street from Seventh Street to Florida Avenue and on Wiltberger Street between T and S streets. 
T Street will be closed between Seventh Street and Florida Avenue during the construction. 
This will allow for resurfacing of Seventh Street and T Street and the development of Ellington Plaza. A detour will be put in place, and traffic will be limited to local residents and businesses.
Work will also occur in the alley west of Wiltberger Street between T and S streets and in the alley between Florida Avenue and T Street.
The work is scheduled Monday through Saturday between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. Signs will be posted 72 hours before any sidewalks, roads or alley entrances will be closed, DDOT said.

Judge defers decision on Hopkins lawsuit
Lawyers for Johns Hopkins University appeared in a Montgomery County courtroom Wednesday and asked a judge to dismiss a lawsuit by the family of Elizabeth Beall Banks over the future of Belward Farm, a 108-acre property that is a key component of the county's effort to cement its reputation as a hub for biotech research.
Judge Katherine D. Savage declined to make an immediate ruling after the hearing but indicated that she would decide "as soon as possible."
Banks's heirs filed a lawsuit to block the project in November. They say the university's plans to build a 4.7-million-square-foot research and development campus on the property violate the terms of a 1989 deal Johns Hopkins officials signed with their aunt. Banks was well known throughout the county for her opposition to large-scale development. Her family says university officials said they would build a satellite university campus on the property.
Hopkins officials say that nothing in the deed or contract states that they must build a satellite campus and that the deed doesn't limit the size of what is ultimately built on the property.

Sturgeon colonies in peril, agency warns
Atlantic sturgeon, one of the most imperiled fish in the world, made it onto the endangered species list Wednesday.
Once plentiful, sturgeon in the United States  and worldwide have plummeted in number since humans targeted them for their caviar.  
Officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries Service listed the New York Bight, Chesapeake Bay, Carolina and South Atlantic populations as endangered, and the Gulf of Maine population as threatened. The move could lead to new protections for the fish's habitat along the East Coast. http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/decline-of-predators-such-as-wolves-throws-food-chains-out-of-whack-report-says/2011/07/14/gIQAaeY1EI_story.html

'Right to work' bill  becomes law
Indiana on Wednesday became the 23rd U.S. state to pass "right to work" legislation and the first in the nation's manufacturing heartland, dealing a blow to labor by allowing workers to opt out of paying union dues.
Indiana's Republican governor, Mitch Daniels, signed the legislation into law after it was approved, in a vote of 28to 22, by the state Senate, making Indiana the first state to adopt such a measure since Oklahoma did so a decade ago.
Opponents say the measure will weaken unions and lower workers' wages. The vote drew thousands of protesters to the state capital in Indianapolis.
Daniels said he decided Indiana needed the new law after several businesses moved out of the state.

According to Sandia engineers, the bullet twists and turns to guide itself toward a laser- directed point. It can make up to thirty corrections per second while in the air, officials said.
Sandia Labs said potential customers for the bullet could include the military, law enforcement and recreational shooters.

Sikh man held onrare charge is freed
A Sikh man who had spent more than a year in jail in Kabul on the unusual charge of falsely claiming Afghan citizenship was freed Wednesday, a day after a Washington Post article detailed his plight.
Baljit Singh, 23, and his attorney, Kimberley Motley, said the article about the case had prompted Afghan authorities to release him. "This feeling," an elated Singh said, "I can't explain it to you."
Singh, who says he was born in Afghanistan and left as a child, was imprisoned after Britain deported him in summer 2010. He says fellow inmatesand guards taunted and beathim for being a Sikh. Sikhsrepresent a vanishing religious minority in Afghanistan, adeeply conservative Muslim country. 
Motley said Wednesday that Afghan officials have given her client documents that allow him to travel around the country but have not conceded that he is an Afghan citizen.
Because he has no relativesin Afghanistan, Singh is temporarily staying with Motley. Their goal is to find a country willing to admit him as arefugee.

Troops, defectorsfight near Damascus
Syrian troops battled army defectors in a string of towns in the mountains overlooking Damascus on Wednesday in an apparent new effort to crush rebellious areas around the capital, activists said.
The battles came after government forces succeeded in largely retaking control of suburbs on the eastern side of the city in the past week. More than 30 people were killed around the country Wednesday, activists said.
Shelling and machine-gun fire rattled in towns along the Wadi Barada, a valley in the mountains a few miles northwest of Damascus, according to online video posted by activists.
The valley leads to the mountain resort town of Zabadani, an opposition stronghold that has been under the control of rebel soldiers and protesters for several weeks.

Afghan challenge contrasted with Iraq

BYLINE: Greg Jaffe;Kevin Sieff

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A01

LENGTH: 1209 words

The narrative that the Obama administration has laid out for winding down the war in Afghanistan has a familiar feel: It is intended to evoke the gradual withdrawal from Iraq.
But the administration faces a fundamentally different challenge in Afghanistan and a host of problems that it did not have in the latter days of the Iraq war.
In Afghanistan, heavy fighting is likely to persist well into 2014, particularly in the provinces along Pakistan's border, senior military officials said. In contrast with Iraq, the Afghan government and security forces will require billions of dollars annually in U.S. support  indefinitely. It seems unlikely that the insurgents' haven in Pakistan will shrink.
"In Afghanistan, you will be fighting a much tougher war over the next few years compared with Iraq post-2008," said retired Lt. Gen. David Barno, who previously served as the top U.S. commander in Kabul. 
Obama administration officials made the comparison to Iraq on Thursday as they scrambled to clarify Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta's remarks http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/us-nato-seek-to-clarify-panetta-comments-on-ending-afghan-combat-mission/2012/02/02/gIQANEujkQ_story.html?hpid=z3that the United States hoped to end its combat mission in Afghanistan by the middle of next year, more than a year earlier than scheduled, and shift to advising Afghan forces.
"Iraq is a helpful reference point in this," said White House spokesman Jay Carney. Just as in Iraq, he said, American advisers would remain in the country and would "continue to participate in combat missions."
But by mid-2010, when the Obama administration declared an end to the U.S. combat mission in Iraq, American forces had already pulled out of the country's major cities, where the war's fiercest and bloodiest battles took place. The 49,000 U.S. advisory troops that remained took casualties, but the vast majority of the fighting was carried out by Iraqi forces.
In Afghanistan, Taliban forces still control swaths of territory in the mountainous eastern regions along the border, where they continue to kill Afghan government forces and intimidate villagers.
"Are we ready to take over? In some places, we are," said one Afghan commander, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "But in others, we aren't now, and we won't be in a year."
The Afghan commander's concerns were echoed by senior U.S. military officials in Kabul who insisted that Panetta's remarks did not signal a change in U.S. policy or even a planned diminution in combat operations for U.S. forces.
In many ways, the dust-up caused by Panetta's remarks reflects a political divide within the Obama administration over how quickly the United States can and should turn over responsibility for security to an Afghan government that remains weak.
Senior military officials cautioned that the U.S. forces would still be in the lead in battles abutting havens in Pakistan, where commanders believe insurgents still receive assistance from that country's intelligence service.
"We're still going to be fighting," said a senior military official in Kabul. "As time passes, we'll become more distant to the [Afghan forces] as they become more self-sufficient and capable across 2014-2015." The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because he did not want to appear as though he was contradicting his civilian leadership.
In Afghanistan, U.S. and Afghan officials have sought to build confidence among Afghan soldiers and civilians in the ability of the country's institutions to maintain security. 
For the past six months, Afghan and U.S. officials have held formal ceremonies to celebrate the transition of cities, districts and provinces to Afghan control - early steps toward a post-NATO Afghanistan.
Billboards have been posted across the country with photos of U.S. soldiers handing their guns over to their Afghan counterparts. Afghan units have begun crafting their own missions and going on independent patrols.
Such measures, although sometimes dismissed as hollow symbols by officials in Kabul, have prompted Afghan officers to play a more active role in traditionally NATO-led military operations, Western military officials say.
Though more than a dozen formal transition ceremonies have been held since last summer, most have been in relatively peaceful provinces or in small patches of cities, sometimes only a few square miles.
Those handovers are a far stretch from the challenges to come. American officials planned to use early transition exercises as a litmus test for the broader shift to Afghan control.
Afghan commanders questioned whether the looming security handover is a testament to their own progress or a product of U.S. politics and war weariness. "For those who understand the reality, Panetta's announcement sends a vague message. Many will argue, how can we trust the U.S. when they keep changing their words?" said Afghan Maj. Kosh Sadat.
Even among senior U.S. military commanders there has been a spirited debate over how quickly to press Afghan forces to take on more responsibility. 
This spring, American commanders will begin pairing up some of their small advisory teams with the more capable Afghan forces, U.S. officials said. The full complement of American advisory teams should be in place by early 2013.
Some U.S. military officials have pressed for giving Afghan units more responsibility sooner to test their ability to stand on their own as U.S. forces withdraw. "The time to figure out how good the Afghan forces are isn't in 2014," said Andrew Exum, a senior fellow with the Center for a New American Security. "It is now."
In Kabul, military officials worry about losing ground gained from the insurgency during tough battles over the past two years.
"In 2013, we are moving to the decisive portion of the campaign where the Afghan forces will be in the lead but heavily advised, assisted and enabled" by NATO forces, one senior military official said.
The Karzai administration appeared unfazed by Panetta's statement, with officials claiming that they are still confident the United States will remain a stabilizing force in Afghanistan.
"The international troops are focusing more on the strengthening, equipment and funding of Afghan forces, and this will make the Afghan forces self-sufficient and ready to take on this big responsibility," said Hakim Asher, a government spokesman. He called the statement a "natural part of the process of transition."
But to many in Washington, Panetta's remarks were interpreted as the latest sign of the administration's eagerness to bring the U.S. combat mission in Afghanistan to an end.
"We have interests in Afghanistan, but they are limited, so people are groping around for a limited way of dealing with it," said Stephen Biddle, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. "My worry is that we run the risk of backing into a situation where the investment we are making will not produce an adequate return."

Va. expected to lift gun limit

BYLINE: Laura Vozzella

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B01

LENGTH: 848 words

Virginia is poised to lift a 19-year-old limit on handgun purchases, with the Republican-controlled state Senate expected to do away with the one-gun-per-month cap in a final vote Friday.
With the purchase limit likely headed for extinction, Richmond appears to have grown friendlier to gun rights since _blankRepublicans took control of the evenly divided Senatelast month, pro-gun and gun-control activists agree. 
This week, the Senate passed a bill prohibiting localities from requiring that people seeking permits for concealed handguns submit fingerprints as part of their applications. The House passed a bill allowing government employees to store guns and ammunition in personal cars parked in workplace lots, including those at child-care centers and parks.
That is not to say the gun lobby will get everything it wants from this _blankGeneral Assembly session, even with the GOP in control of the House, Senate and governor's mansion. A Senate committee has killed two high-profile gun-rights proposals that would have done away with state background checks and prevented colleges from banning firearms on campus.
"It's going pretty well," said Philip Van Cleave, president of the Virginia Citizens Defense League. "It's by no means perfect. There are some good bills that aren't making it, but there are good bills that are. And I think we're seeing much more progress than we've seen the last several years."
Lori Haas, a gun-control activist whose daughter, Emily, was injured in the 2007 mass _blankshooting at Virginia Tech, said she thinks the General Assembly is moving in the wrong direction this year.
"Obviously, it says something about the Republicans that they pander to special-interest groups instead of law enforcement and the citizens of Virginia," she said.
More than 40 bills related to guns are before the General Assembly this session, most of them meant to expand gun rights and a handful aimed at restricting them. Repealing the one-gun-a-month limit is among the most high-profile goals of Richmond's gun lobby.
Pro-gun lawmakers have tried for years to eliminate the cap, imposed in 1993 under Democratic governor L. Douglas Wilder to curb the state's notorious role in gun trafficking along the East Coast.
Bills to remove the limit have passed the Republican-dominated House before. But they always died in Senate committees and subcommittees at the hands of the Democrats and moderate Republicans who long controlled the upper chamber.
This time around, with more conservative Republicans in the Senate, the bill _blankmade it out of committee. The full Senate passed it in a preliminary vote Thursday, one day after the House passed its own version of the measure. Gov. Robert F. McDonnell (R) has indicated that he will sign the legislation.
"Now that we have background checks that we didn't have [in 1993], one gun a month has outlived its purpose," Sen. Charles W. Carrico (R-Grayson), who sponsored the bill.
Carrico noted that over the years, the law had been changed to exempt law-enforcement officials and people with concealed-weapons permits from the limit. If collectors anticipated picking up several firearms at gun or antiques shows, they could simply apply to the state police for a permit exempting them from the cap for seven days, he said.
"I think everyone recognized the fact that the one-gun-a-month law has had so many exemptions made to it, so many carve-outs, that its usefulness has expired," he said. "When you're talking about Second Amendment rights, you try not to [afford them to citizens] piecemeal, and give some the authority and some not."
Senate Minority Leader Richard L. Saslaw (D-Fairfax), who opposed the legislation, predicted that illegal gun-running will once again thrive in the commonwealth.
"We're going to become the gun distribution center of the East Coast, just like we were before," he said.
The House passed a bill Thursday to allow city, town and county employees to store firearms and ammunition in personal cars parked at work. Some localities prohibit employees from doing so.
Under the bill, the guns must be inside a container and the vehicle must be locked. Opponents noted that the legislation does not require that the container itself be locked or that ammunition be stored out of sight.
Del. Brenda L. Pogge (R-York) said the measure would not apply to school parking lots, but she conceded that it would apply to lots at child-care centers, recreation centers and parks run by localities. The bill applies only to the parking lots, not the facilities themselves. The bill passed in a 75-25 vote.
Last week, a Senate committee killed a bill to prevent public universities from banning weapons from campuses. Gun-rights advocates, wearing bright orange stickers that read "Guns Save Lives," had suggested that armed students and faculty members could have curtailed the loss of life at Virginia Tech, where a shooter killed 32 people before taking his own life.
A House committee is still considering a bill that would allow faculty members at public universities to carry concealed weapons.

As officials vow to investigate, violence keeps Cairo on edge

DATELINE: CAIRO

CAIRO - Throngs of young Egyptians incensed over a deadly melee at a soccer match clashed with security forces in Cairo and Suez on Thursday night as the episode threatened to plunge the country into a new cycle of recriminations  and violence.
In Suez, police fatally shot two demonstrators, according to a health official quoted by the Associated Press. Protesters there and in Cairo focused their rage on the police, charging that they were either complicit or negligent in the fightbetween rival soccer fans that left at least 74 people dead on Wednesday. 
Egyptian officials on Thursday vowed to get to the bottom of Wednesday's clashes in Port Said and declared a three-day period of mourning.
Wednesday's bloody fighting followed a string of recent violent incidents that would have been nearly unthinkable during the three decades of autocratic rule under former President Hosni Mubarak. And it highlighted many Egyptians' concerns about the erosion of security in the country since a council of generals took control a year ago.

Ominous plots
Stunned by the evening's savagery, Egyptians pointed to ominous plots by domestic and foreign agents they accuse of working to undermine the aims of the revolutionaries that dethroned Mubarak. Many blamed the security forces for standing by as fans clashed using knives, rods and other sharp objects. A considerable number of the victims appear to have been crushed to death or slung from bleachers, according to witnesses.
In Suez, about 3,000 people demonstrated outside police headquarters after hearing that one of the victims of the Port Said riot was from their city, according to witnesses interviewed by AP. Police shot tear gas at the crowd, and then opened fire, the agency reported. It quoted health official Mohammed Lasheen as saying two men were killed by bullets and fifteen other protesters were wounded.
The demonstrations in Cairo were dominated by the young, ardent soccer fans known as "ultras" who have become a fixture of protests targeting the country's military rulers. They appeared convinced that Wednesday's fight had been instigated by the generals who have ruled the country since Mubarak's ouster.
"They killed our youth, they're killing us," said Aya Ibrahim, 21, a medical student who was among the thousands who streamed into Tahrir Square on Thursday afternoon. "They are totally responsible. This was planned. We will not allow any more blood to be shed."

Hundreds injured
About an hour after the sun set, however, large crowds of young men, many waving flags of regional soccer teams, walked in groups from Tahrir, the center of last year's uprising, toward the nearby headquarters of the Interior Ministry, which oversees the police.
The ministry said in a statement that protesters were trying to tear down barricades to break into the building. Security forces responded by firing rubber bullets and tear gas, witnesses said. More than 260 people were injured Thursday night, mostly from tear gas inhalation, a Health Ministry official told state television.
The scenes were reminiscent of deadly clashes in November between riot police and young protesters, many of whom were informally organized under the banner of the soccer teams they support. Those fights were sparked after security forces used aggressive tactics to prevent demonstrators from setting up a permanent protest camp in Tahrir.
The ensuing battles sparked a nationwide revolt against the country's interim military leaders, who grudgingly pledged to pass most of their power to an elected president in June, a speedier transition to civilian rule than they had originally outlined.
During the past year, Egypt's security forces have often found themselves in a tough spot. They come under fire when they stand on the sidelines of chaos but also receive harsh criticism when they intervene, sometimes using deadly force.
Many Egyptians saw the latest events as the most dramatic of what they think is an orchestrated wave of politically motivated incidents intended to provide the generals with a justification for delaying the transition to civilian rule.
The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, which won the most seats in the country's newly elected parliament, issued a statement blaming "dubious forces that still have strong ties with the former regime." In addition, the statement said, "there are, no doubt, foreign fingers that failed to take control of the Egyptian revolution."
Mahmoud Ghozlan, a senior member and spokesman for the Brotherhood, said he thinks foreign groups unhappy with the leading role of Islamists in post-revolutionary Egyptian politics are resorting to sabotage.

No immediate action
Lawmakers held a rancorous session Thursday during which some criticized the security forces and suggested that the interior minister - appointed by the generals - be sacked. The parliament members opted to form a committee to probe the incident.
Days before the stadium brawl in the Mediterranean city of Port Said, Egyptians were startled by a series of security incidents, including an armed robbery at a currency exchange shop in the resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh that left a French tourist dead.
"All we're hearing now about crimes is very new," said Ahmed Aboela, 27, a businessman in Cairo. "I am very surprised. These are not our morals."

'Mini-mayors' at it again

BYLINE: Editorial Board

SECTION: EDITORIAL COPY; Pg. A18

LENGTH: 391 words

IT WAS JUST two weeks ago that Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) was observing to us the misguided tendency of some of his colleagues to meddle in the local affairs of the District of Columbia. He noted that, as chairman of the House committee with oversight over the District, he has to fend off efforts from representatives who come to Washington and want to be its "mini-mayors." Imagine then our surprise to see Mr. Issa co-sponsoring a noxious measure that would impose stringent restrictions on abortions performed in the city. Hypocrisy knows no bounds when it comes to the rights of D.C. citizens. 
"The District of Columbia Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act," introduced by Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.), would prohibit abortions beyond the 20th week after fertilization. Modeled after laws in Nebraska, Kansas, Idaho, Oklahoma and Alabama, the bill is being pushed by the National Right to Life Committee, which, as the Hill reported, hopes to do election-year damage to President Obama and congressional Democrats by forcing them to take a potentially dangerous stand. According to NARAL Pro-Choice America, the bill is the first time a post-20-week abortion ban has been introduced in Congress.
Congressional interference in District business is nothing new - witness the ban on the District using its own tax dollars to pay for abortions for low-income women and the periodic attempts to eliminate needle exchange programs or overturn local gun control. But this measure is particularly offensive in that its backers defend it as a way to prevent the unborn from feeling terrible pain. "It would address the pain and suffering of children who have done nothing wrong," Mr. Franks said this week.
Putting aside the suspect science and the inherent constitutional issues, one has to question why Mr. Franks, Mr. Issa and other members of the GOP aren't insisting this  legislation be enacted for the entire nation - or, at the very, least for their own congressional districts. Is not the pain and suffering of children in California and Arizona a worry to them? Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) told The Post's Mike DeBonis that Republicans could get a vote on the nationwide bill but "it's just easier to go after the District." In other words, the District retains its status as political pawn, even for those who profess to be a friend.

Found footage without finesse

BYLINE: Mark Jenkins

SECTION: WEEKEND; Pg. T34

LENGTH: 498 words

Movies that purport to be constructed from found footage, in the manner of "The Blair Witch Project" and "The Devil Inside," usually do so to cloak a flimsy premise. That's not the issue with "Chronicle," in which a pretty good idea for a sci-fi thriller is undermined by hastiness - and by the pretense that it was mostly shot by one of its protagonists. 
That amateur cameraman is Andrew (Dane DeHaan), a Seattle area high-schooler with big problems. He's bullied at school and at home, where he lives with an alcoholic dad and a critically ill mom. At the beginning, Andrew announces that he's going to videotape his life. That doesn't seem a very likely pastime for a guy who's regularly abused and humiliated, but "Chronicle" pretends to be mostly his footage (with a little help from surveillance cameras and a video-blogger classmate).
Andrew's closest thing to a friend is his cousin Matt (Alex Russell), who regularly brings conversations to a halt by invoking Plato, Jung or Schopenhauer. One night, Matt and Andrew attend a rave, where they encounter Matt's longtime crush (Ashley Hinshaw), later to serve as the movie's damsel in distress. The guys wander off with Matt's pal Steve (Michael B. Jordan), a senior-class superstar.
In a development any superhero-origin buff will recognize, the boys crawl into a sinkhole and find a weird, perhaps extraterrestrial, substance that alters them. They develop superpowers, and Andrew, weakest of the three, becomes the strongest. His telekinesis is, uh, killer.
The guys have some adolescent fun with their gifts, doing "Jackass"-style stunts and lifting girls' skirts from a distance. But Matt and Steve have read enough Spider-Man - if not Schopenhauer - to know that with great power comes some responsibility. Andrew doesn't concur. The movie only runs about 80 minutes, so it literally doesn't take long before his existential despair yields mayhem.
"Chronicle" was made for about $15 million, just a few rusty bolts by "Iron Man" standards, and director Max Landis (son of "Animal House's" John Landis) must have used a lot of that budget for effects. We see the kids manipulate inanimate objects and levitate to the point that they're soaring, Superman-style, in the clouds. Also, the special effects crew had to insert the Space Needle into a movie that was shot in South Africa.
A few more bucks (or a little more thought) for the script would have been a better investment than faking Seattle. The characters are introduced so quickly, and their personalities are so thin, that what happens to them has little weight. And the allegedly homemade visuals, while offering a few witty touches, distract from the story. "Chronicle" can't finesse the essential problem of the found-footage genre: When faced with a potentially lethal threat, nobody's first instinct is to hit "record."

Terrapins women bounce back with victory over struggling Eagles

BYLINE: Gene Wang

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. D04

LENGTH: 594 words

Playing for the first time since its most dispiriting loss of the season one week ago, the ninth-ranked Maryland women's basketball team punished Boston College in the early stages on Thursday night and coasted the rest of the way for an 86-44 victorybefore 3,607 at Comcast Center that included the return of ACC leading scorer Alyssa Thomas.
A sore thumb kept Thomas on the bench last week against Virginia Tech, which dealt Maryland its second straight loss despite just two wins in conference at the time. Shortly after that game, the Terrapins vowed to rededicate themselves to begin the second half of their ACC schedule. 
With Thomas and Laurin Mincy leading the charge, Maryland (19-3, 6-3 ACC) did just that by building a 51-13 halftime lead on the strength of multiple barrages, most notably a 20-0 streak heading into the break. The Terrapins sank three of their 10 three-pointers during that stretch after a 13-1 flurry provided a 27-11 lead that had Maryland on its way to its most lopsided conference win in its last 70 games.
"I thought the first half was by far the most inspired, best effort and intensity that we've given to date, and it's encouraging," Maryland Coach Brenda Frese said. "I thought it showed a lot of character from our last time out."
Thomas finished with 14 points and eight rebounds and was able to rest for a good portion of the second half with the outcome all but settled. Thomas injured her thumb during practice two days after Maryland lost at No. 5 Duke, 80-72, on Jan. 22, and the sophomore forward had a cast fitted for precautionary reasons.
Last season's ACC rookie of the year who is averaging 19.3 points per game had the cast removed on Friday and was back at practice early this week. It took Thomas six seconds to score against the Eagles (5-17, 0-9), who lost their ninth in a row, shot 21 percent and were outrebounded, 50-43. 
"It just felt good to be back on the court with my team," said Thomas, who played five minutes in the second half.
Thomas scored six of Maryland's first 11 points and finished the first half with 12 points, six rebounds, three assists and two steals. She shot 6 for 9 and did not commit a turnover in 14 minutes. 
When Thomas wasn't busy getting baskets in the lane, Mincy was doing her part from long distance. The sophomore guard scored 13 of her game-high 16 points in the first half and made four of her five three-pointers before intermission.
Thomas "brings so much to our team," Mincy said. "She brings a lot energy. She picks us up. When she's doing her thing, we just follow her lead." 
Freshman guard Brene Moseley (Paint Branch) also scored 16 points on 6-of-9 shooting that included 3 for 4 from three-point range, and senior forward-center Lynetta Kizer chipped in with 12 points, five rebounds, two assists and two steals.
In leading from start to finish, Maryland shot 47 percent overall, 56 percent from three-point range and made 12 of 14 free throws. The Terrapins outscored Boston College inside 38-14, collected 25 points off 16 turnovers and never trailed by fewer than 25 points in the second half.
The comfortable margin also enabled Frese to give ample minutes to seldom-used reserves such as junior center Essence Townsend and sophomore guard Sequoia Austin (Holton-Arms). Maryland got 44 points from its bench players.
"In the first half we were really locked in," Frese said. "Our ball pressure was really good. Our help-side defense I thought was tremendous. We communicated extremely well, and obviously having the bench on our end is a big assist."

Veteran is convicted of killing his father, 75

BYLINE: Justin Jouvenal

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B08

LENGTH: 553 words

As his father napped one evening last summer, prosecutors said, Richard Hanson grabbed a pistol from the top of a cabinet in their Springfield home, walked into the bedroom and fired five shots into the man's face.
The son pulled the bedroom door closed. Then he drove to 7-Eleven to buy a six-pack of beer and some scratch-off lottery tickets before fleeing the state, witnesses said.
On Thursday, a Fairfax County Circuit Court jury found the 54-year-old Army veteran guilty of first-degree murder in the killing of Gary P. Hanson and of a related firearms charge. They recommended a sentence of 25 years in prison. 
Prosecutors were at loss for a motive, and the crime stood in stark contrast to the "gentle giant" whom family and neighbors described on the stand and vowed to support while he was in prison.
"This defendant killed his father in cold blood," said Assistant Commonwealth's Attorney Robert D. McClain. "What makes this killing all the more terrifying is that we don't know why."
Richard Hanson pleaded not guilty, and public defenders Vernida Chaney and Diego Alcala Laboy said he suffered from a drinking problem. They described him as a "caregiver" who babysat for neighborhood children, helped his mother with gardening and took his father on golf outings.
"These actions were horrific, and many lives were affected in this courtroom," Alcala Laboy told jurors after they returned the verdict. "These acts are not Richard Hanson."
Curtis Hanson, Richard Hanson's younger brother, testified in the trial that he had clashed with his brother on July 19, the day of the killing, at the home on Chancellor Way they shared with their parents. It appeared his brother had been drinking, he testified, and things became so heated that he contemplated shooting him.
Curtis Hanson and the brothers' mother, Rosalinde, left for a dentist's appointment shortly before 5 p.m., he testified. A short time later, prosecutors said, Richard Hanson shot his father, a retired lawyer with the Veterans Administration. The son fled in his family's green Saturn with his father's wallet, the murder weapon and insulin to treat his diabetes.
Curtis and Rosalinde Hanson arrived home to find Gary Hanson, 75, fatally shot. In a 911 call played in court, Curtis Hanson identified his brother as the likely killer. His mother could be heard crying in the background.
"I cannot believe that son of a [expletive]," he told a dispatcher.
Richard Hanson was arrested two days laterat a Red Carpet Inn in Scranton, Pa. Prosecutors said the .45-caliber Glock handgun he used to shoot his father was found in the trunk of the Saturn.
Richard Hanson didn't take the stand, and during the trial, the defense rested without calling a witness. Hanson was unemployed at time of the shooting, but he had once been employed by Fairfax County as a maintenance worker.
Before the jury made its sentencing recommendation, Curtis and Rosalinde Hanson and neighbors took the stand to speak on behalf of Richard Hanson.
Rosalinde Hanson said the family was "close-knit" and described how Richard and his father watched football together. They said they talked to Richard regularly after his arrest and put money in a jail account for him.
"I still love my brother unconditionally, despite what the facts are," Curtis Hanson testified.

ELEPHANT ROOM
At Arena Stage through Feb. 26n
"Elephant Room," written and performed by Steve Cuiffo, Geoff Sobelle and Trey Lyford, would look far more comfortable in some ramshackle, claustrophobic space, where its raw aesthetics and ironic sensibility might not pose the glaring counterpoint that it does to refined surroundings. As it is, the 70-minute show comes across as a thin - and occasionally downright sloppy - riff on the sorry state of that quaint staple of birthday parties and down-market casinos, the professional magician. Or is the magic rickety by design? It's ultimately not transparent, for instance, whether the three performers intend here to demystify magic, mock it or honor it. If all these guys are doing is making us feel silly for having believed, then "Elephant Room" is a meaner-spirited piece than I'm allowing for. In any event, it's probably the kind of entertainment best viewed by an audience in an altered state. Because in one's right frame of mind, the show reveals it has very little up its sleeve.

gTHE GAMING TABLE
At Folger Theatre through March 4
Folger Theatre further expands Washington's classical borders with this send-up of 18th-century social probity by the Restoration-comedy playwright Susanna Centlivre. Name doesn't ring a bell? That's partly why this piquant dish, mounted with considerable aplomb by director Eleanor Holdridge and dressed to the sensational nines by Jessica Ford, comes with a side of pleasant discovery. With its employment of rhyming couplets and laughter at the expense of decadent aristocracy, it subscribes to many of the theatrical and satirical conventions of its time. But it also seems, to some unusual degree, to assert the right of women to aspirations other than marriage. Given the large number of romantic couplings, the construction of the comic architecture does take a bit of forbearance. But Holdridge does a good job holding it together, in the harmonizing of the visual and narrative elements. And Ford's gorgeous gowns imbue the physical production with a soignee irresistibility. The energy and design savvy applied to Centlivre stimulate an appetite for more work by people you didn't know existed.

gLAUGHTER ON THE 23RD FLOOR
At Church Street Theater through Feb. 18
So seven guys and a gal walk into a dumpy office in Manhattan, dip into the coffee, bagels and Danish, and start crackin' wise. They write sketches for a hit 1950s TV show starring someone very much like Sid Caesar, but who's called Max Prince. Their raucous yet intimate staging is, with few minor exceptions, well cast and performed with the kind of clockwork timing that a Neil Simon script requires. Our guide through the chaos is Lucas, presumably based on the young playwright, a wannabe writer hired by Prince on a trial basis. We meet the other writers as they amble, saunter or shlump into work. Angst burbles between the laughs in Simon's play. Who knew that Keegan Theatre, a company better known for staging Irish and American melodramas, and more recently musicals, could dive into Neil Simon at his shtickiest and come up trumps?

gRED
At Arena Stage through March 11
For all its highfalutin discourse, the most engrossing moment of Arena Stage's immensely enjoyable "Red" comes when the two actors dip their brushes into buckets and paint. The activity in which the superbly matched Edward Gero and Patrick Andrews engage, in point of fact, is priming a canvas half again as tall as the two of them. The pleasure of the interlude is in the way it conveys the full, symbiotic immersion of the characters: Gero's Mark Rothko, the vain, abrasive creator of all those mesmerizing canvases of migrating mood and undulating color, and Andrews's Ken, a composite of the assistants who toiled in Rothko's Manhattan studio. Rothko acknowledges anxiety over the pop-art movement that is supplanting abstract expressionism. Ken pricks Rothko's conscience. Both the painter and his assistant know from pain; it's as certain an ingredient in their work as the pigments they mix. Maybe that helps explain why Rothko and his young employee find in the act of priming a canvas a cathartic common pursuit. They don't simply aim to prime that canvas. They want to unleash the Furies on it.

A COMMEDIA ROMEO & JULIET
At Flashpoint through Saturday
You never noticed the yuks in "Romeo and Juliet's" graveyard scene? Well, Matthew R. Wilson, who heads the commedia dell'arte-focused Faction of Fools Theatre Company, is one up on you. As director and co-adapter of the company's cheerfully rough-hewn play, Wilson seizes on and spins a couple of Shakespeare's lines, with the result that poignant suspense becomes slapstick. The schtick exemplifies the flavor of this scrappy production, which delivers its largely irreverent humor lickety-split while commenting on entwining influences in classical art. Unfolding against black curtains, the stage business pivots around a huge trunk. At a recent performance, however, the trunk repeatedly malfunctioned, forcing the actors to fiddle with it while ad-libbing. They handled the situation with winking aplomb. Of course, such ad-libbing arguably smacks of commedia technique, as does the capering, roughhousing physicality the actors display throughout the play.

gAMELIA, A STORY OF ABIDING LOVE
At Mount Vernon Place United Methodist Church Undercroft Theatre through Feb. 12
A corner of the Civil War comes vividly to life in this Washington Stage Guild production, which is about as far from cutting-edge theater as you can get. It is, instead, a trip back in time powered by good words, deft acting and clear direction. With his crystalline staging of the play, Artistic Director Bill Largess does extremely well by actor/playwright Alex Webb. Only two actors populate the small stage - Shirleyann Kaladjian as the title character, and Webb as everyone else. In one sense, the play is a showcase for Webb's chameleon-like acting skills. But tour de force showcase or not, Webb has written a lovely script and found a feisty acting partner in Kaladjian, to whom he is married in real life. She's all sharp edges and strong opinions - a steely 1861 Pennsylvania farm girl whose refusal to flirt or flatter could doom her to spinsterhood. It is her luck and her tragedy that she finds love. Then war breaks out, and her man joins up. Clad in the uniform of a dead Union soldier, Amelia slogs southward to find him, even letting herself be taken prisoner. "Amelia" is a rather staid piece of theater, and its final scene loses an emotional coup de grace by ending too quickly. Yet the Stage Guild's handsome production is highly affecting overall.

THE GALLERIST
At Atlas Performing Arts Center through Feb. 19
So, was the comely Selena Featherstone possessed by a pygmy capuchin monkey named Iago? Not the sort of question one wrestles with on a typical night out. But then "The Gallerist" strives mightily to avoid any contact with the typical. A fusion of gothic horror, Freudian intrigue and lesbian romance, Fengar Gael's drama, in a world premiere by Rorschach Theatre, is tantalizingly oddball, though it would seem to require a more effervescent treatment than director Catherine Tripp's often muted approach allows. Selena's modern-day descendant, the seriously creepy Bertram Plover, narrates the story of Selena from a New York jail cell. A century earlier in London, Selena's mother beseeches Selena's cousin Laura to allow Selena to live with her after Selena massacres a roomful of her family's pet birds. Laura, an artist who's ditched by her snooty art-critic boyfriend after he decides she's talentless, takes Selena in and begins to paint the birds Selena describes from memory - paintings that will end up in Plover's hands 100 years on. Louise Schlegel and Blair Bowers have by far the most demanding roles, made trickier by the scenes in which Selena, in "Exorcist" style, must seem to spew Iago's verbal bile. They both hold their own in a promising piece that manages to go out on a limb and yet still feels as if it could be allowed to venture out a little bit further.

GLEAM
At Centerstage through Sunday
The tale centers on the story's heroine, Janie, and her rough journey through three husbands in backwater Florida beginning at age 16. Visually, the production is spare but crisp as a storybook. It sets the stage for tall tales and heightened acting, led especially by Axel Avin Jr. and Brooks Edward Brantly. Avin plays Jody Starks, the second husband who triumphs over Eatonville, and he's equally compelling as the seducer who lures Janie away from her geezer first husband and as the cad who merely wants to show off the famously pretty Janie. Brantly is a charmer as Tea Cake, the free spirit who turns out to be Janie's deepest, truest partner. He and Christiana Clark's Janie ease into each other wonderfully as the characters meet in Janie's store; they have a formality that adds a lovely tension to the budding romance. As Janie, Clark grows declamatory now and then, but she mainly stays in tune with the slow-burning soul of Janie's long, adventurous trip, which puts a painful kick in the tale's tragic climax.

gHAIRSPRAY
At Signature Theatre through Sunday
The production is zippily paced and highly kinetic, thanks in part to witty choreography. Evoking and building on 1960s dance fads, choreographers Karma Camp and Brianne Camp have created a body of capering, whimsically gestural movement that epitomizes the youthful ebullience of Tracy Turnblad (Carolyn Cole) and her peers. "Hairspray" is a Cinderella story in which the fairy godmother is dance, while the ready-to-blossom scullery maids include Tracy, her plus-size mother, Edna, and, oh, yes, 1962 Baltimore. When Tracy's high-spirited hoofin' earns her a slot on "The Corny Collins Show," she finds herself struggling to reform the televised dance program's racially segregated format. It would be a plus if she could also snag the affection of teenage dreamboat Link Larkin. The cast is hard to fault, from Cole (who can nail a song, as well as a bit of shtick) right down to the accomplished ensemble.

gLA CAGE AUX FOLLES
At the Kennedy Center Eisenhower Theater through Feb. 12
Christopher Sieber and George Hamilton, who play a lovingly bickering (un)married couple headlining and running a risque Riviera nightclub, form an appealing comic union. As dashing major-domo Georges, the 72-year-old Hamilton manages to shelve for the occasion the self-regarding rake of old and to portray with charm and dignity the cooler-headed half of a gay couple. Sieber has the requisite big presence for Albin, an old-line drag star. The musical tends to go all mushy, especially in the handling of Albin's rejection by the boy he and Georges raised, Jean-Michel, on the day Jean-Michel is bringing home for the first time his fiancee, her timid mother and homophobic politician father. There are some bona fide lump-in-the-throat moments, courtesy of Sieber and the authentic emotional dive Albin takes after the champagne bubble of his maternal role is initially burst, and Jean-Michel says he doesn't want Albin at the dinner with his fiancee and her parents. Hamilton's lightness of being is an aid here, as he winningly conveys the notion of a man trying to juggle the loyalties in his life while maintaining a sense of Gallic bonhomie. And the overall fitness of this touring version reinforces "La Cage's" place in musical theater as a melodic homage to families of all stripes.

gTHE SNOWY DAY
At Glen Echo Park Adventure Theatre through Feb. 12
It's no surprise that this musical, making its world premiere, turns out to be a different creature from Ezra Jack Keats's Caldecott Medal-winning picture book. Writer David Emerson Toney and composer-lyricist Darius Smith ratchet up Peter's boisterousness quotient and pair him with some quirky acquaintances, including a snow pirate, an anxious snowman and an acrophobic bird who's fond of succotash. With these eccentric companions, the boy plunges into a few mild adventures and a Caribbean-flavored dream. It's a storyline that may strike adult ticketholders as somewhat arbitrarily plotted, but younger audiences will find the production both funny and enthralling. Widely recognized as the first picture book to feature a black child as the central character, Keats's classic featured eye-catching gouache-and-collage illustrations. Echoes of that art show up in the musical. All in all, the play's humor and tunefulness are less satisfying than the picture book's mood of quiet wonder, but the book will always be there for re-reading.

gTIME STANDS STILL
At Studio Theatre through Feb. 19
Why is it that a loving relationship is more apt to withstand bombs than the dormant aftermath? Playwright Donald Margulies poses this question in the steadily engrossing drama performed with the polish of a splendidly synchronized string quartet. The four actors at director Susan Fenichell's keenly realized command apply a completely convincing varnish to the framework of Margulies's story about two journalists returning from harrowing stints in Iraq. James has come home with shattered nerves: The nomadic life of a war correspondent has lost its romance for him. Sarah, a widely admired war photographer, returns gravely injured after a roadside bombing. But she is not, apparently, cured of the job's adrenaline rush. Therein lies the central tension. The play dances on the edge of James's and Sarah's bottled anger, especially as they're forced to confront the warmer, cozier love between their magazine editor and his new, dewy girlfriend. The evening's solid state reaffirms a perception that what Studio puts on its stages these days is all aspiring - and often coming close to - a gold standard.

THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA
At Lansburgh Theatre through March 4
The Shakespeare Theatre Company's entertaining but over-the-top "The Two Gentlemen of Verona" wastes no time coming at you. PJ Paparelli's production of Shakespeare's comedy about double-crossing friends opens in a fast-food parking lot with teenagers engaging in binge drinking. Yes, it's a comedy: The play has two clowns and a dog, and the lovers and friends spend a lot of time swapping witty repartee. But the emotional switchbacks are sharp, and the play's sudden ending threatens real violence. If the show doesn't quite click, it's largely because of its cineplex-style use of U2 tunes and firearms. Music is oxygen in this milieu, of course, but some of the songs are so painfully on the nose as to be eye-rolling. There are "Glee"-spirited moments that will make you laugh, but that's offset by the sense of applying an easy pop patch where the characters or story seem reluctant to fly. But the big test of how you feel about this lively "Two Gents" is how you respond to its violence. Some of the chase scenes and scuffles are fabulous, but this weaponized show repeatedly pushes its kids to extreme moments of despair and self-damage with razors and pistols, making this play darker and more disturbing. In his last plays, Shakespeare used magic and an expansive spirit to make us accept crazy tales. For the rougher "Two Gents," Paparelli gets it done at gunpoint.

Family Filmgoer reviews 'Big Miracle,' 'Chronicle,' 'Woman in Black,' 'The Grey'

BYLINE: Jane Horwitz

SECTION: WEEKEND; Pg. T36

LENGTH: 916 words

PG
BIG MIRACLE. This 1980s true story, based on news accounts and a 1989 book, could have been a treacly, unchallenging "family film." Instead, it's a sharply defined, lightly comic slice of Americana for anyone 10 or older. The story is about three whales trapped under ice off the coast of Alaska, and the film drolly examines the political and philosophical fault lines of the Reagan era as different people work together to save them.
THE BOTTOM LINE: The strongest element for kids younger than 10 will be the sheer suspense about whether the whales will survive and make it to the open sea. The script contains some salty language, and adults drink. Spoiler alert: There is one whale death. We don't see it happen, but we do see its injured snout and hear its labored breathing. 
ג[#x20ac][#x201a]

PG-

13
THE WOMAN IN BLACK.ג[#x20ac][#x201a]Based on a novel by Susan Hill, this movie is a well-made throwback - a handsome rendering of a ghost story set in Victorian England. Many high-schoolers will revel in its rich atmosphere and shriek-inducing ghostly visits. That overall spookiness may be too much for middle-schoolers. In a prologue, we see three girls jump to their deaths, seemingly hypnotized by the spirit of the title. Years later, lawyer Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe, in his post-"Harry Potter" debut) has come to the village to settle a dowager's estate. He is determined to get to the bottom of the ghostly mystery.
THE BOTTOM LINE: The film depicts ghostly spirits, many of them children. In several scenes, children are led to their deaths by the Woman in Black. A spirit reenacts a hanging suicide, and other flashbacks show a child drowned. We see bloody sheets where Arthur's wife died in childbirth. Characters drink.
CHRONICLE.ג[#x20ac][#x201a]On a whim, three high-school boys explore an unusual cave in this cleverly made sci-fi saga, and the telekinetic powers they develop after their exposure to an unearthly material there leads them first to fun and then to tragedy. A strong cast of young actors and clever visual effects created on a budget make "Chronicle" an absorbing adventure but perhaps too violent and emotionally tortured for middle-schoolers, despite its PG-13 rating.
THE BOTTOM LINE: As one of the boys grows increasingly unhappy at home, he lashes out violently, and the results are injuries and death. The violence - people thrown to their deaths, explosions, buildings wrecked - is not graphic but it is loud, fast and upsetting. One incident involves an impalement. Characters use occasional profanity, and it's implied that teens drink beer at a party. Andrew's dad is usually drunk, with bottles all around. His mother is on oxygen and looks very ill.
ONE FOR THE MONEY.ג[#x20ac][#x201a]Katherine Heigl is bumbling bounty hunter Stephanie Plum in this comedy/crime thriller. Though rated PG-13, the movie contains a lot of crudely implied sexual humor, and some rough gun violence nears R range, so it's not for middle-schoolers. High-schoolers may find it puzzling, as it never locks onto a particular tone, beginning in a sort of offbeat Coen brothers style, then wandering into farce and back again.
THE BOTTOM LINE: The script includes a lot of midrange profanity, occasionally stronger stuff and sexual innuendo with briefly implied nudity. The gunplay gets intense in a couple of scenes. Characters drink and handle a shipment of heroin.

R
THE GREY. Based on a short story by Ian Mackenzie Jeffers, who wrote the script with director Joe Carnahan, "The Grey" feels like a throwback to a Jack London adventure in which men test their mettle against whatever nature throws at them. Teens 15 and older with strong stomachs will find it mighty enthralling. Terrifically acted and handsomely made, "The Grey" is both a thriller and a dark night of the soul for a tough group of men, led by John Ottway, who protects an Alaskan oil crew from wolves. Ottway has a Captain Ahab-like obsession with the beasts. The movie isn't for kids younger than high school age, but it's an unusually cool piece of work.
THE BOTTOM LINE: The wolf attacks themselves are not highly graphic, but the foreboding leading up to them and the size of the animatronic and computer-animated creatures - yellow eyes, huge teeth - make the attacks feel graphic. And the views of the mutilated victims are graphic. The action includes a harrowing plane crash, gunplay and fistfights. Characters drink and use strong profanity. Themes of suicide, loss of faith and an existential sense of nothingness weave throughout.
UNDERWORLD: AWAKENING. High-schoolers who enjoy vampire sagas of a more violent strain than the "Twilight" films will have plenty to chew on in "Underworld: Awakening." The melding of live action and special effects, subtly intensified in 3-D, works handsomely, but the violence is too gory for middle-schoolers. In a prologue, the three previous films are summarized, but this film is still tough to follow. The vampire heroine, Selene, recalls how she was captured while trying to save her human/Lycan (werewolf) lover from humans. She was frozen for 12 years and escaped from a lab. An even more deadly form of werewolf has escaped annihilation. Selene impales, beheads and chops her way to the truth of what occurred.
THE BOTTOM LINE: The violence includes beheadings, impalings, bone-splinterings and head-bashing fights. References to genocidal "cleansing" of the "nonhumans" are disturbing. One scene includes implied nudity, and there is very occasional profanity.

Madonna, Trump, Snooki and more: TV's grand day

BYLINE: Lisa De Moraes

SECTION: STYLE; Pg. C05

LENGTH: 1146 words

A huge day in television:
1. Madonna announced she would not allow her wardrobe to malfunction during NBC's broadcast of her Super Bowl halftime show Sunday. 
2. "Celebrity Apprentice" star Donald Trump endorsed GOP presidential hopeful Mitt Romney on the eve of his reality-competition show's season debut.
3. CBS News has been given access to George Clooney's house.
and 
4. Snooki's new series has been offered a home.
First things first:
"How can you guarantee against a wardrobe malfunction, given your history?" one middle-aged guy asked Madonna at a news conference Thursday in Indianapolis, as though he suspected she had something up her bustier.
"Is that something you're thinking about?" he added, pointedly.
"Oh, yes," she responded with poise. "Great attention to detail has been paid to my wardrobe. There will be no wardrobe malfunctions."
"Promise."
Madonna is, once again, a trailblazer - the first non-guy Super Bowl halftime star since Janet Jackson had a breastplate ripped off her costume by Justin Timberlake, exposing her right breast for about a half-second during the 2004 halftime show at Super Bowl XXXVIII.
The "wardrobe malfunction," as the incident became known, resulted in a record $550,000 fine levied by the Federal Communications Commission against TV stations owned by CBS, which broadcast that year's Super Bowl - and the effective banning of female halftime headliners. Since then, only Viagra Generation guys have been allowed to star in Super Bowl halftime shows, starting with Paul McCartney in '05, followed in subsequent years by the Rolling Stones and Prince.
Prince tried his best to break down this boys' club in 2007. During a halftime solo, his silhouette and that of his guitar were projected onto some large flowing sheet-like thinggummy, casting what some saw as a phallic symbol. The TV networks reacted in the only possible way: doubling down their ban on female halftime performers.
Since Prince, halftime entertainment has been provided by Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, and the Who.
Then last year, there was a glimmer of hope when the Black Eyed Peas - including its female singer, Fergie - were hired to be the halftime headliners.

CBS getting personal
CBS News announced the lineup for its exhumation of Edward R. Murrow's celebrities-at-home series "Person to Person," debuting at 8 p.m. Wednesday. 
Anchors Charlie Rose and Lara Logan have been granted access to George Clooney's Los Angeles home and Jon Bon Jovi's "magnificent" home on the Navesink River in New Jersey that includes a private recording studio. And though not allowing access to his billionaire-ish home, billionaire Warren Buffett has granted the two access to his Omaha office. 
" 'Person to Person' shows you how Hollywood's most popular leading man unwinds away from the lenses of the paparazzi, where perhaps the world's most successful investor conducts his billion-dollar deals, and the home studio where one of the world's most legendary rockers composes and records his music," CBS News hyperventilated in Thursday's announcement. 
Back in December, CBS News announced that it was exhuming "Person to Person" during the February sweep in the Wednesday-at-8 time slot. 
These days, any time CBS News mentions Murrow, The Reporters Who Cover Television reflexively begin to genuflect. But when Murrow's show debuted, this kind of celebs-at-their-leisure access was rare. (Murrow took viewers into the homes of such celebrities as Groucho and Harpo Marx, Fidel Castro, John and Jacqueline Kennedy, Elizabeth Taylor, Marilyn Monroe, former president Harry Truman, Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, John Steinbeck, Marlon Brando, and Sammy Davis Jr.)
Now, in this Age of Ryan Seacrest and TMZ, you have to beat away glimpses of celebrities at-leisure with a stick. 

Pa. wants Snooki
Two days after Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer fired off a letter emphatically denying MTV and 495 Productions permission to film a planned "Jersey Shore" spinoff in the public areas of that city, Jersey Shore, Pa., welcomed the show with open arms.
Zimmer shooed Snooki and JWoww away, she said, "based on protecting public safety and quality-of-life concerns for Hoboken residents." 
Central Pennsylvania Film Office commissioner Lorena Beniquez told the Associated Press they'd be tickled pink to have the two hard-partying, gym/tan/laundry gals. 
"Most of the time, when we make headlines, it's for the Little League World Series," Beniquez said. "Or the gas industry. We want to be known for something once the gas industry is done and gone."
The Hoboken mayor, in a terse letter to MTV and the Beverly Hills, Calif., production company, put the producers, the network and network-parent Viacom on "formal notice" that any effort to come to "verbal agreements" to film in public areas with "payments to individuals" is a criminal offense and would be "dealt with immediately and aggressively by the City of Hoboken." (The mayor said city officials had been led to believe that these agreements and payments occasionally occurred in other locations, in lieu of permits, while shooting "Jersey Shore.) 
Jersey Shore, Pa., borough manager Gretchen Spiecher, however, says: "It would be fun to have the spotlight on the borough" if Snooki and JWoww came to film. 
"But we'd like to know what the show's going to be about, will it be shot inside or outside," noted Spiecher, adding: "I would like to know because I've never seen ['Jersey Shore']."

Trump's gift of pub
With just more than two weeks before he returns to the TV boardroom to judge the executive skills of Clay Aiken, Victoria Gotti and Arsenio Hall, "Celebrity Apprentice" star Donald Trump held a news conference in Las Vegas on Thursday to announce that he was endorsing GOP candidate Mitt Romney.
"Virtually anybody that we do business with throughout the world, they take advantage of us, they laugh at us," Trump told reporters at his Trump International Hotel. "Mitt is tough, he's smart, he's sharp" and "he's not going to allow bad things to continue to happen to this country that we all love. So, go out and get 'em. You can do it."
It was covered by all three cable news networks: Fox News Channel, CNN and, of course, MSNBC, which is a cable cousin of "Celebrity Apprentice" network NBC. It was also covered by many other media outlets, including The Washington Post. 
This is very good publicity for "Celebrity Apprentice" and for NBC, which can use all the publicity it can get this season. 
Trump's big political swings and his "Celebrity Apprentice" schedule sometimes seem to go hand in hand. 
Back in April, when "Celebrity Apprentice" was gearing up for the May sweeps ratings derby, Trump revealed that he was so doubtful as to President Obama's birthplace that he sent a team of his own investigators to Hawaii in hopes of getting to the bottom of the issue.

Va. GOP crams in social agenda

BYLINE: Laura Vozzella;Anita Kumar

LENGTH: 1093 words

DATELINE: RICHMOND

RICHMOND - The Republican revolution is on in Richmond.
Virginia Republicanshttp://www.washingtonpost.com/vaassembly have aggressively pursued a conservative agendasince taking over all of state government, steamrolling Democrats along the way.
Less than a month into the _blankGeneral Assembly session, Republicans have passed bills expanding gun rights and rolling back abortion rights, gay rights and - at least as Democrats see it - voting rights. Dozens of other bills remain in the works.
Although it's no surprise that Republicans would go after those issues, the speed with which they have gotten them past floor votes has surprised some Richmond observers. 
"There's a pent-up demand,'' said former lieutenant governor John H. Hager, a Republican who presided over the state Senate for four years. "It says who's in charge."
Republicans have not gotten everything they wanted - particularly on abortion and guns - but they have managed with relative ease to approve far-reaching bills. Many of the bills passed the House of Delegates for years but always died at the hands of Democrats and moderate Republicans in the Senate.
Now, with the GOP in control of the upper chamber, and more conservative Republicans part of it, the full Senate voted this week to require women to undergo an ultrasoundbefore an abortion. On Monday, it is expected to repeal a two-decade-old lawlimiting handgun purchases to one per month.
Already out of committee and on their way to full Senate votes are bills to subject welfare recipients to drug testing and allow faith-based adoption agencies to turn away, for religious reasons, gays seeking to adopt children.
But those victories come with risks.
Many Republicans, elected last fall primarily on the economy and jobs, could face a backlash in their districts for pushing social causes. And there is a special drawback in an election year in which many Republican candidates for president and the U.S. Senate will need to court independent voters in the swing state, said Stephen Farnsworth, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington.
"What they've wanted, what they've dreamed of, is coming true," Farnsworth said. "But in the larger electoral context, this may be a very painful course of action if it costs Republicans the presidency or what could be the decisive Senate seat for control of the upper chamber in Washington."
Gov. Robert F. McDonnell, a Republican who won decisively by downplaying social issues, has said he would sign the ultrasound and one-gun-a-month repeal measures.
The Republican legislative gains have come in a session that began with Democrats vowing to stop the GOP - with legal actionand arcane parliamentary maneuvers - from taking control of the Senate. Both strategies failed. And now Democrats find themselves mostly powerless to stop what they see as Virginia's hard right turn.
Opposed to bills that would apply stricter standards for identification at polling places, Democrats threw out heated rhetoric this week at a rally and on the floor of the House and Senate. They invoked lynching, Jim Crow, Stalin. They created a Twitter hashtag for the occasion: #NotOnOurWatch.
But with one voter ID measure passing the House this week and the other on track to clear the Senate on Monday, there was a sense that Democrats were not able to do much more than watch.
Sen. Janet D. Howell (D-Fairfax) knew Democrats had no chance of derailing the bill requiring ultrasounds before abortions, so she offered a _blankfloor amendmentthat made such a mockery of it that it drew national attention.
"Prior to prescribing medication for erectile dysfunction, a physician shall perform a digital rectal examination and a cardiac stress test," her amendment read. It died in a 19 to 21 partisan vote.
Likewise, Sen. A. Donald McEachin (D-Henrico) offered what he conceded was a futile bill to prohibit state-funded adoption agencies from discriminating against gay couples. "I'm an eternal optimist," he said.
Democrats still have some sway in the Senate, which November's elections left evenly split, with 20 Republicans and 20 Democrats. 
Republicans claimed the majority because Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling (R) can break tie votes in the Senate. Democrats, who contended that Bolling's voting authority was limited, failed to get a power-sharing deal.
Democrats sued, seeking to block Bolling from voting on key matters of Senate organization, including the committee assignments that determine which bills make it to the floor and which die. The suit is pending, but the judge turned down a request before the session started to issue a temporary injunction blocking the Senate takeover.
Bolling has conceded that his voting power does not extend to the budget, constitutional amendments and judicial appointments - the only areas where Democrats hope to have some power.
Democrats were able toflaunt what power they havein the Senate a week ago, when they held up judicial nominations in a way that also halted the business of the Senate. Republicans eventually blinked, pulling the names of two nominees the Democrats had objected to. But even that victory was fairly empty. Democrats did not, in fact, oppose the nominees, simply the timing of their nominations. The two are expected to be confirmed for the bench by the end of the session.
Even with Republicans in control of both chambers, some of the most conservative bills have died.
A Senate committee has killed two high-profile gun-rights proposals that would have done away with state background checks and prevented colleges from banning firearms on campus. Another committee killed a bill to ban most abortionsafter 20 weeks after a woman testified that she terminated her pregnancy because of medical problems.
On Friday, Democrats took to the House floor to bitterly complain about Republicans' actions in the General Assembly.
"In four weeks, we have been distracted by divisive social issues,'' House Minority Leader David J. Toscano (D-Charlottesville) said. "There have been bills on abortion, bills on guns, bills on gays. . . . This is not what the majority of Virginians elected us to do."
Republicans shot back in passionate speeches, saying bills on guns and abortion are just a small number of the hundreds of measures that have been debated.
"They only represent a very small portion of the fine work that we have done,'' House Deputy Majority Leader C. Todd Gilbert (R-Shenandoah) said. "We are, in fact, focused on jobs, creating the economic environment that will bring Virginia back."

For Romney and Paul,a strategic alliance?
Despite deep differences on a range of issues, Mitt Romney and Ron Paul became friends in 2008, the last time both ran for president. The former Massachusetts governor compliments the Texas congressman during debates. The Romney-Paul alliance is more than a curious connection. It is a strategic partnership: for Paul, an opportunity to gain a seat at the table if his long-shot bid for the presidency fails; for Romney, a chance to gain support from one of the GOP's most vibrant subgroups.

Despite the manifest misery of the Wizards, they've sold more tickets this season than last, when they were bad, but not this bad. And die-hard fans believe there's a light at the end of the tunnel. Read the  story at postlocal.com.
D.C. film
Even as Washington story lines are enjoying a boom in movies and television, the nation's capital is losing more and more of the actual location work to other cities. No matter how much art directors crave Washington's majestic vistas, they quickly run into twin deal-killers: Filming in the security-obsessed federal core has become a hair-pulling hassle, and the District government lacks the money to compete with incentives.

'Soul Train' proprietor
Don Cornelius, a broadcasting pioneer who created and hosted the groundbreaking weekly dance and music show, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound Wednesday at age 75. Recognizing that the major TV networks had virtually no programs geared toward black audiences in 1970, Cornelius designed "Soul Train" as what he called "a black 'American Bandstand.'

Female tourists freed in Egypt

DATELINE: CAIRO

CAIRO - Two female American tourists were released Friday night, hours after masked gunmen kidnapped them on the road that leads to St. Catherine's Monastery, a historic landmark in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, a military official said. 
The abduction came as Egyptian demonstrators battled security forces for a second day in downtown Cairo to protest the deaths of more than 70 people killed Wednesday night in a fight between rival fans after a soccer game. 
The incident in Sinai was a rare crime in a heavily traveled area that tourists for years have considered largely safe. It represented a new blow for Egypt's beleaguered tourism industry, one of the country's main sources of revenue, which has been reeling since the popular revolt that toppled President Hosni Mubarak a year ago.
The abduction followed a string of violent crimes in Egypt recently, including the shooting of a French tourist during the armed robbery of a currency exchange shop in the Red Sea resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh last week.
A police captain in Sinai said authorities believe that the gunmen who kidnapped the American women Friday might have been members of a Bedouin tribe trying to secure the release of fellow tribesmen detained in last week's shooting.
The captain, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the kidnappers probably wanted to demand that the tribesmen be freed in return for the Americans' release.
Last month in the Sinai Peninsula, a group of 25 Chinese workers was kidnapped by Bedouin tribesmen and then freed a day later. The tribesmen had kidnapped the workers to press their demand for the release of detainees held over bombings in the peninsula between 2004 and 2006. 
Egyptians' faith in the ability of the ruling military council to maintain order was further shaken by the post-soccer match melee in Port Said on Wednesday, which left more than 70 people dead.
Protests that have erupted since the violence have resulted in more bloodshed, with at least three people killed in clashes with police overnight Thursday and on Friday.
Riot police guarding the Interior Ministry in downtown Cairo on Friday beat back waves of protesters with tear gas and rubber-coated bullets, witnesses said. Protesters blamed the police forces under the ministry's supervision for not preventing the fight at the stadium in Port Said. 
"We are here to break into this dirty, corrupted building, and we will stay here until we make it," said Mina Rizk, 23, a water company employee. "This government isn't doing anything."

Three street robberies hit Shaw community in two days

BYLINE: Martin Weil

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B04

LENGTH: 199 words

Three street robberies were reported in two days in a small section of the Shaw area of Northwest Washington this week. In the first two, the robbers had guns; in the third, a female victim was punched.  
An arrest was made in the third robbery, which occurred about 9 p.m. Wednesday in an alley near New Jersey Avenue and Fourth Street. The arrest came after  "an alert citizen" stopped someone fleeing from the scene, police said. 
The two armed robberies occurred about 11 p.m. Tuesday in the 1500 block of Fourth Street and at Third and P streets. The three incidents were reported at a time of increased concern about robberies, which police said are receiving priority attention.
Wednesday's incident provoked considerable comment on an Internet mailing list used in the  neighborhood. In that robbery, police said, the robbers hit the woman in the face, took her purse and ran. The  purse was  recovered. 
On the Internet mailing list, one person questioned the wisdom of using an alley after dark. Someone else wrote, "NO ONE should be walking in dark alleys at night." 
Several people objected: "Seriously?" one of them asked. "We should live in fear and stop living our lives?"

Character actor broughtan intensity to stage, screen

BYLINE: Matt Schudel

SECTION: METRO; Pg. C07

LENGTH: 854 words

Ben Gazzara, an actor with a quiet, brooding intensity who was featured in films and on Broadway and who starred in the 1960s television series "Run for Your Life," died Feb. 3 in New York City. He was 81.
A friend, Suzanne Mados, told the Associated Press that Mr. Gazzara was in hospice care for pancreatic cancer.  
As a young actor, Mr. Gazzara possessed a dark, controlled energy that made him an emerging stage star in the 1950s. He originated the role of Brick in Tennessee Williams's Pulitzer Prize-winning play "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" and was nominated for a Tony Award for "A Hatful of Rain," a 1955 drama in which he portrayed a war veteran addicted to drugs. 
He had a major role in the 1959 film "Anatomy of a Murder," playing an Army officer charged with a revenge killing after his wife was allegedly raped. He seemed to be an emerging star, yet he never achieved the same level of fame as two of his classmates at New York's Actors Studio, Paul Newman and Steve McQueen. 
Newman took the role of Brick when "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" was made into a film in 1958, and McQueen became a star of Hollywood action films. In what he considered an act of professional desperation, Mr. Gazzara turned to television. 
From 1965 to 1968, in "Run for Your Life," he played Paul Bryan, a lawyer with a terminal illness who was determined to pack as much adventure into his remaining days as possible. Mr. Gazzara considered the show formulaic, saying, "I could almost do the next show without reading the script," but "Run for Your Life" has retained a cult following for decades.
On the final day of shooting "Run for Your Life," Mr. Gazzara ran into actor and director John Cassavetes, who offered him a role in his new movie. The 1970 film, "Husbands," showcased Mr. Gazzara, Cassavetes and Peter Falk, who died last year, as three perplexed men trying to get over the death of a friend. 
In two other films with Cassavetes, Mr. Gazzara played a strip-club owner in "The Killing of a Chinese Bookie" (1976) and a theater director in "Opening Night" (1977). All three films became favorites with a younger generation of moviemakers, who admired the aura of cool toughness that Mr. Gazzara brought to all his roles.
"There's something so energized and unapologetically male about Ben - he's a throwback to an American archetype associated with Hemingway," Sean Penn told the Los Angeles Times in 1998.
Mr. Gazzara continued to appear on Broadway through the 1970s. He earned Tony Award nominations for his roles in 1975 in Eugene O'Neill's "Hughie" and David Scott Milton's "Duet," and he was nominated again in 1976 for a revival of Edward Albee's "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" 
He spent much of the 1980s in Italy, where he lived in a villa with his third wife and acted in Italian films. But by the 1990s, Mr. Gazzara found himself in demand by the young directors who admired his earlier work. From 1996 to 1999, Mr. Gazzara appeared in 14 movies, plus several TV movies and miniseries. 
Playwright and director David Mamet cast him as a white-collar criminal in "The Spanish Prisoner" (1997). He played a pornography mogul in the cult classic "The Big Lebowski," directed by Joel and Ethan Coen in 1998. He had the role of the angry father of an ex-convict in Vincent Gallo's "Buffalo '66" in 1998 and played a Brooklyn mob boss in Spike Lee's 1999 film, "Summer of Sam."
"He never makes anything obvious," Mamet said in 1998, "and that's the best thing you can say about an actor."
 Biagio Anthony Gazzara was born Aug. 28, 1930, in New York City. His parents were Sicilian immigrants, and he grew up speaking Italian. 
"Immigrant Italians weren't geared toward literature," he said in 1998, "so movies were our novels, and I grew up on the best: Cagney, Bogart, Cary Grant, Gable, Wallace Beery - wonderful actors. Then when I was 12, I was in a play at the Boys Club, and once I heard the applause I was sold."
He studied acting at the New School in New York and later at the Actors Studio under Lee Strasberg. Besides Newman and McQueen, his classmates included James Dean, Julie Harris and Geraldine Page.
Mr. Gazzara's first two marriages, to actresses Louise Erickson and Janice Rule, ended in divorce. 
Survivors include his wife of 29 years, Elke Stuckmann Krivat; a daughter from his marriage to Rule, Elizabeth; Krivat's daughter, Danja, whom he adopted; and a brother.
Mr. Gazzara won an Emmy Award for best supporting actor for the 2002 HBO drama "Hysterical Blindness," in which he played a widowed suitor of Gena Rowlands. From 2003 to 2005, he toured in a one-man play about baseball star and quipster Yogi Berra.
In his 2004 autobiography, "In the Moment," Mr. Gazzara admitted to occasional problems with alcohol and depression and that he'd had affairs with many women, including actresses Audrey Hepburn, Eva Gabor and Elaine Stritch. 
While making the movie "The Bridge at Remagen" in Czechoslovakia in 1968, Mr. Gazzara said he and actor Robert Vaughn befriended a Czech waitress. When Soviet forces invaded the country, they managed to smuggle her across the border by hiding her in a car.

Lifting up the fatherless

BYLINE: George F. Will

SECTION: EDITORIAL COPY; Pg. A19

LENGTH: 714 words

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

LOS ANGELES
The worst day of Sugar Bear's 55 years was one of the days - there have been many of them - when he got out of prison. In the early 1990s, in a prison where people whose sentences have ended and are being released see those whose sentences are just beginning, he saw one of his sons coming in. 
Generational recidivism is not unusual in Sugar Bear's world of fatherlessness. His son, who was convicted of selling drugs, is still incarcerated because he has not been a model prisoner. He is an apple that did not fall far from the tree. 
Sugar Bear - few call him Robert Lewis Jackson - was a precocious lawbreaker. His first arrest - "for GTA" (grand theft auto), he explains - involved a 1959 Chevy El Camino. He remembers that it was orange. He pulled off the freeway, into a gas station, and climbed down from the vehicle. The police who apprehended him there were startled. He was almost 5. 
Really. LAPD records confirm this. He drove the El Camino by sitting on a large pillow so he could see out the windshield and using a long stick to work the pedals.
Born to an unmarried, mentally ill prostitute, he acquired his interest in driving from his grandfather, who would drive around the block with Sugar Bear in his lap. Not until Sugar Bear was 25 did he learn that his grandfather was his father, too, having had a sexual relationship with Sugar Bear's mother. 
Sugar Bear grew up mostly on the streets, episodically drifting into and out of the care, such as it was, of various female relatives. He kept moving on because one relative was beaten to death in an alley, another was killed by a shotgun blast and another had Drano poured in her eyes for reasons Sugar Bear does not remember. He supported himself gathering discarded bottles for their deposits and cadging hamburgers and peanut butter sandwiches from sympathetic strangers. 
His life in the nation's entertainment capital included the exciting night of Dec. 11, 1964, when he was outside the motel when singer Sam ("You Send Me") Cooke was fatally shot. Sugar Bear was 8.
Although he has never been married, he has five children. He  has been shot only once. He says he "did juvenile time" but managed, largely because he was an athlete, to graduate from high school. After that, he was incarcerated five times, for sentences ranging from six months to 11 years. He says he was implicated in "a 187" - murder of a corrections officer - but was exonerated. Then his life's gyrations intersected with some benevolent institutions.
In 1965, immediately after the Watts riots that announced to a largely oblivious nation the volatility of some pockets of social regression, a UCLA undergraduate, Keith Phillips, moved into this devastated section of the city of angels. Now 65, Phillips is the reason why World Impact, his creation, is a presence in 13 of America's most troubled cities, such as Newark and East St. Louis. Its focus is on fatherlessness and the social pathologies that flow from it. 
This is the preoccupation of Ken Canfield, 58, a Kansas State Ph.D. who, until five years ago, headed the National Center for Fathering in Kansas City. He then moved here to help Pepperdine University develop a Center for the Family, and he now labors with World Impact living among the city's most troubled people. Canfield acquainted Sugar Bear with Psalm 68, which speaks of God as "father of the fatherless" who "setteth the solitary in families." For people like Sugar Bear, people with holes in their souls never filled by the love of fathers, Canfield says religion offers the "spiritualization of fatherhood":
"If you don't have the calm self-respect that a father gives, your passions go sideways. For a number of men, their passions become sexualized as they look for comfort and affirmation of their manhood." 
On a recent day, Sugar Bear, a burly, cheerful survivor, was wearing a windbreaker bearing the logo of the Union Rescue Mission. He works there, helping provide services to, among others, a small portion of L.A. County's 50,000 homeless, 30 percent of whom are under 35. Bailing an ocean with a thimble? Perhaps. Still, Phillips, Canfield and Sugar Bear, this unlikely American trio, exemplify a very American approach to social regeneration: one by one, from the inside out.

Holy See: Corruption allegations baseless
 The administration of the Vatican City State on Saturday categorically rejected as groundless a top prelate's accusations of corruption in the Holy See's awarding of contracts.
Last month, an Italian investigative news program reported that the prelate had unsuccessfully requested not to be transferred to Washington by Pope Benedict XVI after exposing alleged corruption that cost the Holy See millions of euros in terms of higher contract prices.
Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano was the No. 2 administrator until the pope selected him to be his envoy to the United States last fall. 
While the Vatican had previously defended Vigano's transfer to the prestigious post as proof of Benedict's "unquestionable respect and trust" in him, the written statement Saturday by the Vatican's governorship was the Holy See's first response to the corruption allegations themselves.
The Vatican's administration oversees outlays for contracts and financial investments. It administers everything from maintaining the pope's gardens to running the lucrative Vatican Museums.
In denying Vigano's allegations, it said his assertions were the "fruit of erroneous evaluations or based on unproven fears." It contended that a careful examination had determined that the "suspicions and allegations" were "completely unfounded."

9 slain in Chihuahuainclude 5 musicians
A masked man opened fire on a band playing popular norteno music Saturday in a Chihuahua city dance hall, killing five musicians and four customers, including an off-duty police officer, and injuring 10 others.
A spokesman for Chihuahua prosecutors said that the attack appeared to target members of La Quinta Banda but that the motive was not clear. The suspect fired about 40 times with a high-caliber weapon.
Norteno singers in Mexico have been targeted before, apparently for becoming involved with drug cartels, which pay them to compose narcocorridos, or ballads that glorify drug lords.
Also Saturday, federal police announced the capture of a leader of an armed gang hired by the world's most powerful drug lord, Joaquin Guzman, also known as El Chapo.
Jose Antonio Torres Marrufo, 33, is the suspected leader of Gente Nueva, an armed wing of the Sinaloa Cartel mainly based in the border city of Ciudad Juarez. Marrufo, who was captured in the city of Leon, is accused of masterminding a 2009 massacre at a rehab center where 18 people were killed.

Rebels near northern Mali town: Sporadic heavy weapons fire rang out in the northern Malian town of Kidal overnight and on Saturday, in a sign that a Tuareg-led rebellion was closing in on its most significant target to date after two weeks of fighting. Rebels combining veteran Tuareg insurgents and returnees from Libya's war last year are fighting to create an independent state in northern Mali and have gained ground in a three-pronged advance.
Death toll in Egyptian clashes reaches 12: Egyptian security forces fired tear gas from armored trucks at protesters demanding an end to military rule, as anger over a deadly soccer riot fueled a third day of clashes, with the death toll climbing to 12. The violence followed a melee and stampede after a soccer match Wednesday in the city of Port Said in which 74 people died.
U.S. general dies in Afghanistan: A 49-year-old brigadier general who died Friday in Afghanistan of apparent natural causes is probably the highest-ranking military officer to die there, according to military records. The Army announced Brig. Gen. Terence Hildner's death Saturday. Hildner had commanded the 13th Expeditionary Sustainment Command at Fort Hood, Tex., since August 2010 and left for Afghanistan in December.
China stops lawyer from meeting with Merkel: German Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed regret that Chinese police blocked a human rights lawyer from meeting her and said the Communist government should have the confidence to allow dissent. The lawyer, Mo Shaoping, said Beijing police told him Thursday he could not attend a dinner and private meeting with Merkel, who was on a three-day visit to China.
Senegal opposition signs anti-Wade pact: Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade's main rivals pledged to campaign together in an effort to force him to withdraw from an election this month. The group did not say how it would try to prevent Wade from running for a third term in the Feb. 26 vote, but their pledge, a day before campaigning officially opened, underscored rising tensions in a country that has long been an island of stability in West Africa.
Father throws baby into Rome's Tiber River:Police divers were searching the Tiber in Rome for a 16-month-old who witnesses said was thrown into the frigid river from a 30-foot-high bridge by his father around dawn. Police arrested a man, who confirmed he had thrown his son off the bridge.

Ford's Ford's red eן¬nes itself

BYLINE: by Nelson Pressley

SECTION: SUNDAY ARTS; Pg. E01

LENGTH: 1228 words

More than 750,000 people visit Ford's Theatreannually to ponder Abraham Lincoln's assassination - Booth's single shot and histrionic leap to the stage, the mortally wounded president's death across the street at a boarding house,   where Lincoln was carried after the shooting.
New dimensions to that story will be added at Ford's with the opening of the $25 million Center for Education and Leadership this month. Situated in a dramatically refurbished 10-story office building directly across the street from the fabled theater and next door to the house where he died, the center will feature expanded museum and education spaces.
The new exhibit goes beyond Lincoln's assassination and tracks his funeral, legacy and the  evolution from American liberator to pop icon, memorialized in everything from marble monuments to disguise kits and trading cards. The museum showcases such items as Booth's saddle   as well as a video that shows images of him in modern films. 
"That's the biggest change," says presidential scholar and Lincoln historian Richard Norton Smith, who helped plan the new center as well as the redesigned museum beneath the theater, which opened in 2009. "People used to be exposed to a fairly narrow slice of history, with a clear-cut ending. Now the whole package is not about endings. It literally is a story that is unfinished, and in some ways is reinterpreted by each generation."
New "centers" are the mode in Washington - the Harman Center for the Arts, the Mead Center for American Theater(a.k.a. Arena Stage) - and the ribbon-cutting of Ford's Center for Education and Leadership on Wednesday, with timed entry tours for the public beginning Feb. 21, will complete a $60 million re-visioning. The annual slate of theater productions and the cautiously preserved and displayed historic site, managed by the National Park Service, have long operated without much integration. The new campus, created by Ford's Theatre Society in coordination with the Park Service, aims for greater harmony.
"This is redefining who we are," says Ford's Director Paul R. Tetrault. The theater is creating more Lincoln connections in works as diverse as the recent musical "Parade"(about the 1915 anti-Semitic lynching in Georgia of Leo Frank) or in the current premiere "Necessary Sacrifices," dramatizing meetings between Lincoln and Frederick Douglass. (This spring, the troupe will produce the popular musical "1776" - not strictly Lincoln, but in the ballpark.)
Meantime, the historical displays have grown more theatrical. The glass facade of the new center features a giant image of Lincoln's face staring across 10th Street at the theater. Videos by the History Channel animate the museums on both sides of the street. The exhibits in the new center feature touch-screen displays and interactive elements to go with the artifacts under glass.
Tetrault credits current board Chairman Wayne R. Reynolds with broaching the idea of an expanded, more comprehensive approach. Tetrault's initial response was a wary "Hold on!" He had been hired to replace the late Frankie Hewitt, who ran Ford's as a working theater since its reopening in 1968. Tetrault's expertise was stage-related; he came to Washington after a decade as the managing director of Houston's Alley Theatre, which produced a number of notable shows on his watch.
But Tetrault says it didn't take long for him to embrace the broadened job description. "It's a more holistic way of looking at the theater," he reasons. Tetrault also recognized that Ford's was unlikely to become a national leader strictly as a theater or as a museum. But in the combination, Tetrault says, "No one does what we do."
Ford's was already renting some upper floors of 514 10th St. for administrative uses when the Theatre Society purchased the building for $9 million in 2007. Travis Wood, an exhibit designer for Split Rock Studios- the Minnesota-based design and construction firm recommended to Tetrault by Smith - describes the 1923 space as "not your typical exhibit space," says Wood, whose firm has created exhibits for museums and park visitors centers across the country. "But the location is simply perfect."
The front of the new center not only features the Lincoln-haunted glass facade, but also a sculptural tower of Lincoln-themed books rising up through the atrium and encircled by the spiral staircase that will guide visitors from floor to floor. The colorful tower features nearly 7,000 aluminum facsimiles of more than 200 titles. It's a mini-monument to the continuing cultural fascination with Honest Abe; when lighted at night, it figures to be an  arresting sight for theatergoers at intermission across the street.
Visitors will be channeled through the Peterson House to the fourth floor (via elevator) of the new center. Permanent exhibits on the assassination's aftermath and  Lincoln's legacy occupy the fourth and third floors; the second floor is being billed as the "leadership gallery," for talks and events. The first floor will be a gift shop (augmenting the pair of gift shops in Ford's itself).
Administrative and production offices are already humming in the top floors, and education gets its space in the middle. Tetrault notes that Ford's did not have an education staffer when he arrived in 2004; now it has a director and a department of five. The new classrooms and studio spaces will accommodate education programs already in place, and one floor will be equipped with high-tech facilities for "distance learning" - connecting with teachers and students across the country and potentially around the world.
Tetrault says $53 million of the planned $60 million project has been raised. The remainder is targeted for endowment; the construction is paid for. Ford's operating budget has roughly doubled during Tetrault's tenure, with the theater raising more money and selling more tickets as it expands its mission. . 
The success of the new center, Tetrault suggests, won't necessarily be measured by increased traffic.
"Throughout this whole process, we have always said, 'How do we improve the visitor experience?' " Tetrault says. "That has been our mantra. We are less interested in the number simply increasing than in the experience being better."
How to create a new experience in a city (and on a site) already rich with Lincoln was a test. Wood feels the fresh niche is the focus on the presidency, rather than on a single event. And Smith, illustrating the center's emphasis on legacy and its sense of Lincoln in Washington, points to a new History Channel film in the permanent exhibit nodding to the long appropriation of the Lincoln Memorial as America's great symbolic rallying spot.
"That itself is a metaphor for the many Lincolns," Smith says. "We need Lincoln on our side."

The gun flow to Mexico

BYLINE: Editorial Board

SECTION: EDITORIAL COPY; Pg. A18

LENGTH: 470 words

DO AMERICA'S failed gun policies contribute to the terrible violence in Mexico? Alejandro A. Poire Romero makes a compelling case that the answer is yes.
Law enforcement officials in both countries  acknowledge that 70 to 80 percent of the traceable guns seized in Mexico can be tracked to the United States. Mr. Poire Romero, a top Mexican national security and criminal justice official, offers additional evidence that the United States has been an enabler of the violence. 
 In 2005 roughly one-third of the seized guns were assault weapons. Today, according to Mr. Poire Romero, assault weapons represent 60 to 65 percent of the guns confiscated by Mexican authorities. The assault-weapons ban in the United States lapsed in 2004. 
"The significant rise in violence and the increase in the number of public officials killed in Mexico coincides with lifting of the assault weapons ban," Mr. Poire Romero said. 
Mr. Poire Romero met with Post editors and reporters on the day that Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. was again being grilled on Capitol Hillabout "Operation Fast and Furious,"during which U.S. law enforcement agents, in order to trace weapons to higher-ups in a criminal enterprise, failed to interdict guns bought by suspected straw purchasers. The operation, a version of which was undertaken during the George W. Bush administration, was deeply flawed; some 2,000 weapons are unaccounted for. Weapons traced to Fast and Furious purchases were found on the scene of the 2010 killing of a Border Patrol agent. These revelations led to the resignation of the U.S. attorney in Phoenix and reassignment of the acting director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. 
Mr. Poire Romero calls Fast and Furious "an issue of concern" for Mexico. "It's clear that we did not know and would never have approved of an operation that let guns walk into Mexico," he said, noting that the Mexican government - in addition to the U.S. Congress and the Justice Department's Office of Inspector General - is conducting its own investigation.
Yet Fast and Furious was a well-intentioned, misguided response to - and not the cause of  - the proliferation of illegal guns in Mexico. To stanch that flow, the Obama administration and Congress should heed the pleas of Mr. Poire Romero and his countrymen by reviving the assault weapons ban and closing the gun show loophole that makes it far too easy to sell weapons without a background check. The White House and lawmakers should work to enact a federal firearms trafficking statute and call for stiffer penalties for illegal straw purchases. Lawmakers also should confirm a chief for the ATF and give the beleaguered agency enough money and personnel to fulfill its mission of keeping illegal guns out of the hands of criminals on both sides of the border.

Gingrich counting on delegate math

BYLINE: Amy Gardner

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A06

LENGTH: 1725 words

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS

LAS VEGAS - In a meeting room at the Palazzo hotel here over the past week,Newt Gingrich mapped out a detailed strategy that would keep him in the presidential race all the way to the Republican convention in August.
The crux of the former House speaker's new plan is math: a complex analysis of each state's delegates, how they're awarded and how many, reasonably, Gingrich can expect to win. 
He will focus heavily on upcoming contests in Southern states, where he expects his Georgia roots and conservative rhetoric to play well. And he will step up his attacks on his leading rival, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, for being too liberal to take on President Obama in the fall. 
After a lackluster showing in the Nevada caucuses Saturday, the big question looming over the Gingrich campaign was whether he would withdraw. The Palazzo sessions provided an emphatic "no." 
Gingrich confirmed the strategy in a meeting with reporters in a nearly empty hotel ballroom here Saturday night after the Nevada results showed him losing to Romney by more than 20 percentage points. The results stood in stark contrast to Gingrich's confidence that he could go on to win.
"A vast majority of Republicans across the country are going to want an alternative to a Massachusetts moderate who has, in his career, been pro-abortion, pro-gun-control, pro-tax-increase and who ran third from the bottom in job creation in the four years he was governor," Gingrich said. "So I suspect this debate will continue for a long time. Our commitment is to find a series of victories which, by the end of the Texas primary, will leave us at parity with Governor Romney. And by that point forward, we'll see if we can't actually win the nomination."

Obstacles on many levels
The Texas primary is scheduled for April 3, and reasons to be skeptical about the new Gingrich strategy are legion. 
Gingrich fell from front-runner to a fourth-place finish in the Iowa caucuses last month at the hands of a blistering ad campaign by Romney and his allies. There's every reason to believe that those ads will continue, and that they will continue to be effective.
Gingrich has alsostruggled to raise money. Except in South Carolina, the campaign has failed to build effective field operations to compete and often comes across as disorganized and unprofessional. In Nevada last week, a spat between state and national operatives erupted into public view when miscommunication botched a planned meeting between Gingrich and Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval (R).
Gingrich's advisers say that those missteps are behind them and that the campaign is entering a more strategic phase, as evidenced by the meeting at the Palazzo. They see in Gingrich's big win in South Carolina a road map for the future, particularly in Southern states. They say they are more organized, better-funded and getting an earlier start in crucial upcoming states.
"We were outspent by $2 million and we still won by 12 points," political director Martin Baker said of South Carolina. He said that even with less money than Romney, similar victories are possible. "We just need to spend it smarter and more strategically."
Alluding to the Florida primary, in which Gingrich took a thumping, Baker said: "And we can't give Romney a four- or a six-week head start in a place where early and absentee voting is going to be 40-some-odd percent of the vote. . . . That will never happen again."
But money continues to be an issue for Gingrich. He barely appeared in public during nearly a full week in Las Vegas to concentrate on raising money. The campaign held a lunchtime fundraiser at Mundo restaurant here Thursday and said about 30 donors would come to the private event. But one of the attendees, furniture industry executive Steve Roan, said he's a conservative who hasn't made up his mind and was simply invited over from a nearby furniture show to meet the candidate.
In the Palazzo meeting room, a much-expanded team of operatives spent long days poring over spreadsheets and presentation slides detailing how convention delegates are awarded in each of the remaining states. They brainstormed new ways to go after Romney, at one point filling an easel pad with items under the heading: "different ways to call Mitt a liar."
Gingrich himself came and went. He sat in on a presentation with about two dozen donors that laid out how he can win. The Palazzo, incidentally, is owned by longtime Gingrich backer Sheldon Adelson, who himself made an appearance in the war room. Adelson and his family have given $11 million to an independent committee working on Gingrich's behalf, but recent reports that Adelson is ready to support Romney if he is the nominee could hinder Gingrich's effort to build new momentum - and his ability to raise money.
Many Republicans are skeptical that Gingrich can be competitive in so many states compressed into such a short period of time because of his fundraising and organizational disadvantages.
Romney campaign spokesman Andrea Saul said: "He has a right to continue on as a candidate, but the walls will start closing in on him. He's expecting some wins next month, but that might be hard to pull off after suffering a string of losses. You don't win by losing."

The discipline question
One former associate, Rich Galen, said Gingrich has another hurdle entirely: finding the discipline to follow his own plan. "I've been in those meetings and I've been with the flip charts and I've been with the whiteboards, and there's generally a lot of positive energy that's generated and a lot of brain power that goes into those things," Galen said. "The problem is that Newt tends not to follow whatever the plan is for literally more than a few hours before he comes up with a better plan and goes off in a different direction."
Throughout the campaign, Gingrich has been proud to be his own senior strategist. He regularly proclaims the day his team of consultants quit last spring as one of the best of his campaign. He sends and receives hundreds of BlackBerry messages a day (from 5 a.m. to 12:15 a.m., according to his spokesman, R.C. Hammond). He relies heavily on an old friend in Florida who sends him dozens of news articles each day on topics that Gingrich has requested to inform his message and his strategy. And much of the decision-making happens in his head: Last week in Florida, when asked what Gingrich's strategy in Nevada would be, Hammond replied, "Newt hasn't started thinking about Nevada yet."
But as the Las Vegas war room makes clear, there is now more of a team than Gingrich has let on, with new hires coming on board weekly, including local teams in such upcoming states as Arizona, Ohio and Texas. Baker, the political director, started in mid-December. A TV ad scriptwriter has joined the team, as have two pollsters and several general strategists. At the Palazzo, all of them gathered in a single room for the first time.

Depending on the South
The winning candidate needs 1,144 delegates to claim the nomination. The process by which they're awarded varies widely. In some states, for instance, delegates are won according to primary results at the congressional district level. Members of Gingrich's team have studied the convoluted rules, and they believe they can win delegate-rich states but also collect delegates in states where Romney is expected to win but where delegates are awarded proportionally.
A central assumption of the victory plan is a strong showing in Southern states. According to two operatives close to Gingrich who requested anonymity to speak freely about internal discussions, the campaign will focus heavily on Georgia and Tennessee, which vote on Super Tuesday, March 6, and count for 76 and 55 delegates, respectively. They will also target Alabama (47), Mississippi (37), Missouri (52) and Louisiana (43), which vote later in the month. To put those numbers in perspective, consider that Romney won just 50 delegates in Florida's winner-take-all primary, and he has won a total of 74, compared with Gingrich's 26.
Gingrich's Georgia roots give him an advantage over Romney in those states, the advisers say, and the evidence comes not only from his big win in South Carolina but also from the results in Florida, where Gingrich bested Romney in the Panhandle, the most "Southern" and therefore conservative part of the state, they said. Gingrich also has three surrogates who will begin campaigning heavily this month: former senator and presidential contender Fred Thompson of Tennessee, former congressman J.C. Watts of Oklahoma and Texas Gov. Rick Perry. All three have significant followings among conservative voters, particularly evangelicals, whose votes could be crucial in the South.
Even in states such as Massachusetts and Vermont, which Romney is expected to win, delegates will be awarded proportionally, and Gingrich plans to win delegates, one by one, by using targeted phone lists and targeted mail and focusing on more conservative regions.
A central weakness of Gingrich's strategy, however, is that even if it all goes like clockwork, he would still essentially be tied with Romney by April - when a series of winner-take-all contests is expected to favor Romney's superior funding and organization.

A gap in Virginia
One dark spot on that plan is Virginia, which also votes on Super Tuesday, but where Gingrich failed to collect the necessary signatures to get on the ballot. In a state with a deeply conservative Republican electorate, where Gingrich was widely expected to be competitive, it was a huge blow. 
"That's the one state where we frankly messed up in," Gingrich said at his news conference Saturday. "I've been pretty honest about that. We did the wrong thing. We hired the wrong person."
Gingrich is also focused on early voting - making a stop this week in Ohio, where early voting is set to begin in advance of Super Tuesday.
His strategists are also lobbying two networks - Fox News and ABC - to add debates to the schedule between now and March. At his news conference Saturday, Gingrich said of Romney: "I look forward very much to opportunities to debate him." It is not lost on the campaign that Gingrich's success this cycle has depended largely on his strong debate performances, but none are scheduled for most of February, and that is widely viewed as a disadvantage for him.

DATELINE: INDIANAPOLIS

INDIANAPOLIS - There was no perfect season on the line this time, but the New York Giants did it again toTom Brady, Bill Belichick and the New England Patriots. Quarterback Eli Manningengineered the big drive in crunch time when the Giants needed it and New York beat the Patriots, 21-17, on Sunday night at Lucas Oil Stadium in another down-to-the-wire Super Bowl between these rivals.
A season that began with Manning declaring himself an elite quarterback ended with him backing up that proclamation with his second Super Bowl most valuable player performance.
"I just know we're world champions tonight," Manning said, "and that's what I'm most proud of." 
After crafting six fourth-quarter, game-winning drives during the regular season, five of them to cap fourth-quarter comebacks, Manning pulled off that feat again in another nerve-rattling Super Bowl. The Giants, trailing by two points, drove 88 yards to the winning touchdown on a six-yard run bytailback Ahmad Bradshaw with 57 seconds left.
It was one of the oddest game-winning touchdowns in Super Bowl history. The Patriots, trying to preserve their final timeout and precious seconds on the clock for their offense, allowed Bradshaw to score. Bradshaw, realizing that, attempted to stop just shy of the goal line but tumbled into the end zone.
"We didn't talk about it" before the play, Bradshaw said. "Eli was handing me the ball and telling me not to score. I tried to tap myself down, declare myself down, but my momentum carried me into the end zone. It was a strange play."
Said Manning: "It's a mistake by me. I had a feeling they might do that. I should have told him [before the play] not to score."
The strategy didn't work. The Giants failed on a two-point conversion attempt and the  Patriots took over at their 20-yard line for a last-gasp drive. Brady kept them alive with a fourth-and-16 completion, and New England reached its 49-yard line. But Brady's desperation heave into the distant end zone as time expired was tipped and fell incomplete beyond the outstretched hands of Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski.
"We just came up a little bit short," Brady said. "I think we had a couple of missed opportunities out there. Every guy in the locker room wishes he could have done a little bit more."
Belichick acknowledged instructing his defense to let the Giants score, saying he didn't want the clock to wind down for a short-range Giants field goal that almost certainly would have been successful. His players backed their coach.
"Bill has always put us in the best position to succeed," Patriots safety James Ihedigbo said. "No matter what, we trust him. He wanted to put the ball in Tom's hands. That's the decision he made and we support him."
Brady said: "I like it. . . . We had a chance to win there at the end. We just didn't do it."
The Giants became the first team to win a Super Bowl after going 9-7 in the regular season. They won six straight games, four of them in the postseason, after their record dropped to 7-7.
"We've won so many games like this," Giants Coach Tom Coughlin said.
Manning had a touchdown pass and completed 30 of 40 passes for 296 yards. He didn't throw an interception as he secured his second Super Bowl triumph over the Patriots in tandem with Coughlin.http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/redskins/super-bowl-2012-patriots-giants-return-with-rosters-retooled-around-coaches-quarterbacks/2012/02/03/gIQApY2FqQ_story.html Manning also was the MVP four years ago when the Giants denied the Patriots what would have been the first 19-0 season in NFL history.
"This isn't about one person," Manning said. "This about a team coming together, getting this win. I'm just proud of our guys, proud of the team and how we fought all year."
The Giants jumped to an early 9-0 lead on a safety, courtesy of an intentional-grounding penalty on Brady in the end zone, and a touchdown pass from Manning to wide receiver Victor Cruz.  But the Patriots scored 17 straight points as Brady threw touchdown passes to running back Danny Woodhead and tight end Aaron Hernandez, at one point completing 16 straight passes, to break the mark of 13 set by Hall of Fame quarterback Joe Montana.
Brady threw an interception as he went 27 for 41 for 276 yards. He was denied in his bid to match the record of four Super Bowl victories for a quarterback by Montana, his boyhood hero, and Terry Bradshaw. Belichick failed in his attempt to tie Chuck Noll for the most Super Bowl triumphs by a coach with four.
After two Lawrence Tynesfield goals, the Patriots led 17-15 entering the fourth quarter. But Brady threw his lone interception to  Giants linebacker Chase Blackburn, who outleaped an injured Gronkowski for the ball, and it was Manning who made the necessary plays down the stretch. Gronkowski had only two catches for the Patriots as he played on an injured ankle.
On another critical play with time running down and Patriots looking to pad their lead,  the usually sure-handed Wes Welker, who led the NFL in receptions this year, could not come up with a difficult pass from Brady.
"It hurts to get that close and fall short," Patriots guard Logan Mankins said.
The Giants dominated in the early going, running 19 of the game's first 20 plays. Manning completed his first nine passes, the best start to a game in Super Bowl history.
Brady gave the Giants the lead when he released a throw from his own end zone just before being hit by defensive end Justin Tuck, and was called for intentional grounding when the pass landed on the turf deep down the middle of the field with no receiver nearby. The Giants took the resulting free kick by the Patriots and drove to the game's first touchdown on Manning's two-yard pass to Cruz.
The Patriots finally started moving on offense but had to settle for a 29-yard field goal by kicker Stephen Gostkowski. The New England defense toughened in the second quarter and Brady found his rhythm, completing his final 11 first-half passes. He was 10 for 10 as the Patriots went 96 yards, matching the longest drive in Super Bowl history, en route to a touchdown eight seconds before halftime on Brady's four-yard pass to Woodhead.
Brady was 5 for 5 on the Patriots' opening second-half drive. His 16th straight completion was a 12-yard touchdown strike to Hernandez. The Giants replied with a pair of field goals by Tynes later in the third quarter.

2 Prince George'sofficers suspended
Two Prince George's County police officers have been suspended while investigators continue looking into an incident in which one officer discharged his gun, county police said Monday.
The police department said in a news release that videotape evidence "does not support" the initial account of the incident, which occurred Friday night in the Brentwood area.
In a statement Saturday, police said the officer fired during a confrontation with someone who "began to reach for" the officer's gun. No one was struck. The confrontation followed a chase from a store where police thought a robbery was about to be committed, the Saturday statement said. 
In their initial account, police said Ryan Keith Dorm, 19, of Cottage City was charged with attempted second-degree assault and attempt to disarm a law enforcement officer. They are now asking that the charges be amended.

Shooting victim seeks help at center
A man was shot Monday morning and then went into the lobby of the Patricia R. Harris Education Center for help, causing the building to go on lockdown, D.C. police and fire officials said.
The man was conscious and breathing, the officials said. The shooting did not occur inside the building, but police do not know yet where the shooting took place.
The center, on Livingston Road SE, is now used as a vocational education facility run by the University of the District of Columbia.

VIRGINIA

House kills study on solitary confinement
The Republican-controlled House of Delegates killed a bill that would have required Virginia to study ways to limit the use of solitary confinement in state prisons, especially of mentally ill inmates.
 Dels. Patrick A. Hope (D-Arlington) and Charniele Herring (D-Alexandria) and Sen. Adam P. Ebbin (D-Alexandria) proposed the bill after visiting state prisons in the fall, including Red Onion in Southwest Virginia, to examine how their most violent inmates are treated.
The House killed the bill in its Rules Committee. A similar bill in the Senate has yet to be heard, but it's unlikely that the House would change its position.
Virginia, one of 44 states that use solitary confinement, has 1,800 people in isolation, a sizable share of the estimated 25,000 people in solitary in the nation's state and federal prisons.

Trial date is set in tardiness case
Amy and Mark Denicore are headed to trial to defend themselves against charges that they violated Virginia law by making their kids late to elementary school too often.
The Loudoun County couple was arraigned Monday morning in juvenile and domestic relations court. Judge Pamela L. Brooks set a trial date of March 14.
The Denicores are each charged with three Class 3 misdemeanors; a conviction on each carries a maximum fine of $500. Their three children, ages 6, 7 and 9, have been late to school almost 30 times since September. Most of their tardies were three minutes or less.
Their case has sparked debate about whether the school system is overreacting to a minor offense or rightly clamping down on a habit that's disruptive to teachers and other students.

Man's DNA doesn't match attacker's
The DNA of a man convicted of raping a College of William and Mary student in 1978 does not match that of her attacker, a University of Virginia School of Law program said Monday.
The Innocence Project is working to have the conviction of Bennett Barbour, 56, of Williamsburg overturned, according to a news release.
Barbour was found guilty of the rape based on the victim's eyewitness identification.
He was sentenced to 18 years  but was paroled after serving five years because other evidence came to light casting doubt on his conviction, according to the Innocence Project. 
Barbour's DNA sample is among about 1,000 from crimes dating to the 1970s that formerVirginia governor Mark Warner (D) ordered tested.
The Virginia attorney general's office has ordered a second DNA test to verify that Barbour's DNA does not match the attacker's.

Insurgents claim attacks on Shiites
An al-Qaeda-affiliated group has asserted responsibility for the two deadliest attacks on Shiites in Iraq since the U.S. military completed its withdrawal in December, underlining an escalating sectarian security and political crisis that threatens to drive the country toward civil war.
A statement Monday by theIslamic State of Iraq insurgent group said that "Sunni heroes of heroes" infiltrated Shiite processions with explosive vests, killing scores of "nonbelievers and Iranian agents" during Arbaeen, one of the most sacred times for Shiite Muslims. 
The bloodiest of the Arbaeen attacks the group claimed was the Jan. 5 wave of apparently coordinated bombings in Baghdad and outside the southern city of Nasiriyah that killed 78 people.  The second came nine days later in a blast near the southern city of Basra. At least 53 pilgrims were killed.

Attacker defendsdeadly rampage
Survivors and relatives of those killed in a Norwegian mass-murder rampage wept and ridiculed the smiling attacker in court Monday as he defended his acts by issuing a tirade against immigration.
Anders Behring Breivik, who killed 77 people, provoked tears and laughter in the packed court as he gave a far-right salute and said he had carried out the massacre to prevent his country's cultural destruction.  He told the court: "The attacks on the government headquarters were preventive attacks on traitors to the nation, people committing or planning to commit cultural destruction, including destruction of Norwegian culture and Norwegian ethnicity."
Despite pleading not guilty, Breivik has admitted detonating a fertilizer bomb that killed eight people at a government building in Oslo in July and hours later gunning down participants at an island summer camp for Labor Party youths, killing 69.
Breivik, whose trial is set for April, used Monday's routine custody hearing to demand his release on the grounds that "people subjected to genocide" may legally defend themselves.

Netanyahu: Stop 'chitchat' about Iran
An Israeli official says the country's prime minister has told his cabinet to quit the "chitchat" about Iran.
Israeli political and military leaders have been increasingly candid recently on the subject of possible Israeli action against the Iranian nuclear program.
Israel considers Iran to be its most dangerous enemy and has vowed to prevent it from obtaining a nuclear weapon.
The official said Monday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his cabinet to keep quiet, saying the talk was harming Israeli interests. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was discussing a closed meeting.
Netanyahu himself has often commented about keeping all options on the table in dealing with Iran.

Romania's government collapses after protests: Romania's government collapsed Monday following weeks of protests against austerity measures, the latest debt-stricken government in Europe to fall in the face of rising public anger over biting cuts. Emil Boc, who had been prime minister since 2008, said he was resigning "to defuse political and social tension" and to make way for a new government.

Senate votes to lift limit on handgun purchases

The _blankVirginia Senatevoted Monday to lift the state's one-per-month limit on handgun purchases, eliminating a 19-year-old cap that critics called outdated but gun-control activists credited with tamping down weapons trafficking. 
The GOP-controlled Senate voted 21 to 19 to do away with the purchase limit, just days after the House passed its version of the bill. Gov. Robert F. McDonnell (R), who voted for the cap as a delegate but vowed to lift it as a gubernatorial candidate, has indicated that he will sign the legislation.
Pro-gun lawmakers have tried for years to end handgun purchase limits, imposed in 1993 under Democratic governor L. Douglas Wilder to curb gun trafficking.
"It's a banner day for gun owners," said Robert Sadtler, a gun-rights activist. "This law never really accomplished what it claimed to. . . . It's way overdue for repeal."
Sen. Janet D. Howell (D-Fairfax) warned that lifting the cap would earn the commonwealth a new slogan to go along with "Virginia is for lovers": "Virginia, gun-runners' paradise."
"I just don't know what good could possibly come of this," said Senate Minority Leader Richard L. Saslaw (D-Fairfax).
Senate Majority Leader Thomas K. Norment Jr. (R-James City) joined the mostly Democratic opposition to lifting the cap. But he also noted that Virginia had "considerably tightened our background checks" since it was put into place.
Two Democrats joined Republicans to eliminate the cap: former gubernatorial candidate R. Creigh Deeds (Bath) and John S. Edwards (Roanoke).
Bills to remove the limit have passed the Republican-dominated House before. But they always died in the Senate when Democrats and moderate Republicans controlled the upper chamber.
After _blanktaking control of the evenly divided chamberlast month, a more conservative group of GOP senators _blankgot the gun bill out of committeeand to a full floor vote.
Eliminating the one-gun-per-month limit has been a priority of Richmond's gun lobby, which has had mixed success so far this _blankGeneral Assembly session.
Last month, a Senate panel killed a bill that would have done away with state background checks and another that would have prevented colleges from banning firearms on campus. A bill to allow college professors to carry concealed weapons on campus died in a House subcommittee vote Monday, but a bill that would allow guns in non-secured areas of airport terminals advanced to the full House panel. The House passed a bill Thursday to allow public employees to store firearms and ammunition in personal cars parked at workplaces, including child-care centers, recreation centers and parks run by localities.

Fantastic voyage

BYLINE: Dave Sheinin

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. D01

LENGTH: 1700 words

By now, some 20,000 miles into this audacious odyssey, nearly everything onboard Matt Rutherford's boat is either flat-out busted, rotted through, waterlogged beyond repair or otherwise reduced to ballast. If the insidious Arctic fog didn't do the job, seeping into every crevice of the 27-foot sailboat and all its humble contents, then the rogue waves near Cape Horn surely did.  
He's down to one pair of pants, the rest having fallen victim to a black mold infestation that also cost him every last book he had carried on board, way back in June 2011, when he set out from Annapolis on this half-crazy mission to circumnavigate the Americas alone and non-stop.
The four solar panels he had hooked up to power his electronics? Busted, one by one. The canvas dodger, which protects the cabin from waves and spray? Shredded by a huge wave in the Bering Sea. His freighter radar, which alerts him to any huge ships bearing down on his little speck-in-the-ocean of a sailboat? Destroyed. His Kindle reader? Kaput. 
His shotgun is half-rusted and may or may not be capable of shooting, but that's not important anymore. The shotgun was for one purpose: fending off polar bears in the Northwest Passage, in the event he became iced in, marooned until the following summer's thaw. But that leg of the journey was some six months, 15,000 miles and one continent ago.   
"At this point," Rutherford said of the shotgun, "it's just a clump of metal."
His satellite phone still works, and he can send and receive e-mail through his GPS service - which is how he is able to stay connected with a handful of Annapolis-based friends who provide support. It is also how it was that he came to be speaking to a reporter recently while pointed north, some 2,000 miles east of Argentina. Now roughly parallel to the southern tip of Brazil, he is within 5,000 miles of completing his journey, with a mid-April return to Annapolis. (You can follow his voyage, in map and blog form, at solotheamericas.org.)
"It does get incredibly lonely," he said during an interview conducted partly by e-mail and partly by satellite phone. "Lonely to the point where anything living is comforting. A bird, a fish, even a barnacle. I think I'm beyond lonely."
It is difficult to convey fully the audacity of what Rutherford is attempting to do: sailing some 25,000 miles, through some of the Earth's most treacherous ocean, on a 36-year-old Albin Vega boat (which he christened the Saint Brendan, in honor of a sixth-century explorer) best suited to weekend sailors who never venture beyond Tilghman Island on the Eastern Shore of the Chesapeake. Already, the Scott Polar Institute in Cambridge, England, has recognized him as the first person in recorded history to make it through the fabled Northwest Passage alone and non-stop on such a small sailboat.
But for the sake of context, allow Herb McCormick to tell you how incredible Rutherford's odyssey is. In 2009-10, McCormick, a veteran sailor and a senior editor at Cruising World magazine, completed the same journey (though he did it in a clockwise direction, while Rutherford is going counterclockwise) - and it was grueling and mind-numbing and treacherous, testing both his skills and his fortitude on a daily basis.
"There were times when I shook my head and said, 'What am I doing?' " McCormick said.
McCormick, however, made his journey around the Americas on a 64-foot steel boat loaded with wine and steaks and a huge reserve of diesel for motoring through the ice of the Northwest Passage and the windless expanses near the equator. 
Oh, and McCormick was part of a four-man crew, all of whom were experienced sailors - and none of whom ever had to take a 10-hour shift at the helm, for example, dodging icebergs in the fog of Baffin Bay off the coast of Greenland while clocking eight knots, as Rutherford did.
They didn't sleep nightly in a damp sleeping bag, or lay their heads on a damp, moldy pillow, as Rutherford does. They didn't smash their head into the ceiling if they tried to stand up in their cabin. They didn't have to pump a manual desalinator for 30 minutes every time they wanted a cup of water. They almost certainly didn't go walking around their boat wearing a paintball mask to do the job of a more suitable piece of waterproof headgear that they couldn't afford.
"What Matt is trying to do, I'm absolutely blown away by it," McCormick said. "He's doing this in a boat that, frankly, I'd be scared to sail from Newport to Bermuda. I'm in awe of the guy. This is such a mammoth undertaking, and to do it without stopping - alone - is mind-boggling. 
"It's almost teetering on the edge of blood-insanity, frankly. When I heard what he was trying to do, I thought it was a suicide mission. I was fearful for him."

A quest for self-knowledge
What, then, would compel a 30-year-old Ohio native with a passion for the Cleveland Browns and the history of exploration to climb aboard an old sailboat, loaded with hand-me-down equipment and freeze-dried food, and embark on a mission that more experienced and practical sailors equate to suicide?
The simple answer is charity. Rutherford concocted his idea as a way to raise money for Chesapeake Region Accessible Boating (CRAB), an Annapolis-based organization that aims to provide sailing opportunities for physically and/or developmentally disabled persons. While Rutherford is about 80 percent done with his voyage, he is only about 10 percent of the way to his fundraising goal of $250,000 for CRAB's projects.
But as one would expect, there is a larger mission at work here, a quest for self-knowledge and inner peace that Rutherford hasn't always been able to find on dry land. He was born and raised, he says, in a cult, before becoming "angry and confused" as a youth and taking to street life, spending much of his teens going in and out of juvenile detention centers.
The life of adventure that he chose in his 20s as a means of escape has led him, among other places, to a solo bicycle journey across Southeast Asia and a pair of trans-Atlantic sails. His latest adventure makes those seem like child's play.
"Ultimately," he said, "I am trying to accomplish something that is greater than myself."
The payoff, when it chooses to reveal itself, is the occasional brush with nature's overwhelming glory: seals, whales, walruses, narwhals, great albatrosses, penguins. In the Arctic (before his camera broke), he snapped pictures of icebergs the size of office buildings. One recent night, in the austral summer just on this side of Cape Horn, he marveled at the magnificence of the stars, the Milky Way appearing like a thick cloud.
"I have a strong bond with the ocean," he said. "I feel like I can understand it, and in some ways it understands me."
Twice, he has had face-to-face contact with humans, by necessity as opposed to chance. The first was just two weeks in, when his desalinator broke off the coast of Newfoundland, nearly ending the journey. But Simon Edwards, Rutherford's friend and primary lifeline to the civilized world, found someone in Newfoundland willing to deliver Rutherford a replacement, along with a bottle of Newfoundland rum called Screech.
The second human contact was a resupply on the other side of the Northwest Passage, near Dutch Harbor, Alaska, when he found himself in need of a new inverter, for charging his electronics. A boat tied off to his and handed over a replacement inverter, a hot pizza, a stack of newspapers, a bottle of scotch, a Virginia ham, some vegetables and 25 gallons of diesel. Rutherford, meantime, handed over a flash drive containing his iceberg pictures, which were subsequently uploaded to his blog.
In both cases, he never dropped anchor, and no one came aboard his boat, thus preserving the nonstop, solo designation of the journey. Still, in a blog post detailing the resupply, Rutherford lamented his concession to reality - noting that his idol, the Irish explorer Ernest Shackleton, never had such creature comforts delivered to his own boat.
"When I left on this trip, I wanted to suffer like [Shackleton] suffered," Rutherford wrote. "I felt that the resupply was infringing on my suffering." 
Ultimately, though, he concluded, "There is no reason to make this trip harder than it already is." He ended the blog post, as he has each one, with the Shackleton family motto: Fortitudine Vincimus, or "by endurance we conquer."

Contemplating life on land
The hardest parts of the voyage are over now - the treacherous ice of the Northwest Passage, the typhoons blowing off Japan and across the north Pacific, the unpredictable weather and currents around Cape Horn - but Rutherford is hardly home free. McCormick noted the worst weather his crew encountered during their entire journey came around North Carolina's Cape Hatteras.
"The worst night of our entire trip. . . . We got absolutely creamed off Cape Hatteras," McCormick said. "It's called the Graveyard of the North Atlantic for good reason." Assuming Rutherford makes it, McCormick believes he should be listed among names such as Joshua Slocum, the first man to sail solo around the world; Robin Knox-Johnston, the first to do so non-stop; and Sir Francis Chichester, the first to do so by the southern "clipper route."
"His name belongs in the annals of history, alongside those men," he said.
For Rutherford, the most ecstatic and most terrifying parts of the trip will be the same one - the moment at Annapolis's City Dock when he sets foot on dry land again, for the first time in some 10 months. There is some sort of reception planned - his friends and benefactors won't tell Rutherford exactly what, and he doesn't really want to know. People will be looking at him. He might feel as if he should say something.
As much as he craves a hot shower, a cold beer and the company of "the ladies," as he likes to say, there is plenty about life at sea that is simply easier than life on land.
"I have mixed feelings about being on land again," he said. "I know I have to go - I'm going to need toilet paper, and I could use a drink. But I'm broke on land. I live on a really small boat. I struggle on land with a lot of things. 
"I guess you just trade one struggle for another."

In it for the long haul

BYLINE: Annys Shin

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B01

For more than four decades, Maurice Queen has held one of the most coveted jobs in the District government.
He's not deputy mayor or chief technology officer. He doesn't even have a desk.
He's a trash collector. And in a city where good paying jobs are hard to come by for those without college degrees, that makes Queen and his colleagues an object of envy.
"It is a great job," said Queen, who's 64 and has no immediate plans to retire, "and a lot of people would love to have it." 
A spot on the back of a garbage truck has become a lofty perch, especially during an economic downturn that has hit other blue-collar jobs in construction, manufacturing and transportation hard. Online applications for city jobs are up 28 percent since 2008, and a sanitation job is one of the hardest to get. 
The 241 men and women who work along 55 routes and collect nearly 100,000 tons of trash and recycling each year, know they're fortunate. The work can be back-breaking and potentially hazardous. Workers have run across everything from skinned deer remains to phosphoric acid. But the pay - an average salary of $36,000 a year, plus health and other benefits -  is good, and the hours are even better. As long as the weather and traffic cooperate, sanitation workers who start work at 6:30 a.m. can be done by the time most desk jockeys are pondering their second cup of coffee.
"You can be finished by 10, 11 o'clock in the morning. That right there is the big draw," said Barry Nix, who has been a District sanitation worker for 25 years. "You can get home to see your kids."
Or get a second job. Queen, for example, is known as "The Pony Man" because he runs a horse-rental business on the side.
Twenty-plus-year tenures are commonplace inside the Department of Public Works' Solid Waste Division. (In Montgomery, Fairfax and other places outside the city, garbage collectors often work for private contractors, not the county.) Most D.C. employees with that many years on the job are drivers or supervisors. Getting in the door means landing an entry-level "technician" position, riding on the outside of the truck. And there are only a few openings a year. 
With 42 years on the job, Queen is the Cal Ripken of District garbage collectors. There are guys who have worked in waste collection longer, but not just as a technician the way Queen has. 
"I enjoy throwing trash," said Queen, a bearded, barrel-chested former professional bull rider who lives in Hyattsville. "It keeps you active. And I'm an outdoor person."

Relentless pace
Queen has been around so long that he predates the arrival of the Supercan and trash compactor trucks. When he started, there were five men on a truck: a driver, two in rear of the vehicle and two more in the alley hoisting cans. Without a compactor, the truck filled up quickly, and it could take five or six loads to finish one route.
"Some of these guys today wouldn't last," Queen said.
Hauling trash nowadays resembles assembly line work. The 85-gallon Supercans roll onto a lift in the back of the truck, then tilt open with the pull of a lever.
On a recent weekday, Nix, 48, and Lorenzo Bland, 46, hustle through alleys in the Palisades, rolling one can after another onto the lifts. Some alleys that they pass through off MacArthur Boulevard are nicer than many streets in the District. There are landscaped yards, trellised barbecue pits, and playhouses the size of studio apartments. But Bland and Nix don't do much sightseeing. They can't if they want to keep up with the truck. The pace is relentless.
There are temptations. Televisions, laptops, leather chairs. The official agency policy prohibits workers from taking home discarded items. But workers sometimes still do, discreetly. 
Trash collectors are also not allowed to accept tips and gifts, which can lead to awkward interactions with grateful residents such as the woman who approached Bland and Nix's truck as it idled behind a townhouse development off of Arizona Avenue NW. She tried to hand an envelope to driver and crew chief, Tavis Clinton, 34. It takes some doing before she gives up, gets into her red Prius, and drives off.
Other parts of town are less hospitable. A crew might run into anything from unchained Rottweilers, drug dealers, or gun shots.
"You have a lot of nefarious actions that go on in alleys," said James E. Ivey, president of AFSCME District Council 20, which represents the District's sanitation workers.
A sanitation technician was killed on the job in October, as he was starting his shift at the DPW yard on W Street NE. Larry Hutchins, 51, a tech for 24 years, was shot and killed when an unidentified man walked into the yardand opened fire. Another worker was also wounded. The case remains unsolved.
The Palisades route is mercifully free of stray bullets. The trash also tends to be "neater" - more Sur La Table boxes, and fewer hypodermic needles. It has its downsides, namely being furthest from the Fort Totten Trash Transfer Station. The longer the ride to the dump, the longer it takes to finish the route.
The denizens of Palisades are also quick to pick up the phone if Supercans aren't neatly put away or a truck doesn't pull up as quickly as expected. 

'The Pony Man'
Once someone calls, the person most likely to appear by their Supercan is Queen, who now operates a "complaint truck," a diminutive version of the regular garbage packer that responds to reports of missed collections. On a recent Monday, Queen and two other technicians were responsible for all of Ward 3, "where the aristocrats live," as he put it.
Queen headed to Barnaby Woods, cranking the heat and the radio, which he keeps on Praise 104.1. He wore a blue sweater over a button down shirt, and an orange scarf tied around his neck. His black shoes were shined. He said some of the guys make fun of him for not dressing down more.
Queen was born and raised in Southeast Washington, but he fell in love with horses after visiting a stable.
By the early 1980s, he was hauling trash by day, and on the weekends competing on the rodeo circuit in Oklahoma and Texas. One of his mentors was Charles Sampson, another black bull rider, who grew up in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles and was later inducted into the Pro Rodeo Hall of Fame.
Whenever Queen would return home after a rodeo, his wife would ask him, "Have you had enough?" Seven years later, after a few broken bones, bruised ribs, and a scar between his eyes where a bull's hoof once landed, he answered, "Yes." 
He now spends his weekends running a business renting out horses for birthday parties, weddings, and funerals.
By the time Queen returned to the yard, it was 2:30 p.m. The other crews were long gone. He looked over his truck one last time to make sure it would be ready when he returned at 6:30 a.m. Then he headed home.

'The River,' dragging out all the horror cliches

BYLINE: Hank Stuever

SECTION: STYLE; Pg. C05

LENGTH: 499 words

There's paranormal, and then there's para-puhleeez. The line between those two can be quite fine, especially when results vary from viewer to viewer. 
"The River," which premieres on ABC on Tuesday night, leaps back and forth from frightening to ridiculous so often that it might as well be performing double-Dutch jump rope. It's a drama about a film crew that goes in search of missing nature/adventure TV show host Dr. Emmet Cole (Bruce Greenwood), who was last seen shooting episodes of his docu-series, "The Undiscovered Country," in remote tributaries of the Amazon River. He was presumed dead - until his GPS locator started beeping out a distress signal.  
Led by Cole's obsessive wife (Leslie Hope) and his angry, estranged son (the Kevin Bacon-esque Joe Anderson), the crew diverts off the Amazon and into the dreaded "Boiuna," a serpentine maze of spooky waterways. The goal is to make a new reality show about the family's hunt for the celebrity explorer.
Most of the crew wear that "Alien" look of doomed auxiliary characters, yet they continue deep into the Boiuna, even as the requisite clairvoyant child (Paulina Gaitan) begs everyone to turn the heck around. Hopes are raised when they locate the Magus, Dr. Cole's trusty ship, moored in a viney tangle. Lured by a banging sound from a below-decks panic room, they unwittingly open the door and set free a bloodsucking ghost known as a "corpo seco." Now they're sorry.
Now all of us are. Like many shows of late, "The River" hopes to nab an audience that craves action and terror impossibly layered with infinite, unknowable mysteries. Although it has some nice moves and the occasional tense moment, the show's visual allure quickly leads to aggravation.
Executive-produced by Stev- y'know, I've typed the words "executive-produced by Steven Spielberg" so many times in TV reviews over the past year that the keyboard practically auto-finishes the phrase. Those words have become meaningless, at best indicating a certain predictability.
In this case, everything's recycled. "The River" borrows from Joseph Conrad's "Heart of Darkness," "The Thing," "The Blair Witch Project," "The Serpent and the Rainbow," Steve Irwin (a.k.a. the Crocodile Hunter, who met his demise in a stingray encounter in 2006) and even, weirdly, "The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou."
Co-produced by the creator of the successful "Paranormal Activity" films, "The River's" narrative is built around the "found footage" conceit, in that everything the viewer sees has been (or is being) videotaped by the crew or captured by security cams. Although this style has provided chilling verisimilitude in the past (the "Paranormal Activity" films can be terrifically unsettling), it also becomes a lazy gimmick. 
Even as they're being chased by bloodsucking jungle phantoms, the crew keeps filming. One of them gets his head ripped off, but sadly for us, his camera remains in good working order.

Dierks Bentley, on a role with 'Home'

BYLINE: Chris Richards

SECTION: STYLE; Pg. C01

LENGTH: 950 words

If you've ever looked down your nose at country music, it might be because so many artists seem to suffer some form of multiple-personality disorder. 
To wit: Dierks Bentley's new album, "Home," finds him cast as lover man, party bro, proud patriot, dedicated dad. Throughout his career, he has gone from bar-crawling lothario to devoted husband from one song to the next. 
But so what? Like an actor playing a role, great country singers inhabit their songs and make them sound like they're living it all right before your ears. When it works, it feels Oscar-worthy. When it doesn't, it feels suspect, like a politician doling out sweet nothings on the stump.  
Dierks Bentley is a great country singer. 
"Home," out Tuesday, is his seventh and most assured album, with the 36-year-old Arizona native singing from an array of vantage points with a sure-footedness that wasn't always totally there. He's penned a few goofy party anthems over the years, but with the indelible gallop of "Am I the Only One," you can finally taste the beer. Elsewhere, he's a homesick family man, a nine-to-fiver pining for escape and a jilted lover in denial.
Bentley says it's no act. "I've been the guy who had the broken heart where your hair falls out in the shower," he says. "With country music, you have to be a little older and have gone through life. I can hear great singers who have never had their heart broken. I can hear it right away."
Lounging on his tour bus outside the Recher Theatre in Towson, Md., on Super Bowl Sunday afternoon, Bentley is on the road promoting an album that has to please a wide swath of fans without sacrificing conviction. After 2010's "Up on the Ridge," Bentley's stellar, bluegrass-y left turn of a record, "Home" steers things back toward the pop charts. Unlike most of Bentley's previous albums, this one finds the singer doing what so many of his peers do - tapping into Music Row. 
Nashville songwriters supply six of the 12 songs, giving Bentley new roles to play, but ones that he thinks reflect his true self. "The fans love the songs," he says. "If you wrote it, great. If you didn't, whatever."
What mattered was Bentley's tenacity in injecting himself into those songs, says producer Luke Wooten, who has been working with Bentley for the singer's entire professional career. "I don't know that he ever sleeps," Wooten says. "If he's got production ideas, you may get a text at 2:30 in the morning."
That drive helped Bentley get a leg up when he arrived in Nashville in 1994. The singer remembers being 18 years old and struggling to navigate an industry town suddenly swarming with Wrangler-and-Stetson clones hoping to become the next Garth Brooks. The disillusionment was almost instantaneous.
"It was like seeing the wizard behind the curtain," he remembers. "It lost a little of its magic."
He found a different kind of magic when a friend dragged him to the Station Inn, the bluegrass club where Bentley fell under the spell of banjos, fiddles and mandolins. He still endeavored to make popular country songs in the mold of Hank Williams Jr. and Merle Haggard, but he made a point to pepper each album with a little bluegrass.
Success followed. Three of Bentley's albums have topped the country charts, while two others came very close. That's what made "Up on the Ridge" feel like such a gutsy move - one that Bentley says he had to make after spending 2009 on a tour that seemed never-ending.
"We'd be onstage for 45 minutes, and we had a really tight show," Bentley says. "But the other 23 hours and 15 minutes of my life that year felt stifling. I was in the back in the bus thinking about how I need to do something different. . . . ["Up on the Ridge"] was totally off the grid with no rules at all." 
Bentley didn't want to lose that feel with "Home" - so much so that he scrapped the first version of the album. "I realized that the record we made had gotten too far away from 'Up on the Ridge,' " he says. "You can't put acoustic [instruments] on afterwards. It sounds fake. . . . I had to get it right."
The album-closing ballad "Thinking of You" got its finishing touches when Bentley visited the District in November - it was his birthday, and his family had e-mailed him a video of his 2-year-old daughter singing the song's refrain: "Thinking of you, that's all I do, all the time / You're always the first and last thing on this heart of mine."
"I was lonesome," Bentley says. "I hate hotel rooms. You're alone, and there are a thousand other lonely people who have been there before you. And here's my daughter singing the song back to me. It killed me." He decided to add it as the album's coda. A longing ballad was now a love song from a road-weary father to his faraway child. 
The next day, Bentley performed the song "Home," an understated and elegant ode to America, at a country music celebration at the White House. He says he was inspired to write a song that expressed togetherness after the shooting of Arizona congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords - as well as the distribution of campaign materials that targeted Democratic lawmakers' congressional districts by superimposing crosshairs on a map.
"Nasty stuff," Bentley says, shaking his head. He points his thumb over his shoulder at the line of fans waiting outside the tour bus. "But if you look out there, I think we have a lot more in common than what divides us."
In two hours, he'll be singing "Home" onstage at the Recher, standing at the rare intersection of post-Sept. 11 patriotism and humility. It's a performance that could only come from someone who took the time to get it right. 
"Trying to get those emotions through the speakers," Bentley says. "That's country music."

CLEMSON, S.C. -Maryland had played this game, it seemed, so many times this season - building double-digit leads on tenacious defense and explosive scoring bursts only to let its opponents seize the upper hand down the stretch.
In the last week alone, that narrative cost Maryland a potential victory in a double-overtime thriller at Miami and squelched what would have been a stunning upset of No. 5 North Carolina at Comcast Center. 
Tuesday at Clemson's Littlejohn Coliseum, Maryland finally got the ending right, fending off a furious late-game rally by the Tigers that slashed a 14-point Terrapins lead to one with 74 seconds remaining and holding on for a 64-62 victory.
It was the first triumph on the road for Maryland (14-9, 4-5 ACC) this season, snapping a two-game losing streak and girding the Terrapins' confidence for Saturday's game against Duke at Cameron Indoor Stadium.
"We really needed this win," said sophomore guard Terrell Stoglin, who finished with a game-high 27 points and four steals. "We get to go home happy now."
Coach Mark Turgeon commended his players' effort and smarts on defense, where they held Clemson to 22 first-half points and 34.9 percent shooting in the game, and their teamwork on offense, where they collected 14 assists on 23 baskets.
But a bit of luck helped the Terps, too.
With Maryland leading 61-58, point guard Pe'Shon Howard fouled Clemson's senior guard and leading scorer, Andre Young, on a three-point attempt with 10.7 seconds remaining.
That gave Young the chance to force overtime by knocking down three successive free-throws.
Stoglin sent up a prayer. He wasn't alone among the Terps, who looked on as Young clanged his first two attempts off the rim.
"The whole time he was shooting, I was praying," Stoglin said. "Thank God, he missed! I didn't think he was going to miss."
There were other close calls for the Terps.
Clemson's Milton Jennings hit a three-pointer with 2.8 seconds remaining to pull the Tigers within one point. But Maryland senior Sean Mosley drew a foul and hit one of his shots for the final margin.
Mosley finished with a game-high six assists and 16 points - the first of which, a free throw less than three minutes into the game, represented the 1,000th of his Maryland career.
"Coming into the game, I just wanted to win," said Mosley, the 50th Terrapin to reach the 1,000-point mark. "I didn't care if I scored or not. But guys got me the ball. I couldn't score 1,000 points by myself, so I'm blessed in that aspect."
With the defeat, Clemson fell to 11-12, 3-6. Maryland moved out of its tie with the Tigers for seventh in the ACC standings.
Averaging just 64.9 points per game, Clemson didn't pose the offensive challenge that Maryland's most recent opponent, North Carolina did. 
But both teams shot poorly at the start.
"We couldn't pass or catch, either," Turgeon said. "And they were doing the same thing."
More than eight minutes into the game, the score was 8-8, with both teams shooting less than 30 percent from the field.
Stoglin jump-started the Terps, creating plays from nothing, stripping balls and racing down court for layups, stepping beyond the arc for three-pointers and earning his customary trips to the free throw line.
With three minutes to play in the first half, Stoglin had scored more than half of Maryland's points (13 of 23) on 5-of-6 shooting and had all three of the Terps' steals.
After taking a 26-22 halftime lead, Maryland kept the pressure on in the second half, going on a 13-2 run.
With Maryland leading 53-39, Turgeon warned it was no time to let up.
That's precisely when Clemson made its run. The listless crowd of 7,321 came alive when Young (15 points) and Jennings (14) hit back-to-back three-pointers to cut Maryland's lead to single digits.

'I am not a solo flier'

BYLINE: Pamela Constable

SECTION: STYLE; Pg. C01

In both style and substance, Sherry Rehman was born to be a Washington diplomat and hostess. She has a designer wardrobe, a chestnut coif and camera-ready makeup. She also has a BA from Smith, a CV full of democratic credentials and the articulate self-confidence of her country's Westernized elite.
But Rehman's arrival as the new ambassador from Pakistan, a nuclear-armed, terrorist-plagued nation of 180 million, has come at a time of unprecedented anti-American clamor among the Pakistani public, which has been increasingly drawn to conservative Islamic values and infuriated by U.S. drone attacks and other perceived aggressions.
She has also landed in Washington at a time of deepening bilateral mistrust, marked by the covert U.S. raid that killed Osama bin Laden, the shooting of two Pakistanis by a CIA contractor and, most recently, the November attack by U.S. forces in Afghanistan that killed 24 Pakistani soldiers. Ongoing tension between these two formal allies in the war on terrorism has plunged U.S.-Pakistan relations to their lowest point since the end of the Cold War. 
Moreover, the civilian administration that appointed Rehman is deeply unpopular, besieged by the courts and the media, and under constant pressure from Pakistan's powerful military establishment. The crisis has led to repeated rumors, so far unrealized, that the elected government is about to fall.
Rehman, 51, seems undaunted. She learned the art of politics at the side of the late Benazir Bhutto, Pakistan's former prime minister, a liberal icon and a steel magnolia par excellence. Since taking up her post two weeks ago, the new envoy has handled her challenging portfolio with similar, purposeful charm.
"You'll have to airbrush out the circles under my eyes. I was up all night with a Pentagon crisis," Rehman remarked cheerfully to a photographer last week, posing for portraits in Pakistan's embassy, a hushed and impersonal marble fortress off Connecticut Avenue in Northwest Washington.
The crisis in question had erupted after a stinging new comment on Pakistan's "double dealing" by Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta, which Rehman spent hours attempting to spin lest it provoke an apoplectic reaction from her country's easily offended generals.
Making her entry equally difficult are the tumultuous, intrigue-filled circumstances that led to the forced resignation of her predecessor, Husain Haqqani, in late November. That incident, a reflection of the constant plots, rumors and institutional power struggles that consume Pakistani politics, became a full-blown scandal known as "Memogate."
Haqqani, a former journalist and academic long critical of Pakistan's military, was ordered home and accused of treason after he was said to have written a memo asking U.S. officials for help in preventing a coup d'etat. Haqqani denied the charges, but he spent most of December and January hiding inside the prime minister's house, saying he feared for his safety. By last week, the furor had eased and Haqqani, given back his right to travel, was reportedly heading back to the United States as a private citizen.
In an interview last week, Rehman was careful not to criticize Haqqani, a one-man political operator who was constantly tweeting, meeting and spinning in several directions at once. But she signaled that she intends to do things differently, saying, "I am not a solo flier. I like to consult and to act institutionally."
Asked what Pakistan's army brass thought of her appointment, she answered euphemistically. "The message I am getting is that everyone is able to work with me," she said. "I come from a long tradition that is anti-establishment, but I am very clear that here, I speak for one government."
After months of turmoil, Rehman's appointment has been viewed as a breath of fresh air in Islamabad and Washington. William Milam, a former U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, described her as "tough and courageous," and said she represents "the traditional values of Jinnah's Pakistan, tolerance and moderation." Mohammed Ali Jinnah was the founder of Pakistan in the 1940s, and Rehman chairs a foundation dedicated to preserving his vision of Muslim democracy.
Accolades have also poured in from Pakistan's Internet-savvy diaspora. "GREAT CHOICE," Arif Khan, a Pakistani American, posted in one of dozens of complimentary online responses to a recent news story about Rehman. "She is a liberal and an educated person, not stuck to religion like glue. She has a moderate interpretation of Islam, which needs to be presented to the modern world of six billion non-Muslims. Good luck, Sherry, and welcome to the USA."
Rehman has few illusions that her liberal credentials, including 20 years as a prominent journalist, will help thaw the deep freeze between Washington and Islamabad. A series of disputes and incidents, capped by the fatal U.S. air assault on two Pakistani border posts in November, have left their so-called strategic partnership in a state of exhaustion. After years of pledges to cooperate in fighting Islamic extremism and violence, bolstered by millions in U.S. aid, both military establishments seem to have abandoned all pretense of trust.
"We are in a process of strategic reset," Rehman said, speaking from an obviously vetted script. "I feel strongly that Pakistan and the United States can have a rational, constructive, predictable and transparent relationship, but we have not had that in a sustained way for too long. We need to lower expectations and do business in a grounded way. We need a relationship that is invested with less emotion."
Yet even such a pragmatic, scaled-down agenda will be difficult to pursue given the continuing political crisis in Pakistan, where the civilian government that appointed Rehman is bogged down in power struggles with an array of institutional and personal adversaries. In a way, the ambassador's toughest diplomatic balancing act will be internal.
President Asif Ali Zardari, Bhutto's widower, is a weak and unpopular leader whose tenure has been clouded by corruption charges and recurrent rumors of an army takeover or a judicial "soft coup." Last week, the Supreme Court threatened to impeach Prime Minister Yusuf Gilani for not pursuing corruption cases against Zardari that have long been stalled in Swiss courts.
Rehman, a longtime legislator from the ruling Pakistan People's Party, once served the fledgling Zardari-Gilani administration as information minister. But in 2009, she abruptly quit in frustration over the government's attempt to place restrictions on press freedom, remaining a member of Parliament and foundation official.
So why did she agree to this new appointment? Was it in part because Washington offered her haven from a country where outspoken liberals are increasingly under threat of violent attack? Just a year ago, Rehman was confined to her family mansion in Karachi, under 24-hour police guard, after receiving death threats from radical Islamists. At this moment she is facing charges of blasphemy against Islam, a capital crime in Pakistan, which were filed by Islamist groups in connection with her public support for reforming the nation's draconian blasphemy laws.
"I have never run away from Pakistan, and I will be back as soon as I can," Rehman asserted sharply. "I never left when the mullahs were at the door. Washington is lovely, but this is a hardship post for me." Noting that her husband and college-aged daughter have stayed behind at home, she insisted that she had accepted the post only because the government "asked me to step up to the plate at a difficult and challenging time for Pakistan. I had very little option," she said. "I have never said no to an opportunity to serve my country."
Although Rehman's new role in Washington requires her to be cagily circumspect on issues of military and foreign policy, it is allowing her some breathing space on domestic social issues she has long championed, including the rights of women and religious minorities. Last week, she chose to hold her first embassy dinner in honor of Paul Bhatti, a visiting Christian leader whose brother, a former Pakistani cabinet minister for religious minority affairs, was assassinated last year. The dinner was low-key, with no speeches, but it made her point.
"We may be under siege, but we will not be silent," said Rehman, who dresses in traditional Pakistani tunic-and-trouser ensembles but does not wear a Muslim head scarf. "We must empower minorities where we can, and protect all vulnerable groups against the extremist tide."
For a moment, Rehman sounded a lot like her mentor, Bhutto. The longtime People's Party leader was assassinated in 2007 while greeting a crowd of supporters; she had hoped to run for Parliament after years in exile. Rehman, one of her closest aides, was inside Bhutto's vehicle when the former premier collapsed, fatally wounded. The unsolved attack robbed the nation of its most charismatic leader and perhaps its best hope for democracy after a decade of military rule.
Asked if she wished she could be here representing a Bhutto administration, Rehman shook her head. "I see myself as her ambassador, too," she said. "It has always been her. I can never end a speech without making a tribute to her." On the wall of Rehman's new embassy office, in a prominent spot usually hung with portraits of current Pakistani officials, smiles the instantly recognizable face of Benazir Bhutto.

Video shows officer hitting teen with his gun

BYLINE: Matt Zapotosky

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B03

LENGTH: 449 words

The attorney for a Cottage City teenager who was arrested Friday said surveillance cameras captured a Prince George's County police officer hitting his client with a gun in such a way that the weapon discharged. 
Jimmy Bell, the defense attorney, said he had not seen the video but had been briefed about it by those who had. A law enforcement source who saw the video corroborated his account, saying it shows an officer approach the teenager, draw his weapon and strike him in the head. At some point, the gun fired but no one was injured, police said.
On Tuesday, police announced that they were dropping some charges against the teenager after video evidence called into question the account officers provided. They said they were referring the case to the county state's attorney's office, which is conducting an investigation into the officers' conduct.
The incident began about 9:40 p.m. Friday, when officers in the Brentwood area saw two people - at least one wearing a mask - go into the Lowest Price Gas station convenience store, authorities have said.
According to the account police first gave in charging documents, officers thought that the men were about to rob the store. One of the men, 19-year-old Ryan Keith Dorm, punched a detective and then ran, according to the documents. Another detective, Donald Taylor, chased him and saw what he thought was a gun fall from Dorm's waistband, the charging papers allege. He drew his gun, and Dorm "charged towards" him and "attempted to disarm him." The encounter caused Taylor's gun to fire, according to the documents.
Dorm was charged with two counts of second-degree assault, three counts of second-degree assault on a law enforcement officer and resisting arrest. A spokesman for Prince George's State's Attorney Angela Alsobrooks said prosecutors would drop one second-degree assault charge and two charges of second-degree assault on a law enforcement officer. Dorm remains jailed on a $15,000 bond.
Police said that Taylor and an officer who was a witness were suspended with pay. Vince Canales, president of the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 89, declined to comment on their behalf.
Carlos Acosta, the police department's inspector general, said detectives still "believe that crimes were committed" but would not elaborate. Bell denied that his client committed any crimes.
The other man, Brion Elzie, 20, of Colmar Manor, said that he and Dorm went to the store to buy snacks and that he was wearing a ski mask because it was cold. He said he was not sure why Dorm ran.
"We wouldn't even put ourselves in that position," Elzie said. "We come to that store every day, and we know the people that work in there."

The NBA ' s all-star game

BYLINE: Michael Lee

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. D03

LENGTH: 1158 words

DATELINE: IN NEW YORK

Carmelo Anthony, in civilian clothes and wearing a backward baseball cap, smiled and applauded as the final seconds ticked down on the New York Knicks' unlikely and spirited win on Monday over the Utah Jazz. Anthony then called his teammates together at center court for some hugs and a huddle. 
That Jeremy Lin, an undersize, Ivy League-educated point guard who was in the NBA Development League just two weeks ago, and Jared Jeffries, an underappreciated power forward who elicits groans from fans at Madison Square Garden for his innovative ways of missing layups, were the catalysts for the 99-88 victory - and not Anthony or fellow all-star Amare Stoudemire - was evidence that the game and this season have not gone as intended in New York.
Anthony pulled up lame in the first quarter of the game, suffering a strained right groin while simply running up the court, and will be out one to two weeks. Earlier in the day, Stoudemire's older brother, Hazell, was killed in a car accident in Lake Wales, Fla. Neither is expected to be on the floor when the Washington Wizards host the Knicks on Wednesday at Verizon Center.  
The inability of those two stars to meld their games and produce wins, in addition to deficient point guard play, has contributed to a situation in which the star-studded Knicks (10-15) wouldn't make the playoffs if the season ended today. To this point, they have served as a cautionary tale for superstar unions, which have been popular since the Boston Celtics threw three perennial all-stars together and won a championship in one year.
"We do have some issues we have to work out and the point guard is one of the issues," Knicks Coach Mike D'Antoni said. "We struggled and it hasn't been pretty up to now. But if we can solve some of those problems and get lucky, we'll be okay."
Elite talent is necessary to become a championship-caliber team, but chemistry is just as, if not more, important. When the Los Angeles Lakers traded for all-star Pau Gasol, he immediately clicked with former league most valuable player Kobe Bryant and the team made three consecutive trips to the NBA Finals, winning titles 2009 and 2010. The Clippers have quickly ascended to the top of the Pacific Division since acquiring all-star point guard Chris Paul to throw lobs to all-star forward Blake Griffin.
"There's a lot of reasons," Celtics Coach Doc Rivers said, when asked why his team was able to win its first season with Paul Pierce, Ray Allen and former MVP Kevin Garnett. "I think in our case I thought we had the right group of guys, sold the right package to them as far as playing together and they bought into it. I don't think it gets much deeper than that. I think we had the right fit of guys and the timing was good for them." 
When LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh decided to join forces in Miami in the summer of 2010, they knew that they would have to adjust their games and roles in order for it to work. The Heat stumbled to a 9-8 start last season, regrouped and advanced to the NBA Finals, but Bosh said it was impossible to know for certain that it would work. 
"At the end of the day, it's a crap shoot. Just like life," Bosh said. "You don't really know what's going to happen. You assume, and maybe your assumptions will be correct. But until that time you have to deal with that chemistry and really work on things. Things don't just come together. Things are not easy. Maybe you are a more talented team on paper, but that doesn't mean much. You have to be a cohesive unit, play together in order to win."
The Knicks have realized that being taken seriously as a contender requires more than adding big-name players with accomplished rsums. Since acquiring Anthony from Denver last February, the Knicks have gone 24-29, while Anthony's former team has the third-best record in the Western Conference. 
Anthony's arrival wasn't the final piece of the puzzle, because it actually created a new  problem for D'Antoni. Stoudemire had lifted the Knicks into playoff contention before the team decided to gut its roster and ship four starters and a first-round draft pick to the Nuggets for Anthony. 
Anthony and Stoudemire both need a lot of touches to be effective and haven't figured out how to defer and share, and when to be assertive. 
Stoudemire has been slumping and Anthony is shooting a career-worst 39.9 percent while dealing with injuries to his wrist, ankle and thumb. Anthony's latest setback - a strain - has effectively described his season in New York, as he recently experienced an introspective moment, telling reporters after a loss to Denver, "Maybe I need to not take so many shots."
The Knicks made the biggest move of the offseason, acquiring Tyson Chandler in a sign-and-trade deal with the defending champion Dallas Mavericks. Chandler turned down several suitors to come to New York, which was swept out of the first round of the playoffs last season. 
"I just envisioned myself, Amare and 'Melo, being able to punish teams - with our size, what we are, what we've been able to bring to teams throughout our careers," Chandler said. "I felt like the combination, we could be a great contender and championship-bound. I still feel that way."
But without a veteran point guard running the show, having arguably the most talented front court has been the equivalent of placing a Bentley on bricks instead of wheels. It looks good up top, but isn't going anywhere. The Knicks used the amnesty clause to waive Chauncey Billups in order to get Chandler, and signed Mike Bibby and Baron Davis. Bibby has been ineffective and Davis has yet to make his season debut, sidelined with back and elbow problems. 
D'Antoni has experimented with several options. He used Anthony as a facilitator, then tried shooting guard Toney Douglas and rookie Iman Shumpert until he found a competent floor leader - for two games at least - in Lin. Lin, a former star at Harvard, had already been cut by Houston and Golden State before exploding for 53 points and 15 assists and leading the Knicks to two wins. Fans in New York have already serenaded him with "MVP" chants and D'Antoni said he would ride Lin "like frigging Secretariat." 
"Our expectations are still high," D'Antoni said. "We want to turn it around. We want to be a viable team, get in the playoffs and make some hay. We think we can. We have the guys to do it. They still believe. They are still trying."
Chandler is urging for patience. "I think, being here in New York, everybody wants everything now," Chandler said. "We're all new players, playing with each other. We're not used to one another, we didn't have a training camp. We didn't have many practices, so it's even worse than what other teams were able to go through, because we didn't have a summer and all of that stuff to get accustomed to one another, so we're learning on the fly."
And still waiting to take off.

Baking with a conscience pays off for Doron Petersan, 'Cupcake Wars' all-star

BYLINE: Ellen McCarthy

SECTION: FOOD; Pg. E01

LENGTH: 1248 words

Doron Petersan, Washington's punk-rock queen of vegan cupcakes, did not go happily into The Land Without Meat. 
It happened almost unintentionally. Petersan, owner of Sticky Fingers Sweets & Eats in Columbia Heights, was in her early 20s, waiting tables in New York City as her aspirations of becoming an actor faded. There was more fun to be had in the chaos and camaraderie of restaurants, where she fell in love with food in a new way. But she still wasn't sure what to do with her life. 
Always a pet lover, she began volunteering first with a veterinarian and then with an animal shelter and control agency. 
After work one day, she sat down to eat a turkey sandwich. But she couldn't take a bite. She'd just assisted with a surgery on an injured dog, and the meat looked too similar to the dog's open flesh.  
Petersan was despondent. She'd grown up in a close-knit family; her mother was Italian, her father was Jewish and food was at the center of their lives. Vegetarianism would mean brutal deprivation. 
But she saw no choice. Her work with animal control had changed her. The first day on the job she saw 50 homeless dogs  euthanized. Petersan was increasingly appalled by the lack of connection between people and animals. 
She asked her Italian grandmother to start cooking her favorite meaty dishes and gathered her family for a going-out party. "I was force-feeding myself my grandmother's meatballs and chicken cutlets. I thought that was it, so I was like, 'Bye-bye everything I knew,'ג[#x20ac][#x160]" says Petersan, who often appears in pictures looking like a roller-derby pin-up, with bright red lipstick and a blunt fringe of bangs. In person she is softer, more natural. The bangs have grown out, the tattoos on her arms are covered by a pastel knit sweater and only the holes of piercings along her ears and bottom lip remain. 
She is confident and chatty, with dark eyes and a brunette ponytail she frequently twirls around her index finger. She is 39 now and has come a long way since that first month of hummus and tofu and not too much else. This is turning out to be a year of fruition for Petersan: The shop is thriving, she was recently named champion of "Cupcake Wars: All-Stars" on Food Network, her first cookbook comes out Feb. 15, and in September she and her husband adopted a baby boy named Ezra. All of which is overwhelmingly wonderful and would only be better, she says, "if I didn't need sleep." 
Petersan moved to Washington in 1996 to be with her husband, also an animal-rights activist, and took a job with the Humane Society. But she soon burned out on the heartache that went with the job and enrolled at the University of Maryland to study nutrition and dietetics. 
A class on food science altered her understanding of what was possible within the parameters of a vegan diet. She had been experimenting in her kitchen for years by then, trying to re-create family favorites without using animal products and getting mixed results. 
Now she started to work backward; understanding, for example, the role eggs play in leavening a cake and figuring out how to achieve that same reaction with other ingredients. 
She started with Italian rice balls and cannoli, the things she missed most. "I called my grandmother and asked her for the recipe, the traditional recipe," she says. "I want to look at what are the things that people really take from that flavor and what was in the texture. I think the first time I made [cannoli], it was just a cracker shell with some really good vanilla pudding."
But she was hooked on the process and by the time she graduated in 2002, she knew she wanted to open a bakery. "There was nothing that was vegan on purpose that was delicious, or that you couldn't resist," she says. 
She began renting kitchen time at a bakery in Dupont Circle in 2000. When that business closed in 2002, she took over the space. By then she had taken on a partner, and the two of them sketched out a business plan on a sheet of loose-leaf paper. 
"We had no idea what it was going to take," she remembers. "We were so naive, and thank God we were, or else we never would've opened. We just had gusto."
They didn't put the word "vegan" on their sign and didn't mention it to customers who didn't ask. "That's the true test, right?" she says. "Do you have a line of people out the door or do you have a line of just vegans out the door?"
Both carnivores and vegetarians scooped up their sticky buns and brownies, and in 2006 the business moved to a bigger space in Columbia Heights. A retro oven and refrigerator were brought in to hold condiments and the cabinets were painted mint green to give the feel of a 1950s kitchen. By then, Petersan's partner had moved on to tour with a rock band. 
The bakery's menu expanded to include breakfast and lunch dishes, and the shop garnered interest from bakers in Korea who came to train with Petersan for several weeks before returning home to open an outpost of the Sticky Fingers franchise in Seoul. Sticky Fingers also launched a wholesale business, packaging its products for resale at Whole Foods and other local stores. 
Last year Petersan got a call from Food Network, offering her a spot on the baking competition "Cupcake Wars." She was pitted against another vegan baker and two others who used dairy products. Petersan won. 
"I thought it was going to be a long shot. But also that we absolutely have to win this because we're the underdog," she says. "So we went in it with full guns blazing."
The secret, she says, is in using high-quality ingredients and knowing how to work with them. Instead of butter, she uses non-hydrogenated margarines and shortenings. Soy milk, coconut milk, fresh fruits and nuts "are imperative," as is really good chocolate and the restraint to not overmix a cake batter.
In her second time on the show, she was cut in the second round, but Petersan was invited back for an All-Stars lineup. That time she and an assistant won with a collection of rock-and-roll-inspired cupcakes that included the Salt-n-Peppa, a "chocolate bourbon smoked pepper cupcake" with salted caramel, vanilla bean frosting and a tiny pair of headphones made of fondant. 
Each time the shows aired, the line at the counter grew a little longer. Sticky Fingers now sells thousands of cupcakes each week. People have begun asking to have their pictures taken with Petersan. It's an odd thing to be a semi-celebrity vegan, but she's not complaining. "The bigger picture is to show that vegan food is not scary," she says. "It's not a bad word, and my mission - my passion - is to prove it." 
Petersan had been tossing around the idea of a cookbook for years but wasn't sure the already-crowded market needed a new addition. An agent persuaded her otherwise, and within weeks a publishing house bought rights to the book.
"Sticky Fingers' Sweets! 100 Super-Secret Vegan Recipes" will be released by Avery next week. Petersan writes with cheeky delight, relaying insights on nutrition and food science between recipes for Boston Creme Cake and tiramisu. 
Petersan and her husband also had been working on an adoption for years. In September they brought home an infant with round cheeks and skin the color of milk chocolate. "He's delicious," Petersan coos as she beams at a picture of Ezra on her cellphone. 
Today she is three parts exhilarated, one part exhausted. 
"It's like everything that you ever wanted happened at once," she says. "But it's awesome, and I'd do it all again in a heartbeat."

The D.C. Council has approved a bill that would make it easier for same-sex couples who marry in the nation's capital to get divorced.
The bill would allow gay couples who married in Washington to divorce even if they no longer live in the District, provided they live somewhere that would not recognize their divorce. Under current law, one member of the divorcing couple has to live in Washington for six months before starting divorce proceedings.
The council approved the bill unanimously Tuesday in a preliminary vote. It will get a final vote before being sent to Mayor Vincent C. Gray (D) for his signature. 
The District began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples in March 2010. Six states also allow same-sex marriage.

Teen, young man killed in Pr. George's
Prince George's County police said a teenager and a young man were fatally shot in the same area Monday night, and detectives are investigating whether the slayings are linked.
Christopher Donald Smith, 16, a student at Flowers High School, was found fatally shot about 10:45 p.m. by a passerby in the 5300 block of 85th Avenue in the New Carrollton area, police said.
As the ambulance that responded left the scene about 11:30 p.m., police said, the emergency crew inside came upon another victim less than a mile away in West Lanham Hills. Alfonso Edward Thompson Jr., 23, had been shot, apparently while riding a bicycle, police said.
Police said they have not determined a suspect or motive in the killings.

Man pleads guiltyin child porn case 
A former Prince George's County school bus driver pleaded guilty Tuesday to two counts of producing child pornography, authorities said.
Scott Smallwood of Upper Marlboro sexually abused a         7-year-old boy by engaging in sexual conduct both in front of and with the boy while producing video of the acts with his cellphone.
According to Smallwood, he left the microSD card from his cellphone on the counter of a convenience store in Clinton in March 2010. The card was found and turned in to the police the same day, who found eight sexually explicit videos involving the child. 
Smallwood, who previously drove school buses for Prince George's County public schools and a church, was arrested in May 2010. He admitted to          luring the boy to his home for "sleepovers," where he offered candy in exchange for sexual contact.

Pr. George's council backs 5-cent bag tax
The Prince George's County Council endorsed a 5-cent tax on bags, opening the way for the General Assembly to approve a bill that would give the county the right to impose the tax.
The council voted 8 to 0, with one abstention, Tuesday to back the tax, which supporters say will help the county reduce trash and clean up roadways and neighborhoods.
The measure was pushed by County Council member Mary A. Lehman (D-Laurel).
Council member Karen Toles (D-Suitland) abstained, saying she wanted assurances that the measure would not harm low-income residents.
The measure is expected to be taken up soon by the Prince George's House and Senate delegations. If the bill is approved in Annapolis, it opens the way for the County Council to enact a local law imposing the tax. Montgomery County and the District have 5-cent bag taxes. District officials report that it has cut down on the use of disposable bags and also helped reduce trash. Montgomery's law took effect last month.

Obama's lucky break

BYLINE: Dana Milbank

SECTION: EDITORIAL COPY; Pg. A19

LENGTH: 789 words

It's nine months until Election Day, but President Obama is already bringing out the big guns.
Specifically, he is shouldering the Extreme Marshmallow Cannon.
Obama walked into the State Dining Room at midday Tuesday and encountered, as part of a science fair, 14-year-old Joe Hudy and the compressed-air cannon he invented to launch marshmallows. 
"The Secret Service is going to be mad at me about this," the president said, but he didn't care. He asked Hudy to hand over the gun, told onlookers to step aside, pumped up the compressor - and shot a confection across the room Thomas Jefferson used as his office. Under the watchful gaze of an Abraham Lincoln portrait, the projectile narrowly missed a window and smacked into a wall near the entrance to the Red Room. 
Minutes later, the commander in chief went downstairs to the East Room to report on his marksmanship, telling the assembled TV cameras that he "shot a marshmallow through an air gun, which was very exciting."
It was so exciting that White House press secretary Jay Carney led off Tuesday afternoon's briefing with more talk of the Extreme Marshmallow Cannon, suggesting that he would like to arm himself with one on the podium. "I hope you enjoyed the science fair," he said. "The president sure did." Carney then moved on to discuss "another moment of the president's day that the president enjoyed" - chatting with the New York Giants head coach.
Obama suddenly seems to be enjoying himself quite a bit, and no wonder: He just might be the luckiest man alive. 
At the last possible moment to save his reelection, the economy is beginning to hum, as evidenced by Friday's jobs report. And Obama's Republican opponents are shaping up to be as formidable as, well, marshmallows. While Mitt Romney, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum are making each other unelectable, the president is singing Al Green, congratulating Super Bowl winners, playing with science projects, raising obscene amounts of campaign cash and watching his poll numbers soar. 
According to historical patterns, the high unemployment rate and slow economic growth should combine to doom Obama. But historical patterns do not take into account an opponent who says he enjoys firing people. This week's Washington Post-ABC News poll showed Obama with a nine-point lead over Romney and a 15-point lead over Gingrich. And political handicapper Charlie Cook wrote Tuesday about a fundamental shift in Obama's prospects, as the GOP position retreats from "cautiously optimistic" to "uncertainty."
In politics, it's better to be lucky than good, and Obama has come into an unexpectedly large quantity of luck. Five straight monthly drops in the unemployment rate have boosted consumer confidence and stock markets. 
And, while Obama does nothing more than sit and watch, his opponents are alienating the  electorate. Conservative blogger Erick Erickson summed up the disenchantment this week when he said that he would rather have the "sweet meteor of death than any of the candidates left in the race." Santorum's unexpected revival in Tuesday's primaries - essentially a protest vote - indicates that Erickson has plenty of company.
While Romney embraces the birther billionaire Donald Trump, he has ceded to Obama the political center. The day after Romney indelicately announced that he was "not concerned about the very poor," Obama spoke at the National Prayer Breakfast about his affection for the Rev. Billy Graham and about "the biblical call to care for the least of these - for the poor; for those at the margins of our society."
The run of luck has left Obama in buoyant spirits, which were on display in the White House on Tuesday. Leaving aside the crisis in Syria and a dispute with the Catholic bishops, he lingered at the science fair to talk to the teen inventors and try their toys, including a robot made from a trash can ("I'm trying to figure out how you got through the metal detectors," Obama commented) and sugar packets made from dissolving packaging ("Tell me when I can buy stock," the president said). 
He turned to three girls from Texas who had built rockets, including one with a cherry-blossom design. "This is not a tough-looking rocket," the president said, "with the flowers and birds and stuff. . . . You just don't usually see rockets this pretty."
The president then recounted for the girls his own experiment of dropping eggs with Sasha from the Truman Balcony. "I'm hip to the whole egg thing," he said, before agreeing to the girls' request for a group hug.
For a man who has until recently been focused on his own survival, it's a newfound luxury to spend quality time with robots and marshmallows. "I've got to say," a grinning Obama said, "this is fun."

Chinese official on leave amid defection rumors

BYLINE: William Wan

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A10

LENGTH: 441 words

The deputy mayor of Chongqing, a major city in southwestern China, has taken a leave from his job amid rumors that he tried to seek asylum at a U.S. consulate. 
Chongqing officials posted a short, cryptic message on a microblog - the Chinese equivalent of Twitter - on Wednesday, saying that Wang Lijun was "receiving a vacation-style treatment" for overwork and mental stress. Several Chinese microblogs speculated that Wang, a former city police chief, had sought to defect and posted pictures purportedly showing police surrounding the U.S. consulate in nearby Chengdu on Tuesday night.
The episode drew unusual attention because Wang has close ties to Bo Xilai, Chongqing's charismatic Communist Party chief and a rising star within the party who has been campaigning for a seat on the Politburo Standing Committee. A key part of Bo's appeal involves his high-profile crackdown on crime and corruption in recent years.
Wang played an integral role in that effort, in which police arrested several alleged criminal leaders while confiscating drugs and guns.
The U.S. State Department confirmed Wednesday that Wang had requested and attended a meeting Monday at the Chengdu consulate, but U.S. officials would not comment on whether he sought asylum.
"He did visit the consulate, and he later left the consulate of his own volition," said State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland.
Responding to online reports that Wang was forced to leave the consulate or dragged out, she said, "He walked out. It was his choice."
 At a news briefing in Beijing on Thursday morning, Cui Tiankai, the vice foreign minister in charge of U.S. affairs, declined to offer specifics about Wang's visit to the U.S. consulate, but, he said, the upcoming visit to Washington by Vice President Xi Jinping would not be affected by the incident.
Asked later to elaborate, Cui said, "This issue has been resolved, and resolved quite smoothly."
It was unclear whether Wang's departure resulted from a falling out between him and Bo. It was also unclear how the episode involving Wang could affect Bo's political aspirations. Bo has pursued the Politburo seat with the zeal of a Western-style populist, most notably through "red culture," a revival of socialist songs and culture from Mao Zedong's time.

Hinkle arrives late, but it's just in time for American

BYLINE: Steven Goff

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. D03

LENGTH: 759 words

The American University men's basketball team was in a tight spot last weekend, losing at Colgate by a point in the final minute. Had this scenario played out a year ago, Charles Hinkle would've been, at best, the fourth choice to win the game.
But Vlad Moldoveanu has graduated, Stephen Lumpkins chose a baseball contract over his senior season of basketball and top returning player Troy Brewer was still not in the flow after returning from foot and ankle injuries. 
As they've done throughout this season, the Eagles turned to Hinkle, who has blossomed into one of the nation's finest scorers. Coach Jeff Jones charted a play for the 6-foot-5 senior forward. "It didn't work the way we wanted," Hinkle said, "but I found my spot."
Hinkle was spot-on with 33 seconds left, hitting his fourth three-pointer of the half to lift the Eagles (15-8, 6-2 Patriot League) to their fifth victory in six games and remain tied with Lehigh (18-6, 6-2) for second in the conference behind preseason favorite Bucknell (18-6, 8-0).
AU and Lehigh will collide Thursday night at Bender Arena in a game that features the conference's leading scorers: Mountain Hawks junior guard C.J. McCollum (21.3 points per game) and Hinkle (19.7).
Entering Wednesday night, Hinkle ranked 18th nationally in scoring among more than 4,000 Division I players. He is 30th in three-point percentage at 42.2, leads the Patriot League in three-pointers made (62) and minutes per game (34.5) and is fourth in free throw accuracy at 83.1 percent.
All of this has come after he averaged just 4.5 points last season - his first in Washington. Hinkle spent 21 / 2 years at Vanderbilt, where he redshirted with a broken foot and then struggled for playing time. He transferred to AU in the middle of his sophomore campaign and didn't become eligible until the team's ninth game last season.
How did a team from the Patriot League land a player from the mighty Southeastern Conference?
In summer 2007, the Eagles aggressively recruited Hinkle, who was a late bloomer on the national recruiting scene. Failing to receive any Division I offers at Los Alamitos (Calif.) High School, where he had started alongside current New York Knicks guard Landry Fields, he ventured to Hebron Academy in rural Maine to bolster his credentials.
Hinkle attracted attention at AAU tournaments and recruiting camps, and ultimately chose Vanderbilt over Iowa State and American.
"We were involved at least to the extent that he made a visit to campus, but when Vanderbilt offered, the bright lights were too much," Jones said. "It's a great example of not burning any bridges. He made his choice, we wished him well. In the back of your mind, you also have the thought that maybe it's not the right place, and if it's not, maybe we can get them on the rebound."
Jones's patience has been rewarded in recent years with transfers Hinkle, Moldoveanu (George Mason) and Brewer (Georgia).
Last year, with Moldoveanu providing the bulk of the scoring in his second and final season and Brewer making his debut, Hinkle averaged just 13 minutes.
"I thought I was going to have a bigger role, but I was playing behind Vlad and took it in stride," he said. "I knew my following year I would have a better opportunity."
Said Jones: "We knew he was a good player, we knew he could help us. How much and in what role, that was up in the air. He was playing a role of working hard, good defense, as opposed to what he does best: shooting the ball in the basket."
Hinkle's importance increased in the offseason when Lumpkins, a power forward who averaged 13.5 points and 8.2 rebounds, left school to sign with the Kansas City Royals and pursue a pitching career.
Hinkle's role heightened in the fall when Brewer injured his foot in an exhibition game. Brewer continued to play but wasn't at full strength. In December, in his first outing since returning from several weeks off, he hurt his ankle and missed two additional games.
With Brewer limited this season, Hinkle has led the way, scoring at least 20 points points 13 times, making at least four three-pointers nine times, and scoring 32 points against Saint Joseph's and 31 against Quinnipiac. In the past two games, he has averaged 23 points and made 9 of 16 three-pointers. He also shares the team rebounding lead with 5.5 per game.
"He has been tremendous," said Brewer, who is averaging 12.2 points. "With [Lumpkins] leaving and my injuries, it created a big opportunity for him. He's been the hot hand for us all year. When that happens, we're going to get him the ball."

Wizards can't slow down Lin

BYLINE: Michael Lee

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. D01

LENGTH: 850 words

John Wall hunkered down into his defensive stance, looking over his shoulder for New York Knicks center Tyson Chandler. Trying to anticipate a screen, the Washington Wizards point guard jumped back as Knicks counterpart Jeremy Lin did a crossover dribble. And before Wall could turn his head, Lin was already blowing past him toward a wide-open lane. 
Jordan Crawford and Maurice Evans stood frozen as Lin dunked and screamed with such excitement that the bandage on his chin came loose.  
In less than a week, Lin has gone from being a former Harvard standout, cut by two NBA teams, to an unlikely phenomenon for the Knicks. In Wednesday night's 107-93 win over the Wizards, Lin brought his inspiring story and surprisingly efficient game to Verizon Center, where a pro-Knicks crowd ignored the fact that its team was missing its all-star duo, Carmelo Anthony and Amare Stoudemire, and responded with glee to Lin's every dish and basket. 
After Lin finished with 23 points and a career-high 10 assists, Wizards Coach Randy Wittman had to absorb an equally painful text message from his son, Ryan, who played against Lin for four years in the Ivy League at Cornell. 
"He told me that they did a much better job guarding him than we did tonight," Wittman said with an uncomfortable chuckle. "Makes Dad feel good."
The Wizards did little to satisfy their coach, as the Knicks obliterated them in the pick-and-roll, with Lin repeatedly finding cutters to the basket or shooters camped out -  often wide-open - on the wings. Chandler benefited from several of the passes, as he scored a season-high 25 points and grabbed 11 rebounds. 
Steve Novak came off the bench to connect on five three-pointers and score 19 points. Reserve Iman Shumpert had 17 points and Landry Fields added 16 as the Knicks (11-15) won their third in a row - the last two coming without Stoudemire, whose brother was killed in a car accident on Monday, or Anthony, who suffered a strained right groin in a victory against Utah later that day. 
"I always expect to do better. It doesn't matter who you are playing against. Right now, after this, after this game, I wish they would've played," Wittman said of Stoudemire and Anthony. "We got beat off the dribble a lot. And we had fouls in reaching instead of moving our feet. They were the aggressors that had us on our heels from a defensive standpoint."
Wittman said he didn't think his players overlooked the undermanned Knicks. "Oh, gosh. You know, I hope not," he said. "If they do, shame on us."
Wizards forward Trevor Booker said during Wednesday morning's shoot-around that since his team lost to New York by three points last month in a game that featured Stoudemire and Anthony, the rematch without them was a contest "we should win."
Considering the Wizards (5-21) didn't have Andray Blatche (left calf strain) or Rashard Lewis (sore right knee) and have already lost to Chicago without Derrick Rose, Boston without two all-star starters, Toronto without Andrea Bargnani and Houston without Kevin Martin, it's difficult to think of many nights when they should feel like the superior team.
"I think that the most frustrating thing is throughout the season, already we've played a number of teams that have missed their star players or key players, and I don't think we've yet to capitalize on those situations," veteran swingman Evans said. "Although we're missing some players as well, it was just a golden opportunity for us to gain some momentum off a win against Toronto."
The Wizards, who have not won consecutive games since April, squandered one of Wall's best performances. Wall, the No. 1 overall pick in 2010, was determined to not get upstaged by an undrafted upstart and led the Wizards with 29 points and six assists. He showed more confidence in his perimeter jumper as he did a crossover dribble and buried a shot over Lin, and later threw down an emphatic slam over Lin on a fast break in the third quarter.
Lin was undeterred and responded a few minutes later in the third with an unexpected driving dunk that gave the Knicks a 72-66 lead and brought the fans out of their seats. 
"I know how good he is," Wall said of Lin. "If you're a guard that can run the floor and penetrate the floor pretty good with the team with the way Coach [Mike] D'Antoni runs his offense, and that's what he's doing right now."
With seemingly more than half of the arena responding to every movement from Lin or any other Knicks player, the Wizards faced the daunting task of trying to win in Madison Square South - and they wilted. 
Booker had 17 points, but no other Wizard scored in double figures. Nick Young and Crawford combined to score just 14 points on 5-for-21 shooting. JaVale McGee had eight points, nine rebounds and three blocked shots, but he was limited to 20 minutes as he spent most of the night in foul trouble and appeared helpless trying to keep up with Chandler and Lin. 
"We're a family here, you get your jerseys on and go out and play," Wall said. "We knew who they had and who they didn't have. They took advantage of us.They were pretty tough to stop."

Going Out Guide's family movie reviews

BYLINE: Jane Horwitz

SECTION: WEEKEND; Pg. T34

LENGTH: 899 words

8

and older
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island (PG). This movie is too brightly colored and silly to be very scary, even though it's in 3-D. Most kids 8 and older, and even some a little younger, will have fun with it. Sean believes all of Jules Verne's science-fiction fantasies. His stepfather, Hank, helps him decode a radio message with coordinates for the Mysterious Island, which Verne described in his novel of the same name. Hank takes Sean to the South Pacific, where they hire a helicopter pilot whose teenage daughter makes Sean tongue-tied. The chopper flies into a hurricane and crashes onto an island where elephants are tiny and hummingbirds are huge. They have a series of adventures until they realize the island is sinking.
THE BOTTOM LINE: Kids 8 and younger may be scared when the protagonists are chased by giant lizards and hummingbirds. Flying into the hurricane is also a little frightening. Underwater scenes are tense, and a volcano erupts. There is very mild toilet humor and sexual innuendo. 

10

and older
Big Miracle (PG).ג[#x20ac][#x201a]This 1980s true story, based on news accounts and a 1989 book, could have been a treacly, unchallenging "family film." Instead, it's a sharply defined, lightly comic slice of Americana for anyone 10 or older. The story is about three whales trapped under ice off the coast of Alaska, and the film examines the political and philosophical fault lines of the Reagan era as different people work together to save the whales.
THE BOTTOM LINE: The strongest element for kids will be the sheer suspense about whether the whales will survive. The script contains some salty language. Spoiler alert: There is one whale death. We don't see it happen, but we do see its injured snout and hear its labored breathing.

PG-

13
The Woman in Black.ג[#x20ac][#x201a]Based on a novel by Susan Hill, this movie is a well-made throwback - a handsome rendering of a ghost story set in Victorian England. Many high-schoolers will revel in its rich atmosphere and shriek-inducing ghostly visits. That overall spookiness may be too much for middle-schoolers. In a prologue, we see three girls jump to their deaths, seemingly hypnotized by the spirit of the title. Years later, lawyer Arthur Kipps has come to the village to settle a dowager's estate. He is determined to get to the bottom of the ghostly mystery.
THE BOTTOM LINE: The film depicts ghostly spirits, many of them children. Children are led to their deaths by the Woman. A spirit reenacts a hanging suicide, and other flashbacks show a child drowned. We see bloody sheets where Arthur's wife died in childbirth. Characters drink.
Chronicle.ג[#x20ac][#x201a]On a whim, three high school boys explore an unusual cave in this cleverly made sci-fi saga, and the telekinetic powers they develop after their exposure to an unearthly material there leads them first to fun and then to tragedy. "Chronicle" is an absorbing adventure but perhaps too violent and emotionally tortured for middle-schoolers, despite its rating.
The bottom line: One of the boys lashes out violently. The violence is not graphic, but it is loud, fast and upsetting. One incident involves an impalement. Characters use occasional profanity, and it's implied that teens drink beer. One boy's dad is usually drunk; his mother is on oxygen and looks very ill.
One for the Money.ג[#x20ac][#x201a]Katherine Heigl is bumbling bounty hunter Stephanie Plum in this comedy/crime thriller. Though rated PG-13, the movie contains a lot of crudely implied sexual humor, and some rough gun violence nears R range, so it's not for middle-schoolers. High-schoolers may find it puzzling, as it never locks onto a particular tone, beginning in a sort of offbeat Coen brothers style, then wandering into farce and back again.
The bottom line: The script includes a lot of midrange profanity, occasionally stronger stuff and sexual innuendo with briefly implied nudity. The gunplay gets intense in a couple of scenes. Characters drink and handle a shipment of heroin.

R
Safe House.ג[#x20ac][#x201a]High school movie fans 15 and older will be carried along by sheer adrenaline in this deliberately convoluted, breathlessly nonstop spy saga. Matt, a young CIA operative, runs a safe house in Cape Town. Matt longs to prove himself to his superiors back at CIA headquarters. His life changes when an "extraction team" brings in Tobin Frost, a former agent who has been selling state secrets for cash. Unidentified assassins are close on Frost's tail. Matt takes Frost on the run, never knowing whether Frost will try to kill him.
THE BOTTOM LINE: The violence in "Safe House" is constant. In one scene, agents use waterboarding on Frost. The level of on-screen gore is somewhat understated for the R rating, but there's still plenty of blood. The script contains rare barnyard profanity. We see Matt in the shower with his girlfriend, but there is no sexual situation or nudity.
W.E.ג[#x20ac][#x201a]A present-day Manhattanite named Wally Winthrop becomes obsessed with Wallis Simpson, the (in)famous love of King Edward VIII. The movie, conceived and directed by Madonna, toggles between the abused Winthrop and the scandalous marriage between Wallis and Edward that threatened the British monarchy. This is an R-rated movie and probably more for older teens.
The bottom line: There are some pretty disturbing scenes of marital abuse, one involving nudity. Also lots of smoking and some language.

Yeardley Love wasn't alone

BYLINE: Melinda Henneberger

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A02

LENGTH: 892 words

DATELINE: CHARLOTTESVILLE

CHARLOTTES-vILLE                   - Today's color is gray.
Yes, the judge in the murder trial of University of Virginia lacrosse player George Huguely V ruled that relatives and friends of the girlfriend he stands accused of killing, Yeardley Love, had to leave the supportive "Love" bracelets and other memorabilia at home. So they've found another way to fly the flag for her, showing up in pink for jury selection, turquoise for opening arguments and slate on Thursday.
The visual result is a particularly female form of dissent: In the front row, Yeardley's mother, Sharon, never peels off her gray car coat, though it's not chilly in the courtroom. Beside her, older daughter Lexie, who celebrated her 28th birthday by testifying for the prosecution, is in gray silk and following every word uttered in court. Behind them, several rows packed with female cousins, friends and former U-Va. women's lacrosse teammates in gray sweaters and scarves glare at the defendant en masse as he whispers to his female attorney. 
The scene says a lot about Yeardley: that she was part of a close family, community and team. And it says a little about women allegedly abused by their partners: Not all, as we sometimes think, are isolated and trapped at home, without skills, confidence or a way out. 
Working with women coming out of abusive relationships at a nonprofit social service agency in San Francisco's Mission District right out of college, I saw women of all backgrounds and dispositions walk in the door. Many, yes, had been trapped for decades, conditioned to believe they couldn't make it on their own. But one of my favorite clients was a plus-size, tough-talking truck driver and former prostitute who might not have struck you as vulnerable. And on a recent Post front page we were reminded that such abuse happens in all socioeconomic groups: Washington socialite Viola Drath, whose shape-shifting, tale-telling husband has been implicated in her death, stayed with him in part, reportedly, because she was afraid to be alone.
But Love, 22 when she died, was a strong young woman, an excellent student and lifelong athlete who excelled at soccer, gymnastics and field hockey while growing up in Baltimore. And unlike those women who don't know whom to call or whether they'll be believed, Yeardley couldn't have been more fully supported.
Her mother, who let out one small sob and pushed her glasses up her nose when asked on the witness stand how she'd learned of her girl's death, testified that they spoke every day. Yeardley lived with two roommates and seems to have traveled in a pack, constantly surrounded by friends and other members of the women's lacrosse team.
Despite all that, she continued to see, on and off, a young man who prosecutor Dave Chapman says had her in a chokehold at a February 2010 party - until another guest found him holding her down on his bed. 
Just days before she died, she showed at least one teammate an abusive e-mail she'd received from Huguely that said, "I should have killed you," after he'd heard she'd also become involved with someone else, a lacrosse player from the University of North Carolina.
She'd gotten physical with Huguely at one point, too, apparently, hitting him with her purse after hearing that he'd been seeing another girl. And defense attorneys take every opportunity to paint Yeardley as an imperfect victim, asking her friends on the witness stand whether they remember her doing tequila shooters -  "No, sir" - or whether she shared with her teammates her unlovely response to the "I should have killed you" e-mail, though it seems tame under the circumstances: "You are so [messed] up."
Huguely is watchful in court, licking his lips, pulling on his tie, rubbing his hands over his chin. But the Landon grad is an excellent defendant, never smiling at the small jokes from the judge and attorneys that let others in the room release some of their tensions. He lets nothing register on his gaunt face. Friends say he's lost at least 40 pounds since his arrest and looks nothing like his far more imposing former self. "He was a big dude,'' an acquaintance tells me.
Prosecutors contend that he stomped up the steps to Yeardley's apartment just before midnight on May 3, 2010, kicked in her bedroom door, beat her head against the wall and on his way out grabbed her laptop - with the evidence of his threateninge-mail on it. 
Even in the version of events offered by his attorneys, he did drink too much, he did write the threatening e-mail, he did go to her apartment on the night she died and they did fight - but he didn't seriously hurt her. 
Though the autopsy indicates she died of blunt trauma to the head, the defense theory is that she coincidentally expired that night, possibly of a previously undiscovered arrhythmia brought on by the ADD drug Adderall. Oh, and he swiped that computer on his way out on a whim, hoping that mischief would provoke her into calling him the next morning. Your witness.
For all those heartbroken young women in the courtroom wearing gray and leaning forward, I so wish there were a moral to the story, a lesson to take away from the tragedy.
Unfortunately, there isn't always one of those - other than once violence starts, run and never look back, though no exit is any guarantee.

ALMOST, MAINE
At 1st Stage through Feb. 26
The whimsy is laid on with a trowel in "Almost, Maine," John Cariani's evening of interlocking playlets about the travails and magic of young love. A talented young cast backed by an inventive design team has sporadic success cutting through the emotional peanut butter that is the script. Director Michael Chamberlin and his actors might have done better to work a little against the play's grain instead of approaching it with so much wide-eyed wonder. The opening scene sets the tone: Two love-besotted young people (Jessica Shearer and Elliott Kashner) cavort in the snow in slow motion, then remark upon the stars. In the next scene, a hiker (Megan Dominy) arrives at an old farmhouse intending to camp nearby and view the Northern Lights. The homeowner (Jonathan Lee Taylor) falls instantly in love with her and plants a surprising kiss on her lips. It all gets to be a bit much pretty fast. The surfeit of cuteness aside, there are a few lovely moments  that allow the cast to shine and director Chamberlin to show a certain nimbleness with a cloying script.

BLOOD WEDDING
At Source through March 4
Ah, the high ceremony and doom of Federico Garcia Lorca's "Blood Wedding": You can hear it in the opening notes of Mariano Vales's original music for Constellation Theatre's new production. Behzad Habibzai plucks his flamenco guitar and you sit up straight, as if you've just heard a rattlesnake's warning. It turns out to be a false alarm, for this "Blood Wedding" slacks off almost as soon as it begins. Lorca's 1933 tragedy chronicles irresistible passion and a deep family feud, and it does so in a high poetic style that eludes much of this show. The characters are archetypes: the severe Mother, the handsome Groom, the furtive young Bride, etc. Only Leonardo, the hot-tempered rival for the Groom's fiance, has a name. The fable is a sequence of small moments and grand gestures, but the size and suddenness of Lorca's style hasn't really been mastered by director Shirley Serotsky and her cast.

ELECTILE DYSFUNCTION: THE KINSEY SICKS FOR PRESIDENT! (BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT'S HARD BEING A REPUBLICAN)
At Theater J through Feb. 19
Can dragapella save a presidential campaign that suddenly seems to be hitting the skids, entertainment-wise? The Kinsey Sicks hope so. The Sicks are four men in red-white-and-blue drag, a "beauty shop" quartet singing a cappella parodies. Their new show is a mock political rally pushing the red-meat buttons of the right as this frisky foursome tries to become the first corporation to win the White House. It's a show in which Mitt Romney is gleefully referred to as Mitzi. So what's not to like? The non-singing bits, as it turns out. The songs are marvels: They're pun-filled and sung in four-part harmony with a good deal of wit in the arrangements. Picture lanky Irwin Keller as Winnie, dolled up in a conservative skirt and cat's-eye glasses and singing the deep "oompah oompah" bass lines in the harmonies. When Keller's Winnie lets loose in soulful solos, it's a hoot.

THE GALLERIST
At Atlas Performing Arts Center through Feb. 19
So, was the comely Selena Featherstone possessed by a pygmy capuchin monkey named Iago? Not the sort of question one wrestles with on a typical night out. But then "The Gallerist" strives mightily to avoid any contact with the typical. A fusion of gothic horror, Freudian intrigue and lesbian romance, Fengar Gael's drama, in a world premiere by Rorschach Theatre, is tantalizingly oddball, though it would seem to require a more effervescent treatment than director Catherine Tripp's often-muted approach allows. Selena's modern-day descendant, the seriously creepy Bertram Plover, narrates the story of Selena from a New York jail cell. A century earlier in London, Selena's mother beseeches Selena's cousin Laura to allow Selena to live with her after Selena massacres a roomful of her family's pet birds. Laura, an artist who's ditched by her snooty art-critic boyfriend after he decides she's talentless, takes Selena in and begins to paint the birds Selena describes from memory - paintings that will end up in Plover's hands 100 years on. Louise Schlegel and Blair Bowers have by far the most demanding roles, made trickier by the scenes in which Selena, in "Exorcist" style, must seem to spew Iago's verbal bile. They both hold their own in a promising piece that manages to go out on a limb and yet still feels as if it could be allowed to venture out a little bit further.

NECESSARY SACRIFICES
At Ford's Theatre through Feb. 18
At Ford's Theatre Museum, decorous glass-cased displays and solemn recorded voices chronicle the presidency of Abraham Lincoln. Whiffs of the exhibits' earnest, tidily instructive aura also cling to "Necessary Sacrifices," the drama about Lincoln and Frederick Douglass that's onstage one floor up from the museum. Recalling two documented meetings between the president and the abolitionist in 1863 and 1864, Richard Hellesen's idea-packed drama is so carefully informative and so neatly packaged that you exit feeling as if you've racked up an AP History credit, rather than experienced a piece of art. That's not to say that "Necessary Sacrifices," commissioned by Ford's and directed by Jennifer L. Nelson, lacks engaging or affecting moments. The author of three other historical plays produced by Ford's - "One Destiny," "The Road From Appomattox" and the walking tour "Investigation: Detective McDevitt" - Hellesen has seeded this research-based script with colorful Civil War details and anchored it to a lively, often humorous portrait of the president. Fleshing out the portrait is David Selby, an actor who's an old pro at this particular game, having depicted Honest Abe in Ford's "The Heavens Are Hung in Black," as well as in "Lincoln and James," which Selby wrote himself.

gNEXT FALL
At Round House Theatre through Feb. 26
The emotional stakes are high in Geoffrey Nauffts's "Next Fall," an intimate tragicomedy about love, faith and death. Thanks to a gifted cast and a sensitive director in Mark Ramont, the emotional rewards are high for audiences, as well. This is not to say that the Tony-nominated play and Round House's new production unfold flawlessly. Yet the figurative punch in the sternum that theater lovers long for happens at this show in spades. And that's saying something. The play opens with all the characters save one gathering in a care unit of a New York hospital. Luke, a rising young stage actor, has had an accident and lies in a coma. In the waiting room we meet his friend Holly (Dawn Ursula), a new-age-type candle shop owner; his friend and perhaps onetime lover, the uptight Brandon (Alexander Strain); and his voluble, up-from-trailer-trash mother, Arlene (Kathryn Kelley), long divorced from but still squabbling with Butch (Kevin Cutts), his Christian fundamentalist father. Dashing in from the airport is Adam (Tom Story), Luke's lover of four years. Nauffts tells the story of Adam and Luke's relationship in flashbacks. Yet this is a match most certainly not made in heaven.

gAMELIA, A STORY OF ABIDING LOVE
At Undercroft Theatre, Mount Vernon Place United Methodist Church, through Sunday
A corner of the Civil War comes vividly to life in this Washington Stage Guild production, which is about as far from cutting-edge theater as you can get. It is, instead, a trip back in time powered by good words, deft acting and clear direction. With his crystalline staging of the play, Artistic Director Bill Largess does extremely well by actor/playwright Alex Webb. Only two actors populate the small stage - Shirleyann Kaladjian as the title character, and Webb as everyone else. In one sense, the play is a showcase for Webb's chameleon-like acting skills. But tour de force showcase or not, Webb has written a lovely script and found a feisty acting partner in Kaladjian, to whom he is married in real life. She's all sharp edges and strong opinions - a steely 1861 Pennsylvania farm girl whose refusal to flirt or flatter could doom her to spinsterhood. It is her luck and her tragedy that she finds love. Then war breaks out, and her man joins up. Clad in the uniform of a dead Union soldier, Amelia slogs southward to find him, even letting herself be taken prisoner. "Amelia" is a rather staid piece of theater, and its final scene loses an emotional coup de grace by ending too quickly. Yet the Stage Guild's handsome production is highly affecting overall.

ELEPHANT ROOM
At Arena Stage through Feb. 26
"Elephant Room," written and performed by Steve Cuiffo, Geoff Sobelle and Trey Lyford, would look far more comfortable in some ramshackle, claustrophobic space, where its raw aesthetics and ironic sensibility might not pose the glaring counterpoint that it does to refined surroundings. As it is, the 70-minute show comes across as a thin - and occasionally downright sloppy - riff on the sorry state of that quaint staple of birthday parties and down-market casinos, the professional magician. Or is the magic rickety by design? It's ultimately not transparent, for instance, whether the three performers intend here to demystify magic, mock it or honor it. If all these guys are doing is making us feel silly for having believed, then "Elephant Room" is a meaner-spirited piece than I'm allowing for. In any event, it's probably the kind of entertainment best viewed by an audience in an altered state. Because in one's right frame of mind, the show reveals it has very little up its sleeve.

THE GAMING TABLE
At Folger Theatre through March 4
Folger Theatre further expands Washington's classical borders with this send-up of 18th-century social probity by the Restoration-comedy playwright Susanna Centlivre. Name doesn't ring a bell? That's partly why this piquant dish, mounted with considerable aplomb by director Eleanor Holdridge and dressed to the sensational nines by Jessica Ford, comes with a side of pleasant discovery. With its employment of rhyming couplets and laughter at the expense of decadent aristocracy, it subscribes to many of the theatrical and satirical conventions of its time. But it also seems, to some unusual degree, to assert the right of women to aspirations other than marriage. Given the large number of romantic couplings, the construction of the comic architecture does take a bit of forbearance. But Holdridge does a good job holding it together, in the harmonizing of the visual and narrative elements. And Ford's gorgeous gowns imbue the physical production with a soignee irresistibility. The energy and design savvy applied to Centlivre stimulate an appetite for more work by people you didn't know existed.

gLA CAGE AUX FOLLES
At Kennedy Center's Eisenhower Theater through Sunday
Christopher Sieber and George Hamilton, who play a lovingly bickering (un)married couple headlining and running a risque Riviera nightclub, form an appealing comic union. As dashing major-domo Georges, the 72-year-old Hamilton manages to shelve for the occasion the self-regarding rake of old and to portray with charm and dignity the cooler-headed half of a gay couple. Sieber has the requisite big presence for Albin, an old-line drag star. The musical tends to go all mushy, especially in the handling of Albin's rejection by the boy he and Georges raised, Jean-Michel, on the day Jean-Michel is bringing home for the first time his fiancee, her timid mother and homophobic politician father. There are some bona fide lump-in-the-throat moments, courtesy of Sieber and the authentic emotional dive Albin takes after the champagne bubble of his maternal role is initially burst, and Jean-Michel says he doesn't want Albin at the dinner with his fiancee and her parents. Hamilton's lightness of being is an aid here, as he winningly conveys the notion of a man trying to juggle the loyalties in his life while maintaining a sense of Gallic bonhomie. And the overall fitness of this touring version reinforces "La Cage's" place in musical theater as a melodic homage to families of all stripes.

LAUGHTER ON THE 23RD FLOOR
At Church Street Theater through Feb. 18
So seven guys and a gal walk into a dumpy office in Manhattan, dip into the coffee, bagels and Danish, and start crackin' wise. They write sketches for a hit 1950s TV show starring someone very much like Sid Caesar, but who's called Max Prince. Their raucous yet intimate staging is, with few minor exceptions, well cast and performed with the kind of clockwork timing that a Neil Simon script requires. Our guide through the chaos is Lucas, presumably based on the young playwright, a wannabe writer hired by Prince on a trial basis. We meet the other writers as they amble, saunter or shlump into work. Angst burbles between the laughs in Simon's play. Who knew that Keegan Theatre, a company better known for staging Irish and American melodramas, and more recently musicals, could dive into Neil Simon at his shtickiest and come up trumps?

RED
At Arena Stage through March 11
For all its highfalutin discourse, the most engrossing moment of Arena Stage's immensely enjoyable "Red" comes when the two actors dip their brushes into buckets and paint. The activity in which the superbly matched Edward Gero and Patrick Andrews engage, in point of fact, is priming a canvas half again as tall as the two of them. The pleasure of the interlude is in the way it conveys the full, symbiotic immersion of the characters: Gero's Mark Rothko, the vain, abrasive creator of all those mesmerizing canvases of migrating mood and undulating color, and Andrews's Ken, a composite of the assistants who toiled in Rothko's Manhattan studio. Rothko acknowledges anxiety over the pop-art movement that is supplanting abstract expressionism. Ken pricks Rothko's conscience. Both the painter and his assistant know from pain; it's as certain an ingredient in their work as the pigments they mix. Maybe that helps explain why Rothko and his young employee find in the act of priming a canvas a cathartic common pursuit. They don't simply aim to prime that canvas. They want to unleash the Furies on it.

gTHE SNOWY DAY
At Adventure Theatre, Glen Echo Park, through Sunday
It's no surprise that this musical, making its world premiere, turns out to be a different creature from Ezra Jack Keats's Caldecott Medal-winning picture book. Writer David Emerson Toney and composer-lyricist Darius Smith ratchet up Peter's boisterousness quotient and pair him with some quirky acquaintances, including a snow pirate, an anxious snowman and an acrophobic bird who's fond of succotash. With these eccentric companions, the boy plunges into a few mild adventures and a Caribbean-flavored dream. It's a storyline that may strike adult ticketholders as somewhat arbitrarily plotted, but younger audiences will find the production both funny and enthralling. Widely recognized as the first picture book to feature a black child as the central character, Keats's classic featured eye-catching gouache-and-collage illustrations. Echoes of that art show up in the musical. All in all, the play's humor and tunefulness are less satisfying than the picture book's mood of quiet wonder, but the book will always be there for re-reading.

gTIME STANDS STILL
At Studio Theatre through Feb. 19
Why is it that a loving relationship is more apt to withstand bombs than the dormant aftermath? Playwright Donald Margulies poses this question in the steadily engrossing drama performed with the polish of a splendidly synchronized string quartet. The four actors at director Susan Fenichell's keenly realized command apply a completely convincing varnish to the framework of Margulies's story about two journalists returning from harrowing stints in Iraq. James has come home with shattered nerves: The nomadic life of a war correspondent has lost its romance for him. Sarah, a widely admired war photographer, returns gravely injured after a roadside bombing. But she is not, apparently, cured of the job's adrenaline rush. Therein lies the central tension. The play dances on the edge of James's and Sarah's bottled anger, especially as they're forced to confront the warmer, cozier love between their magazine editor and his new, dewy girlfriend. The evening's solid state reaffirms a perception that what Studio puts on its stages these days is all aspiring - and often coming close to - a gold standard.

THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA
At Lansburgh Theatre through March 4
The Shakespeare Theatre Company's entertaining but over-the-top "The Two Gentlemen of Verona" wastes no time coming at you. PJ Paparelli's production of Shakespeare's comedy about double-crossing friends opens in a fast-food parking lot with teenagers engaging in binge drinking. Yes, it's a comedy: The play has two clowns and a dog, and the lovers and friends spend a lot of time swapping witty repartee. But the emotional switchbacks are sharp, and the play's sudden ending threatens real violence. If the show doesn't quite click, it's largely because of its cineplex-style use of U2 tunes and firearms. Music is oxygen in this milieu, of course, but some of the songs are so painfully on the nose as to be eye-rolling. There are "Glee"-spirited moments that will make you laugh, but that's offset by the sense of applying an easy pop patch where the characters or story seem reluctant to fly. But the big test of how you feel about this lively "Two Gents" is how you respond to its violence. Some of the chase scenes and scuffles are fabulous, but this weaponized show repeatedly pushes its kids to extreme moments of despair and self-damage with razors and pistols, making this play darker and more disturbing. In his last plays, Shakespeare used magic and an expansive spirit to make us accept crazy tales. For the rougher "Two Gents," Paparelli gets it done at gunpoint.

Humanitarian crisis deepens in Syrian city after days of siege

BYLINE: Elizabeth A. Kennedy

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A10

LENGTH: 488 words

DATELINE: BEIRUT

BEIRUT - Between blasts of rockets and mortar fire, Syrians used loudspeakers to call for blood donations and medical supplies Thursday in the stricken city of Homs, where a week-long government offensive has created a deepening humanitarian crisis. 
Government forces are trying to crush pockets of violent resistance in Homs, the epicenter of an 11-month-old uprising. The intense shelling in restive neighborhoods such as Baba Amr has made it difficult to get medicine and care to the wounded, and some areas have been without electricity for days, activists say.
"Snipers are on all the roofs in Baba Amr, shooting at people," Abu Muhammad Ibrahim, an activist in Homs, said by phone. "Anything that moves, even a bird, is targeted. Life is completely cut off. It's a city of ghosts."
Hundreds of people are believed to have been killed since early Saturday in the heaviest attack the city has endured since the uprising began in March, activists said.
Human Rights Watch said that eyewitness accounts, as well as video reviewed by the New York-based group's arms experts, suggest that Syrian government forces are using long-range, indirect-fire weapons such as mortars.
The wounded have overwhelmed makeshift hospitals and clinics, and there were growing concerns that the locked-down city could soon run out of supplies.
 "There is medicine in the pharmacies, but getting it to the field clinics is very difficult," Mohammed Saleh, a Syria-based activist, said.
Baba Amr, he said, has been without electricity since Saturday.
The assault on Homs began after reports that army defectors and other armed opponents of President Bashar al-Assad were setting up their own checkpoints and taking control of some areas. The reports could not be confirmed.
The city is the capital of Syria's largest province, stretching from the Lebanese border to the Iraqi frontier. If rebel forces keep gaining ground there, some believe they could ultimately carve out a zone akin to Benghazi in eastern Libya, where rebels launched their successful uprising against Moammar Gaddafi last year.
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and the Local Coordination Committees were trying to compile numbers and names of those killed Thursday. The LCC, an activist group, said as many as 100 people were killed in Homs, but the toll was impossible to independently verify. The observatory reported 46 deaths in Homs.
Activists also reported violence in the towns of Zabadani and Daraa.
Also Thursday, the State Department dispatched its top Mideast envoy, Jeffrey Feltman, to Morocco, France and Bahrain to help organize the inaugural meeting of the "Friends of Syria," with a view to exploring ways that the United States and its European and Arab allies can further isolate Assad and support his foes. Arab League foreign ministers are due to meet Sunday in Cairo and could announce a date and venue for the meeting after that.

See all the nominees before casting a vote

SECTION: WEEKEND; Pg. T04

LENGTH: 503 words

Academy Award purists - those who insist on actually watching all of the nominees, even in the obscure categories, before submitting their ballots - should check out these programs of Oscar-nominated short films opening Friday. Among the roster of mini-movies are ones likely to make you laugh and others likely to make you cry. But either way, they're also likely to increase your odds of winning the office pool. All programs are unrated. 
- Michael O'Sullivan
ANIMATED
If one word could describe the overall tone of the five candidates this year, it would be "poetic."
Especially lovely are "The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore" - a nostalgic fantasia about the transportive joy of reading - and "Sunday," an old-fashioned, hand-drawn entry that follows the idle activities of a small-town boy. Along with "Wild Life," the latter is one of two films produced by the National Film Board of Canada, an animation powerhouse.
Another powerhouse, Pixar, has an entry as well. Called "La Luna," the nearly seven-minute charmer by Italian director Enrico Casarosa is the studio's longest theatrical short ever. Look for it at screenings of the upcoming animated feature "Brave."
At Landmark's E Street Cinema. Contains cartoon roadkill and other animated animal death, a bloody zombie and thematic material related to death. Unrated. 79 minutes. 
LIVE ACTION
Ranging from 11 minutes to a half-hour - and in star power from Ciaran Hinds to a long list of nobodies - the live-action shorts are also a mixed stylistic bag. Among the best of the bunch is surely "Raju," a powerful and well-acted drama about a German couple who adopt, and then proceed to lose, a 4-year-old Indian boy in Kolkata. 
At the other end of the spectrum is "Time Freak," a single-punch-line comedy about a neurotic inventor of a time machine.
Hinds stars in "The Shore" as an emigre Irishman returning home to reconcile with a childhood friend. It's one of two films from the Emerald Isle, along with "Pentecost," which kind of requires that you be Catholic and/or obsessed with soccer to understand.
At Landmark's E Street Cinema. Contains brief obscenity, a mild drug reference and thematic material related to death. Unrated. 107 minutes.
DOCUMENTARY
The opening footage of "The Tsunami and the Cherry Blossom," featuring amateur video of last year's tsunami on the east coast of Japan, could make a stone cry. But so could listening to Ethan McCord, the former soldier whose first-hand account of the 2007 shooting of Iraqi civilians and others by Apache attack helicopters - infamously released by WikiLeaks - forms the heart of "Incident in New Baghdad."
Be forewarned: This year's program is especially heavy, and includes "Saving Face," a doc about a plastic surgeon working to reconstruct the faces of Muslim acid-attack victims. Because of rights issues, "God Is the Bigger Elvis" - the story of a movie starlet-turned-nun - will be not be screened 
At the West End Cinema. Contains brief obscenity and grisly war images. Unrated. 130 minutes.

Adoption clausepasses Senate
The Virginia Senate voted Thursday for a bill to allow private adoption and foster-care agencies to turn away parents for reasons of religious faith or sexual orientation.
Passage of the "conscience clause" bill, by a 22 to 18 vote, was expected, coming one day after it cleared a close preliminary vote. It had support Thursday from all 20 Republican senators in the evenly divided chamber as well as from two conservative Democrats, Sen. Charles J. Colgan of Prince William and Sen. Phillip P. Puckett of Russell.
The House voted overwhelmingly for its version of the bill last week. Gov. Robert F. McDonnell (R), who has often said that faith-based organizations should be free to set their own policies, is expected to sign the legislation.

Officers haunted by fatal shootings in the line of duty

BYLINE: Allison Klein;Matt Zapotosky;Josh White

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A01

LENGTH: 2046 words

Takoma Park police Lt. Tyrone Collington yelled to the masked bank robber to drop his gun and loosen his grip on the teller's neck. It's not worth it, man. Let the girl go, he shouted.
In an instant, as television cameras rolled, the robber slipped on a patch of ice, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTiqdWDui0-URL-the hostage broke free, the robber raised his gun and Collington fired.
"I had to muster all of my skills and my courage to save this life," said Collington, who was the first of six officers to shoot the gunman that morning in a snowy parking lot. "But I also had to take a life."
There has been an unusual spate of fatal police shootings over the past year in the Washington region - 18 cases in which officers killed suspects in 2011, more than four times as many as in the previous year, when there were four. 
Cops shooting bad guys are a mainstay of police television dramas. But in real life, that moment of confrontation is extraordinarily rare. When it does come, the emotional toll can last forever.
Those who kill in the line of duty often have daunting personal and professional hurdles to overcome. They pull the trigger to protect themselves and others, then live in isolation, suspicion and personal sadness as their actions are scrutinized and investigated, often very publicly.
In rare and poignant interviews with The Washington Post, four area police officers who have killed suspects in justified shootings spoke of the torment.
"I still pray for her and her family," said Prince George's Lt. Dan Sheffield, who fatally shot a 16-year-old girl who pointed a gun at him during a standoff in 1996.
Some of last year's police-involved shootings passed with little attention; others captivated the region, such as the Takoma Park case, which was broadcast live as the drama unfolded on Jan. 28, 2011.
Collington was outside the bank with dozens of other officers when he saw the robber, http://voices.washingtonpost.com/crime-scene/montgomery/montgomery-county-police-on-mo.html-URL-Carlos Rudolfo Espinoza Arcia, walk out with a gun to the teller's head. Arcia told authorities that he also had a bomb strapped to his chest.
Collington, head of the criminal investigations division, had seen the teller before because he banks at that Capital One branch.
He remembers her pleading: "Please, don't let me die. I don't want to die."
He felt focused and confident, and he told himself that he was going home that night.
"I'm thinking about my family," said Collington, 45. "I have two kids."
When the hostage broke free, Arcia raised his gun toward her. Collington and five other officers fired. Arcia was shot 13 times, twice by Collington.
Officers found out later that there was no bomb attached to Arcia's chest - just a sham made of sponges and duct tape - and that his gun was not loaded.
"Why he didn't drop the gun, I have no clue," Collington said, reflecting on the shooting. "Once I got home, those first few nights were sleepless. You're thinking about the guy's family, the victim, the investigation you're facing."

Life-or-death moment
D.C. Police Chief Cathy L. Lanier said no police officer wants to use deadly force. "It's very traumatic emotionally for the officers. It's devastating," she said.
None of the officers who shot and killed someone in 2011 has been charged with a crime, but even when the shooting is justified, it is difficult to take a life.
About 95 percent of police officers who carry guns will never use a firearm, law enforcement experts say. The ones who do often fire in self-defense and then learn that the gun pointed at them was not real or wasn't loaded. But there is no way to know in the split second when it counts.
The life-or-death moment when officers shoot someone is so intense that they often say they never heard the gun fire or they didn't realize they had pulled the trigger more than once. They sometimes feel that time stood still - that a 10-second encounter seemed to last for minutes or longer.
Police don't like to speak publicly about shootings because of the personal nature of the incidents.
But Collington, Sheffield and the others agreed to talk about the shootings and how the experience affected them. Although each incident was ruled justified, the men say it has had a haunting effect.
"It changed my life," Sheffield said. "Once you pull the trigger, it's not over. . . . You don't start running credits."
It was a November day in 1996, and Sheffield and other officers were standing outside a Laurel apartment building as a teenager inside was threatening to shoot people. The officers begged the girl to come out.
When 16-year-old Julie Meade finally appeared, she raised what looked like a handgun at Sheffield and the other officers. Sheffield said he felt "helpless." The officers opened fire, and Meade was killed. Sheffield learned later that the gun was not real.
The shooting was about 15 years ago, but it still weighs on Sheffield. "It's not supposed to work this way," he said.
Across the country in 2010, police killed 387 people in justified homicides, according to FBI statistics. That same year, 153 officers were killed in the line of duty by firearms.
Some cases appear to be clear-cut examples of "suicide by police," in which someone refuses to drop a gun knowing full well that officers will fire.
Others bring widespread outrage, court filings and political blow-back, such as the 2007 death of http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/linkset/2009/04/15/LI2009041502530.html"                 title="www.washingtonpost.com-URL-DeOnte Rawlings. The 14-year-old was http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/metro/interactives/rawlings/?sid=ST2009041801738"                 title="www.washingtonpost.com-URL- pursued and killed by an off-duty D.C. officer who was combing a Southeast neighborhood for his stolen minibike. Rawlings's family sued the city, and the case washttp://www.washingtonpost.com/local/deonte-rawlings-civil-suit-over-fatal-shooting-is-settled/2011/11/02/gIQANcMbCN_story.html-URL- settled out of court last year.
Many, though, are very tense situations in which an officer must make a split-second decision when confronting someone who is willing to kill.
Such was the case involving D.C. Police Sgt. Gerald "GG" Neill. It happened about 17 years ago when Neill was driving near RFK Stadium, heading into work on his day off to fill out timecards for his officers in the gun-recovery unit. Neill talks about it vividly.
Joseph Cooper Jr. flagged Neill down, and the officer stopped to see whether Cooper needed help. When Neill opened his car door, Cooper attacked him, possibly trying to steal the vehicle. The two wrestled in and out of the car in a "life-and-death struggle," Neill said. Neill was losing the fight and felt forced to fire his weapon to save his life.
"Everything seemed to go real slow," Neill said. "Only by the grace of God was I able to survive."
He was angry for months after the incident, wondering why he had been in the wrong place at the wrong time.
"I thought, 'Why me? Why did I get chosen?' I was minding my own business trying to do the right thing," Neill said.
The only people he could talk with about it were his attorney and a psychologist from the department's employee-assistance program. With everyone else, he just tried to mask the trauma.
"People ask how you're doing, and you tell them you're doing fine - but you're not," Neill said.
Neill, 59, retired several years ago after 30 years with the department. He now works for D.C. Protective Services, which provides security for city facilities. He said he doesn't like to talk about the shooting out of respect for the man he killed.
"I empathize with his family. He was a father, a brother, a son," Neill said. "It's sad all the way around. It's tough."
"I came back to work quickly, which was good," said Neill, who was not permitted to carry a gun for a year. "The worst thing you can do is sit at home and do nothing."
It had such a profound effect on his life that he became president of the D.C. police union so he could speak out for officers who found themselves in similar situations.
"You know what they're going through. You know they're being isolated," Neill said. "They'll say it's just part of the job, but you know they don't mean that. You say a little prayer and hope they'll be okay."

Someone he knew
Steve Hudson joined the Prince William County police force in 1982. He had been with the police department for seven years - and on the county's SWAT team for five - before he saw a police officer fire at a suspect.
It wasn't until years later, Jan. 14, 1996, that Hudson learned how difficult it is. In his case, he killed someone he knew.
It was shortly after 6 p.m. when a 911 call came from a home in Triangle, a house that was familiar to Hudson because it belonged to a friend who was a sheriff's deputy. Hudson decided to hurry to the scene.
Upon Hudson's arrival, Jimmy Lloyd, 32, stumbled out of the house, and Hudson recognized him as his friend's son. He saw that Lloyd was carrying a handgun and an extra magazine of ammunition.
Lloyd fired two shots into the pavement and then walked slowly toward Hudson.
Hudson, now an assistant chief in charge of criminal investigations, keeps a yellowed piece of paper in one of his files. It contains notes of what went through his mind that night, thoughts he wrote down days later because he wanted to show how much of his classroom training and job experience figured into those critical moments.
But Hudson doesn't need to refer to the paper, as he recounts his reflections as if the shooting happened yesterday: 15 things he thought of in less than 80 seconds.
He didn't want to negotiate too long with an irrational shooter, because he didn't want to put other officers at risk. He measured the distance at about 25 yards, a shot he could easily take. He drew an imaginary line in the road - a point at which Hudson's supervisor would have been dangerously exposed to a shooter. That would be as far as he would let Lloyd go.
Officers with Hudson later reported that he said: "Don't make me do this. Don't make me do this." But Hudson doesn't remember what he said because he was so focused.
When Lloyd crossed the line, Hudson pulled the trigger on his Glock, killing Lloyd with a bullet through the heart.
"I was afraid, but there had to be a line, and I knew where it was," Hudson said. "He crossed it. I couldn't risk him killing me or my guys."
Hudson rushed up to Lloyd - splayed on his back - and kicked the gun away. He felt himself screaming at him.
"I was angry at him for forcing my hand," Hudson said. "I didn't feel bad about the decision, because I knew it was the right thing to do. But it bothered me that I had killed someone. I didn't want him to die. I felt really bad that he was dead, that his life had to end there that night."
It turned out that Lloyd was heavily intoxicated. The reason for the 911 call was that Lloyd had been firing the weapon inside the house, where his mother, his wife and two of his children were cowering.
"You do all these things to prepare and train yourself to make the right decisions, and ultimately you have to take a man's life," Hudson said.
Hudson felt a responsibility to tell Lloyd's father what had happened, and there was an emotional encounter between the two men.
"I told him I had to shoot Jimmy and that Jimmy was dead," Hudson said. "He grabbed me and hugged me and said, 'God bless you.' I think he knew I was upset I had to kill him."
Hudson later went to Internal Affairs as a commander, a job in which he investigated police shootings. And he has lectured recruits during a "Dynamics of Armed Encounters" class, using the notes on his yellowed paper to help explain the thought processes involved in life-or-death situations.
"I tell the officers involved that they will second-guess themselves, they will have dreams, they might get depressed," Hudson said. "They just have to know that's normal. Being able to talk to them having been in their shoes, it makes a lot of difference. It's not easy to kill someone. But I know that if I have to do that, I can do that."

Giffords aide to run for House seat she vacated
Ron Barber, an aide to former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.), will run for the House seat she just left. 
Barber, 66, was Giffords's district director from her election in 2007 until she retired last month. He was shot twice, once in the face and once in the leg, in the Tucson rampage that left six dead and nearly killed his boss.
"Our community needs someone who will put politics aside and solve problems for the people of Southern Arizona," he said in a statement. "My commitment is to be honest with the people of this district and help restore civility to our public life."
He has Giffords's support in the primary, and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Steve Israel (N.Y.) sent an e-mail calling Barber "a good friend."
State Rep. Matt Heinz is also running, but Barber told reporters that he hoped that his rival would step aside.
"We have a very strong bond. I know what her priorities are," Barber said of his former boss in a conference call with reporters Thursday afternoon. "I'm a moderate like she is."
The special election for Giffords's 8th District seat will take place June 12. An election for what will become the 2nd District after redistricting will occur this fall.
Barber's announcement left unclear whether he would run in November or would serve as a placeholder, as some news organizations have reported.

After closing arguments, Hinckley awaits ruling

BYLINE: Del Quentin Wilber

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B06

LENGTH: 586 words

After 13 days of hearings spread over four months, Secret Service agents, psychologists, psychiatrists, experts, relatives and even a bookstore clerk have opined about would-be assassin John W. Hinckley Jr.'s love life, driving, reading habits and movie reviews.
Now it's up to a federal judge to decide whether that testimony justifies granting the 56-year-old more privileges from the psychiatric hospital where he has lived since being found not guilty by reason of insanity in the shooting of President Ronald Reagan and three other men in 1981.  
In closing arguments Thursday in the District's federal court, attorneys for Hinckley and the government sparred over whether Hinckley remained a danger to himself or others and whether he should be granted longer unsupervised visits to his mother's home town of Williamsburg. 
St. Elizabeths Hospital is asking U.S. District Judge Paul L. Friedman to expand those visits to as long as 24 days. The hospital's doctors also would like the authority to eventually place Hinckley in Williamsburg on a full-time basis. Friedman said he would probably not rule before April or May.
Hinckley's attorney, Barry Wm. Levine, urged Friedman to approve the hospital's proposal because the presidential assailant's mother is 86. 
"Mrs. Hinckley is healthy, but she cannot remain healthy forever," said Levine, a colorful litigator who quoted Upton Sinclair and littered his statements with such phrases as "supercilious swagger," "insubstantial quibble," "misguided stubbornness" and "avalanche of trivia."
Levine told Friedman that Hinckley was no longer a threat to himself or others and insisted his client had done nothing to raise concerns during previous visits to Williamsburg. 
"There is no rational basis to believe he will do anything dangerous," Levine said. 
Federal prosecutors countered that Hinckley remains a risk and should not be granted new privileges because he remains deceptive, has issues with women and has not taken the necessary steps to integrate into the Williamsburg community.
"Mr. Hinckley is in need of more monitoring, not less," said Assistant U.S. Attorney Nihar Mohanty.
Among prosecutors' specific complaints: Hinckley lied to his treatment providers when he gave positive reviews to two movies he had not seen. And prosecutors remain concerned that Hinckley still shows an interest in Reagan and violence. On two visits to bookstores, Secret Service agents caught him browsing shelves that contained books about the president, his assassination attempt and presidential slayings.
Mohanty added that Hinckley has shown poor judgment in his love life, noting that the presidential assailant invited two women to the same party, showed poor judgment in dating a "floridly psychotic" woman and did not tell some of his doctors that he had gotten engaged to a former patient. (Hinckley's love life is a recurring topic because he shot Reagan in the delusional hopes of impressing actress Jodie Foster.)
Levine said the hospital's proposal addresses the government's concerns. In terms of his client's dating habits, Levine said it should come as no surprise that Hinckley tends to find women who have issues. "Who is he going to meet at St. Elizabeths?" Levine asked. "Of course those relationships are not perfect."
Hinckley, wearing a brown sport coat, said nothing during the hearing, though he did whisper several times to Levine and his co-counsel, Michelle Tupper Butler.
Levine later described his client to reporters as "resilient."

Meters for disabled drivers make debut
Drivers in the District this weekend may get their look at a new style of parking meter with a red top.
Throughout February, D.C. traffic control officers will be stationed at the new meters for disabled people to explain who is eligible to park at them and for how long. Meanwhile, parking enforcement officers will be issuing warning notices to those who park at the red-top meters without displaying a valid placard or license plate.
Starting March 1, drivers who park illegally at the meters will be subject to ticketing and towing.

60-year sentencein killing of student
A 20-year-old District man was sentenced to 60 years in prison Friday for killing a 17-year-old honor roll student and injuring another teenager in November 2010, authorities said.
A D.C. Superior Court jury found Kwan Kearney guilty of first-degree murder while armed, assault with intent to kill while armed, aggravated assault while armed and a firearms offense in December.
Joseph Sharps Jr., an athlete at Spingarn High School, was shot and killed in Northeast Washington while walking to buy cigarettes with a friend, according to the U.S. attorney's office.
Kearney bumped Sharps, accused him of pretending to reach for a gun, then shot him three times - and the other teenager once - with a Colt .38-caliber revolver, according to authorities.

D.C. man charged in fatal stabbing
A 55-year-old D.C. man was charged with murder Friday in the stabbing of a transgender person at a Northeast Washington bus stop last week, police said.
The victim, JaParker Jones, 23, who identified as a woman and went by the names Deoni and Logan, was stabbed in the 4900 block of East Capitol Street NE shortly after 8 p.m. Feb. 2. Jones was pronounced dead at a hospital about six hours later. 
Police said the motive for the attack is unclear.
Gary N. Montgomery of Northeast Washington was arrested Friday afternoon by members of a fugitive task force. Police said it appears that Jones and Montgomery were strangers.
At a news briefing, Police Chief Cathy L. Lanier praised two witnesses who tried to help Jones and thanked several tipsters who later gave police information that led to the arrest.

VRE corrects policy on bus transfers
Virginia Railway Express officials say they had incorrect information on their Web site regarding the Fairfax Connector bus transfer policy. 
They say this is the correct information for rail riders seeking to transfer:
A rider with a valid VRE monthly ticket or TLC ticket can transfer for free at a VRE station to a Fairfax Connector bus as long as it's not an express bus. But riders must pay for their return bus trips.

THE EXISTENCE - and, until recently, the rapid proliferation - of congressional earmarks presents a quandary. Lawmakers have a legitimate interest in securing funding for their districts. The Constitution grants Congress the power of the purse, and earmarks reflect the exercise of that authority. On the other hand, the explosion of earmarked spending threatens to elevate political clout over the merits of a project. The existence of earmarks may not increase overall spending, but they may send limited dollars to where they're not most needed. When bridges are crumbling, the country cannot afford bridges to nowhere.  
That background is helpful in assessing the significance of the latest installment of The Post's series "Capitol Assets." Reporters Scott Higham, Kimberly Kindy and David S. Fallis scoured disclosure reports and public records and found 33 lawmakers who had steered more than $300 million in earmarks or other spending to projects located within two miles of properties they own. Equally, if not more troubling, the investigation identified 16 lawmakers who have taken actions benefiting entities connected to their immediate families. The importance of these findings is not necessarily that they demonstrate out-and-out corruption as that they illustrate the inevitable ethical questions intertwined with congressional earmarking.
The report also highlights gaps in current disclosure rules. Currently, and most likely for good reason after the tragic shooting of former representative Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.), lawmakers do not have to provide their home addresses on financial disclosure forms. But certainly it would be reasonable, when lawmakers seek earmarks, to require that they disclose any nearby property holdings or the involvement of family members in the entity receiving the money - not merely to offer blanket certifications that they stand to reap no financial reward. 
Consider the case of Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), who obtained a $900,000 earmark to resurface about two dozen roads in his state - including a quarter-mile residential loop on which he owns a home. Mr. Thompson said he did not ask for his street to be paved; the local mayor, who described Mr. Thompson as a close friend, said the congressman "didn't have anything to do with where the asphalt went." But constituents can't be blamed for wondering if Mr. Thompson, having secured the money for repaving, received preferential treatment.
The findings about lawmakers' relatives working for institutions that benefit from congressional largesse were particularly disturbing.  Rep. Ed Pastor (D-Ariz.) obtained a $1 million grant for at-risk high school students four years before his daughter was hired as its director, and earmarked $4 million more for the program since.
Mr. Pastor said he did not realize that his daughter was applying for the job. If he had, Mr. Pastor told The Post, "I would have contacted the chancellor and said, 'What kind of position does that put you and me in?' " Which is, of course, exactly the question that lawmakers and voters, after reading this series, ought to be asking about the entire earmarking practice.

Lanier: Wireless firms have power to reduce thefts of smartphones

BYLINE: Clarence Williams;Cecilia Kang

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B01

LENGTH: 900 words

Police chiefs everywhere say smartphone robberies are rocketing. They've offered cash rewards, set up decoy crews in subway stations and urged iPhone owners to be wary.  
But the robberies keep coming. Now, police in the Washington area and elsewhere are expressing their frustration in plain terms, publicly asking regulators and wireless-network operators to allow stolen devices to be shut down remotely through unique identification numbers within them. 
That could make it less likely that robbers would point a gun at a victim, knock someone down or grab a smartphone from a Metro rider, officials say, because the device's resale value would plummet. "This is a national issue,"  D.C. Police Chief Cathy L. Lanier said Friday at a news conference. "We have done all we can at the local level." 
Lanier - who says electronics-related crimes have "clobbered" her department  - wants wireless companies to use existing technology to let people who report stolen phones ask their service providers to shut them down using IMEI numbers, a unique registration akin to a fingerprint.   
The United Kingdom uses a similar system, Lanier said, and police officials in the United States are asking federal regulators to urge the industry to implement it here. Lanier has sent a resolution, endorsed by a group ofother big-city police chiefs, to the Federal Communications Commission, asking the government to require mobile companies to "disable stolen mobile devices to deter the commission of these thefts."
"It's a simple way to alleviate it," said Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles H. Ramsey, who is president of the Major City Chiefs Police Association. "Why would [mobile companies] not want to do it?"
Officials are increasingly concerned about crimes involving mobile devices. District police say that about 40 percent of the nearly 500 robberies reported in 2012 involved cellphones, iPods or tablet computers. Metro officials reported a rash of snatch thefts last year, and undercover Metro officers arrested four would-be Apple device grabbers on Wednesday alone. 
In New York, according to the office ofSen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), nearly half of the 16,000 robberies reported to  police in the first 10 months of 2011 were of personal technology - mostly cellphones, with iPhones wildly popular. Other big-city chiefs report similar statistics. 
"It's a big problem here," said Ramsey, who preceded Lanier as the District's chief.  "People have been attacked and knocked down, and thieves go through their pockets looking for these phones - not just for wallets or money."
Police chiefs want the FCC to persuade companies to allow the shutdowns voluntarily   or require it through regulation. Schumer supports the idea and has helped link Lanier and New York police with industry officials to discuss the issue. 
In a telephone interview, Schumer - who sits on the Senate Judicary Committe's subcommittee on privacy, technology and the law - called electronics theft the top crime on New York's subways. If the industry does not act, he said, he will push for a new regulation and might introduce legislation.
"We are pushing the regulators to do this," Schumer said. "We're pushing the companies to do this."
The FCC acknowledges a problem but was noncommital on the chiefs' proposal. "Thefts of mobile devices are growing at an alarming rate, and we are actively working with public safety agencies and wireless carriers on ways to address this issue," FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski said in a statement.
The proposal may meet stiff resistance from wireless carriers. "This isn't the solution, because when you look at other countries that have tried this, it doesn't work," said Amy Storey, spokeswoman for CTIA, the national wireless trade group. 
Police have found organized criminal outfits that ship phones overseas, according to CTIA general counsel Michael Altschul: In San Francisco, investigators found stolen smartphones that were shipped abroad, then reactivated or sold for parts.
"Cellphones are small and very valuable and easy to ship out of one country and resell in another that doesn't have access to a database held by law enforcement or care to access the database," Altschul said. "So the effectiveness of such programs are limited."
Police have other tools at their disposal. D.C. police offer cash rewards of up to $10,000 for information leading to the conviction of someone who has stolen a device or resold a stolen one. And undercover Metro officers look  for would-be robbers on the subway, sometimes posing as sleeping commuters who display cellphones and then swooping in when someone grabs the devices.
Some stolen phones can be tracked using their SIM cards. But SIM cards can be replaced, leaving the phone usable, untraceable and valuable to would-be buyers. Lanier wants to target the market for stolen phones. "What's going to stop this is stopping the profit," Lanier said.
The idea, Lanier says, is not to combat the international export of stolen phones by organized criminals, but to discourage street crimes that put people at risk. 
"I hear 15 stories or so every morning in my crime briefings,"  Lanier said. "We are being clobbered with these robberies, and they're looking for the same thing. They say, 'Give me your purse. Now where is your phone?' "

Police: Robberies in Fairfax County may be linked

BYLINE: Martin Weil

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B04

LENGTH: 168 words

Four armed robberies were committed in residential areas of Fairfax County in a short period Thursday night, and police said all four might be connected. 
The crimes occurred between 10:15 and 11:30 p.m. in an area spanning about eight miles in the southeastern part of the county, below the Capital Beltway, police said. The first three robberies were in the Franconia-Springfield section, the last near the Huntington-Groveton area.
In the first, a 27-year-old woman was robbed in the 6900 block of Kingstowne Village Parkway, police said. Shortly afterward, robbers demanded money from a 22-year-old woman in the 5900 block of Norham Drive, police said. She was allegedly struck with a gun.
Then, a 20-year-old man was robbed and punched in the 6300 block of Dana Avenue and a 25-year-old man was held up in the 6500 block of Quander Road, police said.
In each case, there were three robbers, who were described as black, in their early 20s, about 5-foot-10 and 170 to 200 pounds, police said.

A Navy ship for Giffords
Gabrielle Giffords, the former Arizona congresswoman who survived an assassination attempt one year ago, is getting a Navy vessel named in her honor. 
The Navy said Friday that its newest littoral combat ship, a small, agile surface vessel, will be called the USS Gabrielle Giffords. The ship's sponsor will be Roxanna Green, the mother of Christina-Taylor Green, 9, who was killed in the Tucson shooting that wounded Giffords in January 2011. 
In a statement, Navy Secretary Ray Mabus described Giffords and Roxanna Green as "sources of great inspiration" who "represent the Navy and Marine Corps qualities of overcoming, adapting and coming out victoriously despite great challenges."
According to the Defense Department, the USS Gabrielle Giffords will be the 17th ship to be named for a woman and the 13th to be named after a living person.
The naming of Navy vessels is not always a simple affair. In April 2010, after the service unveiled plans for the USS John P. Murtha, critics lobbied Mabus to reconsider, citing the former congressman's opposition to the Iraq war. This year, the Navy announced plans for the USNS Cesar Chavez, after the labor leader, drawing objections from conservatives.
Giffords attended the Friday event at which the Navy announced its plans. Hours earlier, she had joined President Obama as he signed the last piece of legislation she had authored before her retirement, which grants law enforcement officials greater authority to combat illicit drug trafficking on the border.
"I'm confident that while this legislation may have been her last act as a congresswoman, it will not be her last act of public service," he said in a statement.

Man pleads guilty in plot to kill Obama

BYLINE: Jay Reeves

DATELINE: BIRMINGHAM, ALA.

BIRMINGHAM, Ala. - A man from Uzbekistan who pleaded guilty Friday to plotting to kill President Obama with an automatic rifle claimed he was acting at the direction of an Islamic extremist group in his home country.
Authorities said Ulugbek Kodirov had discussed trying to kill the president as he campaigned for reelection because Obama would be out in public more often. Kodirov entered the plea during a hearing in Birmingham before U.S. District Judge Abdul K. Kallon.
Defense attorney Lance Bell said the 22-year-old Kodirov avoided a potential life sentence by pleading guilty. He faces up to 30 years in prison, although Bell expected Kodirov to receive about half that. The judge also told Kodirov that he will face deportation once he is released from prison. 
The plea agreement said that in July 2011, Kodirov claimed he had been communicating with a person known as "the Emir." Kodirov said the person was a member of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, which has been designated a terrorist organization by the State Department. Authorities did not reveal the identity of the Emir.
The Emir "asked Kodirov if there was anything Kodirov could do about President Obama since Kodirov was closer geographically to the president than the Emir," according to his plea agreement.
Kodirov and a person who helped authorities discussed possible ways to kill Obama, including shooting long distance using a sniper rifle.
The agreement said Kodirov became disheartened when he realized how expensive sniper rifles are, and realized he lacked the skill to pull off the shot. Kodirov then decided he could shoot the president from a closer distance.
 "Kodirov said that he did not care if he got shot and killed, as long as he killed President Obama," according to the plea deal.
Kodirov then struck up a friendship with another person in Birmingham who spoke Uzbek, and the two often attended a mosque there together. The two often looked at jihadist Web sites and videos on Kodirov's laptop computer, the agreement said.
On July 11, after the two went to a mosque in Birmingham to pray, Kodirov asked his friend to buy a gun for him so he could kill Obama.
Kodirov told the person he "knew this was what he was supposed to do for Islam," the plea agreement says.
Kodirov was arrested in July.
Bell, the defense attorney, said Kodirov regrets what happened and "accepted responsibility for the charges he pled guilty to."
He was accused of making four separate threats against Obama within a five-day period when he was meeting either with a witness who went to police or an undercover officer.
U.S. Attorney Joyce Vance said Kodirov's threats were serious enough that law enforcement officers thought they had to intervene.
 "He had developed a plan, he was reaching out to other individuals for aid and acquiring firepower necessary to kill the president," Vance said.
A complaint said that the person Kodirov contacted in early July to buy weapons became a confidential source for the government. Accompanied by the witness, Kodirov purchased a Sendra M115A1 automatic rifle from an undercover agent at a Birmingham  area motel on July 13, when authorities said the final threat was made against the president. The agent also gave Kodirov four hand grenades with the powder removed.
Authorities say Kodirov was in the country illegally because he obtained a student visa but never enrolled in school.
Kodirov pleaded guilty to three counts: threatening to kill the president, possessing an automatic weapon and providing material support to terrorists. Four other charges were dropped as part of the deal.
Uzbekistan is located in central Asia and was once part of the former Soviet Union.

Syrian revolt grows militant

BYLINE: Liz Sly;Greg Miller

LENGTH: 1071 words

DATELINE: BEIRUT

BEIRUT - The daylight assassination on Saturday of a general in the Syrian capital, Damascus, underscored the growing militarization of the uprising against the rule of President Bashar al-Assad, amid concerns that militants affiliated with al-Qaeda may be infiltrating the revolt.
According to the state news agency SANA, Brig. Gen. Issa al-Kholi, who was director of a hospital, was shot to death by three gunmen waiting outside his home in the Rukn Eddin neighborhood, known as an area where anti-government sentiments are strong, in a city that until recently had mostly stood aloof from the violence ravaging much of the rest of the country. 
The Local Coordination Committees, an opposition organization, said 30 people were killed by security forces Saturday as the government sustained its assault in Homs, several rural suburbs of Damascus and a town in the southern province of Daraa, which are among the locations that have fallen under the sway of the rebel Free Syrian Army.
It was not the first time a top official had been gunned down as the 11 -month-old Syrian uprising has gradually evolved into an armed, if disorganized, insurgency. SANA listed the names of eight doctors and scientists who have been slain in recent weeks, and it has in the past reported the killings of top military officials.
But the attack in the center of the normally calm capital, coming a day after twin suicide bombings in the commercial center of Aleppo, heightened a sense of vulnerability to the crisis in the two major cities that have yet to witness large-scale protests.
A spokesman for the Free Syrian Army, an umbrella organization that only loosely represents the assortment of defected soldiers and civilians fighting in its name, said he did not know whether his group had carried out the assassination.
"We are waiting for information and will let you know," said Col. Malik al-Kurdi, contacted by telephone in Turkey, where several dozen defected officers formed the army rebel group last summer. They acknowledge they exert little direct control over its activities on the ground.
His comment illustrated the confusion surrounding the violence in Syria, which is now taking on multiple forms. Hundreds of people, most of them civilians, have been reported killed in the bombardments of residential neighborhoods in Homs that are loyal to the opposition. In other locations, those staging peaceful protests are still being shot. The Free Syrian Army is asserting responsibility for a growing number of attacks on the security forces, and there have been reports of sectarian killings involving civilians as the conflict increasingly divides Syria's Sunni majority from the Alawite minority that controls most key positions in the government.
On Saturday, SANA said 39 members of the police and army were given military funerals after being killed the day before in attacks by "terrorists" in Homs and rural Damascus, signaling the growing impact of the insurgency. Their deaths were apparently in addition to the 28 people killed in the two suicide bombings in Aleppo on Friday. No group has asserted responsibility for the blasts.
The bombings, in the wake of three similar attacks in Damascus, have heightened speculation that militant groups linked to al-Qaeda may be seeking to exploit the chaos to project their own extremist ambitions onto an uprising that started out as a peaceful protest movement demanding change.
The McClatchy news service on Friday quoted U.S. officials as saying that al-Qaeda in Iraq was responsible for two suicide bombings that killed 44 people in Damascus in December, and also, perhaps, for Friday's bombings in Aleppo. Al-Qaeda chief Ayman al-Zawahiri, who is believed to be hiding in Pakistan, ordered operatives of the Iraq-based al-Qaeda affiliate to carry out the attacks, McClatchy said.
Intelligence officials told The Washington Post that although the recent bombings have the hallmarks of al-Qaeda operations, they have found no conclusive link to al-Qaeda or its Iraqi affiliate.
However, the officials said, it is plausible that al-Qaeda, marginalized by the recent uprisings across the Arab world, would attempt to insert itself into the effort to topple the Assad regime.
"It wouldn't be a surprise that al-Qaeda in Iraq - which has operational networks in Syria - would seek to join the opposition and attack the Assad regime," a U.S. official said.
The Syrian government has long accused the protest movement of having ties to al-Qaeda, and it leapt on the suicide bombings as proof that the militant group is involved in the uprising. The opposition has countered with accusations that the government staged the attacks to prove its claims that it is confronting an al-Qaeda threat and to deter the still-remote prospect of international military intervention to oust Assad.
If militants linked to al-Qaeda were to establish a presence in Syria, it would dramatically complicate U.S. efforts to support the Syrian opposition's demands for democracy. The Obama administration says it is looking for ways to bolster the protest movement to hasten Assad's departure, though it acknowledges its options are limited. Senators including John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (I-Conn.) have proposed sending non-lethal aid to the Free Syrian Army.
Al-Kurdi, the Free Syrian Army spokesman, insists that the group has no affiliations to al-Qaeda and would not tolerate its presence in Syria. Though the Free Syrian Army regularly claims responsibility for ambushes against the Syrian security forces, it has denied a role in any of the five suicide bombings in Aleppo and Damascus that U.S. officials have characterized as al-Qaeda-style attacks.
"Al-Qaeda is trying to enter the Syrian scene, it is true," Kurdi said. "But the Free Syrian Army is preparing to stop that. We are going to confront any infiltration by al-Qaeda or any extremist group, because the regime will use it to justify the killing of Syrian people."
U.S. officials cited the recent suicide bombings in Damascus for their decision to close the U.S. embassy there last week, after  Syrian authorities failed to respond to their requests for extra protection for the facility.

Paralyzed in attack, chef stayed on path

John Nucci called himself "the guy who refused to be a victim."
But in 1989, at a time when crime was raging in the District, he was the target of an act of gun violence that shocked Washington and left him paralyzed from the waist down.
Mr. Nucci died Jan. 5 at Washington Hospital Center in the District of complications from the gunshot wounds he suffered 23 years ago. He was 50. The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner ruled his death a homicide. 
On the night of Feb. 28, 1989, between 1 and 2 a.m., the 27-year-old Mr. Nucci had just gotten off work as a sous-chef at the Capital Hilton in downtown Washington. He went for a drink with a woman he was dating.
The couple were walking to a nearby parking lot where Mr. Nucci had left his gray Buick when two men emerged from behind a van. One of them put a gun to Mr. Nucci's head and demanded a ride.
While Mr. Nucci drove, according to news reports, the assailants sexually assaulted his companion in the car. They told Mr. Nucci to go to the Beltway, where they abandoned the woman on the side of the road.
The men then forced Mr. Nucci, at gunpoint, to continue driving around for several hours. He would later tell his family that they ordered him to take them to his family's home in Silver Spring so they could rob his parents.
When he refused, the men ordered him to pull over on the side of the Beltway, just inside Prince George's County near the New Hampshire Avenue exit. They told him to get out of the car. They already had his wallet, and with it his identification and address.
Mr. Nucci threw his keys across the road and tried to flee, but he was shot four times. One of the bullets hit his spine.
The assailants found the car keys and drove away, leaving Mr. Nucci for dead. Before losing consciousness, he crawled onto the road, where a driver spotted him and flagged down a trucker, who used a CB radio to call for help.
"I just said my prayers and went to sleep, and I was awakened by some guy who thought I was drunk until he saw I'd been shot," Mr. Nucci told the Washington Times in 1990.
He was taken to the shock trauma center at the University of Maryland in Baltimore, where doctors did not expect him to live. He had several operations, including one on his heart, which was damaged by a bullet, and underwent intensive rehabilitation with occupational therapists and grief counselors.
In his dreams, he could walk. Two years passed, his sister Elise Nucci Thompson said, before he dreamed about himself in his wheelchair.
Over time, Mr. Nucci built up enough strength to go back to work. With Bob Rood, the owner of the Flaps restaurant chain in Montgomery County, where Mr. Nucci had worked earlier in his career, he started a temporary employment agency for restaurant workers.
But Mr. Nucci had always hoped to open a restaurant of his own. In 1994, he moved from Silver Spring to Leonardtown, in St. Mary's County, where his friends and family helped him start Willows Restaurant and Tavern.
"Because my legs don't work doesn't mean I don't have my life," he told the Washington Times. "Some people are born to be police, some people are born to be priests, and I'm born to be cooking."
Mr. Nucci lived behind the restaurant in a house he renovated and made wheelchair-accessible with help from his friends, including Billy Hayes, his housemate for years. "He was the brains," Hayes said. "I was his legs."
Mr. Nucci cultivated a loyal clientele at the Italian-style restaurant, which served - as he once put it - "everything from bar burgers to pan-seared duck." In a 1999 review, Washington Post food critics Molli and Andy Yood called his cuisine "imaginative yet traditional."
In the kitchen, Mr. Nucci used a customized stand-up wheelchair that, with several straps, kept him on his feet at the counter. He called himself the "Robo-Chef."
In recent years, business began to fall off as chain restaurants moved into the area. Mr. Nucci also began to suffer from infections and various other ailments.
He closed Willows several years ago but recently leased it to a couple who reopened the restaurant under the same name.
John Attilio Nucci was born June 16, 1961, in Silver Spring. His father, an engineer, and his mother, a trained bacteriologist, were the children of Italian immigrants. As a teenager, he worked as a dishwasher and line chef at local restaurants. A graduate of Montgomery Blair High School in Silver Spring, he received a certificate from a culinary institute in Baltimore in 1983.
Survivors include his three older sisters, Elise Nucci Thompson of Lusby, Stefanie Nucci Vogel of Columbia and Anne T. Nucci-Sack of the Bronx.
In August 1989, Kelvin M. Smith, then 21, pleaded guilty in D.C. Superior Court to counts of armed kidnapping, armed robbery and armed burglary in several crimes, including the attack on Mr. Nucci. He was sentenced to 85 years to life in prison.
Mr. Nucci sometimes visited schools to talk about the effects of gun violence. "I'm not bitter at the guys who shot me," he said in 1990. "These guys had no conscience, no soul. I just hope they do now."

Friday incidents include shooting
An 18-year-old woman was slightly wounded by gunfire Friday night, capping an evening of mayhem after a basketball game at Gar-Field Senior High School in Woodbridge, police said. 
Authorities said a large fight broke out at the school after the game, and officers dispersed several unruly crowds of young people, with no injuries reported. Police, however, were summoned to Potomac Mills mall and then, near 10:30 p.m., to the area of Old Triangle Road and Heth Court in Dumfries. 
Police said several shots were fired at the second location, but nobody was hurt. A short while later, at Old Triangle Road and Sigel Court, more shots were fired.
Police said the 18-year-old victim was a pedestrian who had not been involved in the earlier disturbances.
Authorities said Saturday night that they arrested Johnnie P. Kamara, 19, of no fixed address, in connection with the shooting.

Man gets 30 years for taxi robberies
A D.C. man was sentenced Friday to 30 years in prison for a string of armed robberies of city taxi drivers in 2009.
In May and early June of that year, Kevin Stoddard, 45, robbed four taxi drivers at gunpoint and attempted to rob another, said the U.S. attorney's office in the District.
In four of the cases, authorities said, Stoddard got into cabs near Seventh and H streets NW, in the Chinatown area, and asked to be taken to what turned out to be secluded areas of Northwest or Northeast Washington. Then he would display a gun and rob them.
In a November trial in D.C. Superior Court, Stoddard was convicted of four counts of armed robbery, one count of attempted armed robbery and several weapons-related charges.

what makes spies tick

On a rainy day in the spring of 1967, I shuffled into a classroom at the U.S. Army Intelligence Schoolג[#x2c6][#x161] at Fort Holabird, Md.,ג[#x2c6][#x161] in a grimy industrial area just northcq this? doesn't seem to be around anymore; say that?/fx  of East Baltimore. There were about 30 of us, mostly college graduates, including from newly minted lawyers and to a few erstwhile hippies who had received draft notices. It was the first day of a seven-month course blandly entitled "Area Studies."
In fact, we were going to learn to be spies.
Truth be told, few of us expected to be turned into James Bonds. Most of us had volunteered for an extra year's enlistment in intelligence to avoid being shipped off to South Vietnam with a rifle.  
Of course, intelligence did sound exciting, and only vaguely dangerous. I doubt that any of us knew exactly what to expect. A cross between "Mission: Impossible" and "The Spy Who Came in From the Cold,"ג[#x2c6][#x161] maybe.
The shades were drawn. A rectangular red sign, "SECRET," was slid into a bracket on the front wall. An instructor stepped to the podium.
I remember him saying something like: "This is the only thing in the Army that you can volunteer for and then get out of if you change your mind." That's because we had signed up for something illegal, even immoral, according to some people, he said.
It was called espionage. We were not going to be turned into spies, he explained, but "case officers" - the people who recruit foreigners to be spies. Put another way, he went on, we were going to persuade foreigners to be traitors, to steal their  countries' secrets. We were going to learn how to lie, steal, cheat to accomplish our mission, he said - and betray people who trusted us, if need be. Anyone who objected, he concluded, could walk out right now.
He looked around. One man got up and left. The rest of us, a little anxious, stayed put.
And then we were off. Espionage training, it turned out, was a gas - a boy's life, really, what with running around Baltimore planting "dead drops" under park benches, eluding spy catchers, practicing "brush passes" on city streets, writing messages in "invisible ink." We learned how to send an agent behind the Iron Curtain and get him back out. On my final training exercise, I slipped into Connecticut via submarine, en route to my target in a Midwestern city.
Alas, with the Vietnam War raging, Berlin (where "The Spy Who Came in From the Cold" was set)  wasn't in the cards. After a year in language school, I would ship out to Da Nang. I spent a year living undercover and running a spy net. But other than connecting briefly with a secret courier on a deserted beach every few days and slipping into decrepit hotels for meetings with my top spy, it wasn't anything like the scenario we had been trained for, to dispatch agents into Soviet-occupied Eastern Europe from West Berlin.
But in the end, it was the most interesting, and perhaps meaningful, thing I've ever done. The mission, to prevent or disrupt rocket attacks on the city or U.S. troops, was important. The war stunk,   but I wasn't shooting at anybody, and I was good at being a spy.  I won a medal and came home relatively unscarred.
If the war hadn't been so wrong, I might have stayed in, or moved to the CIA. But even after I hung up my badge, the intense indoctrination in the clandestine life - the habit of eliciting scraps of information from unwitting people, the quick instinct to deflect personal questions and even check to see if I was being followed - stayed with me for years. I lived in an alternate universe, seeing spies at work, real or imagined, everywhere in Washington.
I often wondered why I had been such a natural spy, though. Had my recruiters, who put me through reams of tests, somehow known that? It would be 25 years before I had a clue. 
After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in late 1941, the Roosevelt administration slapped together a wartime spying and sabotage service virtually overnight. The Office of Strategic Services, as it was called, quickly discovered that many of the Ivy-educated men (and a few women) it dispatched to Nazi-occupied Europe were unsuited for the job.
"That many of the early officers came from the Ivy League was a natural progression of events," Joseph C. Goulden, author of "The Dictionary of Espionage," recently wrote. They "had traveled (or lived) in Europe, and knew the languages and the cultures." Nevertheless, the prominence of the well-bred in the OSS prompted sophisticates to snicker that its initials stood for "Oh so social." 
Knowing how to speak French in a tux didn't necessarily prepare recruits for parachuting into enemy territory or blowing up bridges. There were "dramatic mental crackups" from the stress, according to Louie M. Banks III, an Army major who studied OSSrecruitment. One OSS captain who chafed at fighting the Nazis from undercover in Yugoslavia slipped into Germany to personally mail an expletive-laden postcard to Adolf Hitler, according to reports.
There were also Mafia psychopaths recruited in New York, Philadelphia and Detroit to wage mayhem in Italy. And the hilariously incompetent, such as the OSS operative whose cover was so far blown that when he dropped into his favorite restaurant, the band played "Boo! Boo! I'm a Spy."
In 1943, the OSS went back to the drawing board. It hired a squad of psychologists and plunked them down at a secret training installation in Fairfax, code-named Station S, where it began putting recruits through a barrage of tests to determine who was suited for its missions.
A major problem was that the psychologists didn't really know much about the skills required for spying and sabotage. So, they started with a grab bag of untested assumptions. 
The "generally more athletic" types were considered "potential saboteurs," according to a 2003 study by Sally Kuhlenschmidt, a Western Kentucky University psychology professor. Those "generally more educated, less athletic" were grouped as "potential spies." The "potential propagandists" tended to be "emigres" and "more artistic."
In the end, the OSS adopted a system that focused less on specific job skills and more on the "man as a whole." The new focus would be on the recruits' motivation, energy and initiative, intelligence and problem-solving skills, emotional stability, physical condition, and, not least, a demonstrated ability to keep their  mouths shut.
According to its official postwar history, the OSS program "certainly succeeded in screening out the 15 percent to 20 percent who were obviously unfit." But 30 years later, one of its own designers, Donald MacKinnon, conceded in a study that it was "not very successful in predicting performance overseas."
I was sitting on a park bench in Da Nang, worrying, trying to calmly eat a roll with my chicory coffee. 
That man sitting nearby, ostensibly reading a newspaper. Had he followed me? He looked familiar. Alas, Vietnamese faces were still a blur. 
I finished my baguette and moved along, looking as casual as possible. I ambled through the open-air market, stopping to finger vegetables, using the stalls to look around. I saw only a river of conical-hatted peasants. How could I be sure I wasn't being tailed?
There were other worries: Had my assistant thoroughly cased the street in front of the hotel where I would soon be meeting my main spy? Would my Joe be on time? How long should I wait? 
Suddenly, I realized I had left my valise under the bench. It was packed with a .45-caliber pistol and hundreds of dollars' worth of Vietnamese piastres.   Trying to hide the blood draining from my face, I went back. Miraculously, it was still there.
I wasn't cut out for this part of the business, I eventually decided (even though I would hear later of far, far greater sums "misplaced" on operations). Recruiting and managing agents, yes. Spotting trouble with an operation, yes. Writing novella-like analyses, yes.
But the field work - the careful movements, countersurveillance, unexpected glitches and possible gunplay - no. That called for people with the nerves of a cat burglar; I probably belonged behind a desk.
Intelligence analysis is a huge part of the CIA's business. But it's the operations wing (born in 1952 as the Directorate of Plans,   now called the National Clandestine Service) that remains the CIA's cutting edge and defines its character. And it's the CIA's medical office that largely decides what that character is.
"A basic strength - or weakness, for those who [have] wanted to change the culture of the operations-officer population - was that the psychometrics have remained constant," Frank Anderson, a former head of the Near East operations division, says by e-mail. "By that, I mean that the psychological/personality testing, administered by the office of medical services, tested for and selected the same personality traits. So you consistently end up with the same personality types."
They are the people who like to break china. Operations people don't just collect intelligence; they blackmail foreign officials, scientists and business people; bribe union leaders; break into embassies; assassinate people; overthrow governments; and sometimes, far worse (or better, depending on your perspective).
All for a good cause, of course.
"The reason people joined up during the Cold War and today in the fight against terrorism is the patriotic sense of mission," says Jack Devine, a retired top CIA operations official. "It may sound hokey, but at the end of the day, this remains the incentive. The mystique and adventure help, but the bottom line is public service in defense of our country and its values." 
Some CIA veterans put their motivation more baldly.
George White was a CIA operative through the darkest days of the Cold War, including when the agency was testing hallucinogenic drugs on unwitting targets. One of his assignments was to slip LSD into the drinks of unwitting people in a San Francisco bar and see how they reacted.
"I toiled wholeheartedly in the vineyards because it was fun, fun, fun," he wrote in a letter to his boss made public after his death. "Where else could a red-blooded American boy lie, kill, cheat, steal, rape and pillage with the sanction and blessing of the All-Highest?"
A more typical answer comes from Robert Baer, the former CIA operative whose Beirut exploits inspired the 2005 George Clooney thriller "Syriana." Baer signed up in the middle of mass disenchantment over Vietnam, Watergate and CIA assassination plots.
 "The CIA held out the promise that I didn't have to sell shoes," he says.
In the early 1980s, Charles "Sam" Faddis left a promising career as a prosecutor in the Washington state attorney general's office. "Part of it was wanderlust," he says. "I couldn't see sitting in a car and commuting 12 miles to work every day. There was also a lot of stuff happening in the world that I wanted to be part of, not just read about."
He saw a job description of a CIA ops officer in a magazine: foreign travel, languages, danger, be smart, serve your country. "I thought, that's what I want to do," he says. "Of course, then I had to explain it to my wife." (She eventually signed up, too.)
Likewise, Gene Smith was working as a deputy prosecutor in Indiana in 1981 when she "jumped at" a CIA employment ad. "It was too small a world," she says of her previous job. "You do a tangible good, you remove bad guys from the street, and you assist crime victims. But I felt like I was saving the world one by one. ג[#x20ac]¦ I wanted a bigger world." 
After the quick, and mostly unexpected, collapse of the Soviet Union about 20 years ago, the agency languished. There were big cutbacks. The agency lacked a big mission.
On Sept. 11, 2001, it got one. 
In many ways, the CIA's new generation mirrored its   grandfathers'. They were smart, imaginative, patriotic risk-takers, eager to deal death and dirty tricks against the new enemy.
But that's where the similarities ended. The upper classes were gone, people such as CIA Director George Tenet, a son of Greek and Albanian immigrants, now ran the agency, and women and minorities were a common sight at headquarters. 
"Nine-eleven really pissed me off,"  says one woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity in exchange for speaking freely about her experiences. She was working as a flight attendant when hijacked airlinersflew into the World Trade Center and Pentagon. "I wanted to serve my country, to be part of the solution." She ended up in Iraq in 2005, running spies against the insurgency.
And there was another change in the workforce, which CIA veterans say they began to notice in the 1990s. A conspicuous number of the newer hires weren't in it for the long haul. They seemed bored with the routine slogging of spy work, often in the world's backwaters, whether it was courting a junior Chinese engineer in Mozambique or following an Iranian trade official around Karachi.
The new generation wanted action. They wanted the movie. Being cooped up in the Baghdad Green Zone with 400 other case officers, moving around in armored trucks with escorts didn't cut it.
"When I first came in, you had a lot of people who were there in response to what I would call a calling," says Faddis, who retired in 2008 as chief of a unit tracking nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. "They had really been drawn to this place that they thought was very special, a special thing that meant a lifetime commitment.
"Increasingly, as years go by, we've seen people come in who just see it as another career, and for whatever reason chose this one. They're more impatient for rewards."
"I would be hesitant to call it [a sense of] entitlement, as I think that is too damning, " says Jack Platt, who spent a quarter-century matching wits with   the Soviet KGB. "But it comes close, though."
A crusty, lanky man in his late 70s, Platt still teaches courses on dodging tails and terrorists "to several U.S. government organizations," as he puts it. 
"They are faster gamers, faster readers [and] see far more of the world at a young age than I did, even as an Army brat," he says of the latest CIA generation. "And technically very smart." But something's lacking.
The World War II generation and the first wave of baby boomers "learned early on that struggle is our brother. ג[#x20ac]¦ We learned endurance and roughing it from sandlot baseball, a fistfight, pumping gas or mowing lawns," Platt says. Even more important, the military draft forced millions of young men into close quarters with men they might never have otherwise met. It leveled American society, and the CIA benefited greatly from that.
"Some of these younger men and women are exceptional," he quickly adds, "and ג[#x20ac]¦ tough enough. I would work for and follow them in a heartbeat. But too many men and women from this generation simply give up early, seemingly exhausted by an assignment that lasts longer than 42 minutes."
Alexandria psychiatrist David L. Charney, 68,       has spent decades treating the emotional problems of CIA personnel. The operations people are "excitement junkies," he says. They quickly tire of one task and take on another, like plate-spinners who keep adding items until the whole enterprise crashes.
"They seem to be highly functional ADDs," people with attention deficit disorder, he says. "You might think a person with ADD can't tie their shoelaces, but quite the opposite is true. They're energetic, restless, people who have to physically keep moving. Lock them to a desk, and they can't deal with it. They can't stand to be bored."
But all these things - ADD, a thirst for adventure, bravery, curiosity, patriotism, whatever - were shiny surfaces, it seemed to me. Superficial, even obvious, reasons some people are drawn to the spy game. 
I wanted to know what really made spies tick, what made me tick.
DAVID CORNWELL WORKED in British intelligence in the 1950s and 1960s, when some of its most trusted personnel were exposed as Soviet moles.
Taking up the pen name John le Carrֳ©, he began writing psychological espionage thrillers that explored the dual, even triple, lives of spies. 
As it turned out, le Carrֳ©'s father was a pathological liar, whom the author limned in his semi-autobiographical thriller "A Perfect Spy." Its central character is Magnus Pym, a British intelligence agent whose father, like le Carrֳ©'s, was a colossal con man. Pym had spent his youth spying on his father, peeling away the lies one by one, like old wallpaper. 
In le Carrֳ©'s book, a Czech man named Axel, who had been close to Pym when they were students years earlier in Switzerland, makes contact out of the blue. Now a communist agent, he plays on Pym's neuroses, inveigling him into betraying his country. Pym balks, but Axel knows his mark well. 
"For once," he beseeches Pym, "nature has produced a perfect match. You are a perfect spy. All you need is a cause. I have it."
I had  watched the TV adaptation shortly before I visited  Charney. I asked him if he had seen it. 
He nodded. I decided to share a personal story. 
For most of my life, I told him, I'd had a puzzling dream: I'd be sitting in a church with my father, an ardent Episcopalian. He'd be counting out cash to me, bill by bill. Behind him, the cross glittered. But the bills, I'd discover, were all counterfeit, like Monopoly money. 
That was it. I'd wake up, I told Charney. The dream followed me through intelligence school, through Vietnam and back again, I said. I had turned against the war and resigned, but I never regretted my time as a spy. Indeed, I said, I was glad to have been on the inside, if only for a short time, learning how people in that business thought. For the past 30 or so years, I'd put to use some of those tools as an investigative reporter.http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/spy-talk
Charney was listening closely, quietly.
The dream continued, year after year, I went on. My father and I had never been close, so I never discussed it with him. Then, one day in 1992, I learned that he wasn't my birth father after all: I had been born of an affair between my mother and another man while he was away during the war. The family secret had been kept from me all those years.
I was shocked, of course, I told Charney. But suddenly the fake money in the dream I'd had all those years made sense: My father's love for me, however heroic, had been fundamentally manufactured. 
The dream had immediately evaporated, never to return. 
That was my story. Charney had listened intently. He nodded.
"A lot of people who go into law enforcement, or intelligence, grow up with a need to protect, to get at the truth, to set things straight, based on their childhood," he said slowly.
"They're seeking the real truth. They know things aren't right, based on their childhood, and vow to never let that happen again." 
And that was me, I guessed. I, too, had been a perfect spy. All I'd needed was a cause.

North Dakota school allegedly was diploma mill

DATELINE: BISMARCK, N.D.

BISMARCK, N.D. - No immediate discipline is planned for any Dickinson State University employees in the wake of an audit that determined the school awarded hundreds of degrees to foreign students who didn't earn them, the chancellor of North Dakota's university system said Saturday. 
However, Jon Brudvig, the university vice president in charge of overseeing the program in which the students studied resigned Friday after the audit was released. Jon Brudvig, Dickinson State's vice president for academic affairs, will continue to work at the university in a to-be determined role while he looks for another job, Chancellor William Goetz told the Associated Press.
The audit did not mention Brudvig by name, and Goetz said his resignation wasn't requested.
"It was a decision [Brudvig] made not to continue with those responsibilities," he said. "It was his decision."
Chancellor William Goetz wouldn't discuss whether the apparent suicide of university administrator Doug LaPlante was connected to the audit's release. The audit did not mention LaPlante, but he led the business program in which many affected students studied. LaPlante, 59, the dean of the school's college of education, business and applied sciences, was found dead of an apparently  self-inflicted gunshot wound Friday afternoon near an intersection. "I cannot say whether his unfortunate death may have had anything to do with the audit," Goetz said.
LaPlante and many other university officials were told about the audit before it was released Friday morning, but no one faced immediate sanctions as a result of its findings, he said.
"I won't draw any conclusions at this time," Goetz said. "We certainly want to make certain issues are handled appropriately."
The audit determined that 10 of the 410 foreign students who earned joint degrees from Dickinson and their home universities since 2003 had completed all their requirements. Most were Chinese, it said. The rest were Russian. Goetz said hundreds of students may have their degrees revoked, but they will have an opportunity to legitimately earn them.
"Certainly they did not meet the requirements of the degree that was granted them," Goetz said. "We will grant them the opportunity to fulfill those requirements."
The report also recommended Dickinson State cancel the 127 agreements it has with international schools pending a fresh evaluation of each. It found many of the agreements weren't properly registered with the appropriate university office and didn't contain detailed implementation plans.
Goetz is retiring in August, when he finishes his fifth year as the North Dakota university system's top administrator. The system includes six four-year universities and five two-year colleges, an enrollment of almost 49,000 students.
Goetz is a former state lawmaker and administrator at Dickinson State.

Pakistani premier risks jail for loyalty

BYLINE: Richard Leiby

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A15

LENGTH: 927 words

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, PAKISTAN

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan - They now inhabit regal mansions in this capital, but the prime minister and the president of Pakistan have known their share of more lowbrow addresses - namely, jail cells.
For Pakistani politicians, getting tossed into prison - whether for shameless plunder and graft or trumped-up charges brought by vindictive foes - is an occupational hazard.
Now, some observers are predicting that Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani is headed back behind bars. The Supreme Court on Friday denied his attempt to block his prosecution and ordered him to appear in court Monday to be indicted for contempt. 
The charge, which carries penalties of six months in jail and possible removal from office, stems from Gilani's adamant refusal to pursue an old money-laundering case brought by Swiss authorities against President Asif Ali Zardari. Gilani has asserted that the constitution grants Zardari immunity, but the court insists that rule of law would be subverted if the prime minister were allowed to flout its orders.
Gilani, who has held his job since 2008 and is the longest-serving prime minister in Pakistan's history, has said he will go to jail if the court orders him to. That prospect has raised fears that Pakistan's fragile democracy could well collapse at a time when the nuclear-armed, strategically vital country is racked by an Islamist insurgency, severe energy shortages and an economic crisis.
"Frankly, we are going toward anarchy very, very soon," warned Sen. Safdar Abbasi, a member of the ruling Pakistan People's Party who has long called for Gilani to cooperate with the courts. The contempt battle has dominated political discourse for too long, he added, while leaders ignore the pressing problems of their constituents.
"The government should end this crisis," Abbasi said. "It's like playing with a loaded gun."
Because Gilani and Zardari were never particularly close, pundits are still puzzling out the prime minister's motivations for risking his job for Zardari, who has dismal popularity ratings and a long history of corruption allegations, including accusations of kickbacks and shakedowns.
Some see the 59-year-old prime minister finally shedding his unassuming personality and coming into his own. "He has shown backbone, he has shown grit," said Ayaz Amir, an opposition member of Parliament and a columnist.
The contempt charge stems from a 2009 Supreme Court ruling that declared unconstitutional a national amnesty enacted two years earlier. That amnesty cleared Zardari and thousands of others of past alleged crimes. The court ordered the government to write a letter to Swiss authorities requesting that they reopen the corruption cases against Zardari, who was investigated along with Benazir Bhutto, his late wife and a former prime minister, for their financial dealings there in the 1990s.
Besides staring down the court, Gilani recently lashed out at the country's powerful military and intelligence establishment. During an episode known here as Memogate, he bristled at the military's efforts to control the investigation of a mysterious missive that sought U.S. help in averting a possible coup after the killing of Osama bin Laden in Pakistan.
Gilani asserted in a December speech that there was no place for a "state within a state" that claimed national security and foreign policy authority that should belong to the civilian leadership. Although he would later temper his criticism, the prime minister said then that control of the military resides in the executive branch.
The speech struck many as remarkable in its defiance, given the military's penchant for dethroning elected governments. "Very few civilians have stood up to the army and lived to tell the tale, so to speak," Amir noted.
Gilani hails from an influential family in Multan, a southern city in Punjab province, and entered politics when he was 26. Bhutto picked Gilani to be speaker of the National Assembly during her first term in office in the early 1990s. That stint led later to accusations of patronage and abuses of power, and Gilani was arrested in 2001 by the government of Gen. Pervez Musharraf.
A court freed Gilani in 2006, after he served more than five years. Nusrat Javeed, a columnist and TV anchor, said that at one point, both the future prime minister and the future president were incarcerated at the same facility, in Rawalpindi. All told, Zardari spent 11 years in prison in Pakistan but was never convicted.
Gilani came to power in 2008 as the consensus candidate after the PPP won elections held in the aftermath of Bhutto's assassination. Having survived this far into his five-year term in coup-prone Pakistan, Gilani may not care if he has to leave office: "He might be thinking, 'I have already made history - the Supreme Court can do what it wants,'ג[#x20ac][#x160]" Javeed said.
Another theory holds that Gilani wants to go out as a selfless political martyr who showed his unflagging party fealty to the very end. Such sacrifice would leave a dynastic legacy for his children, who also are involved in politics. Some PPP officials insist that there is no replacement for Gilani in the wings, but that the party will stand by his decision if he continues to defy the court and is forced to resign.
Then there's another option, according to party insiders: Zardari could pardon Gilani immediately after he's convicted.

To care for others

BYLINE: Amanda Long

SECTION: MAGAZINE; Pg. A03

LENGTH: 370 words

I was with one lady for 10 years. You see a lot happen to someone in 10 years, big changes and small things that only you notice at first, until that person doesn't look like herself anymore. She had been a lieutenant colonel, very high up, very respected, and when I started she was still in charge. She still was running her life. But the longer I was with her, the more I did. She had all these people around her - not family - but someone to take care of her yard, the man to fix her house. It was not easy to watch. I know it wasn't easy for her. She liked control. But she didn't complain. She wasn't like that. Her thinking was strong; her body wasn't. 
I cried and cried at her funeral. It was at Arlington Cemetery, and you should have seen it. All the soldiers and the guns, it was very powerful and beautiful. After she died, I said, "No more." This is just too hard. It hurt too much. You get so close. You see the person every day, and you see them like nobody else does. After 10 years, she was a part of my life, and then she wasn't. That was very, very hard. So I quit.
I got another job, but it wasn't enough to pay the mortgage. See, that lady, my client, had told me that as a woman, I have to have something of my own. She said to me - all the time - "You have to take care of yourself. No one else will." See, she had been in the military all her life. Always moving around. But she made sure to have a beautiful, big, nice house. "Stop renting, stop giving your money away to someone else," she said. "Own a home." So I did. I bought a house. I love it; it's all mine. When I go home at night, it's just me. My kids are grown. It's sometimes too quiet. But I have good neighbors, people like me, who like to take care of one another. 
So, I had to start doing home health care again; it's what I know best. It's where my heart is. I work with one man now. He is paralyzed from the neck down. I do everything for him, everything. Breakfast, bath, shampoo his hair, put on his diaper, clothes. It is a private job; you know so much about a person. I sometimes dream that he gets up and walks. I am trying not to get too close. I do my job, but it is not easy to not care too much, you know? My job is to care.

Taking struggles on road

Less than 24 hours after losing for the sixth time in seven gamesand for the sixth time in a row against Miami, the Washington Wizards boarded a plane for Detroit to embark on their first extended road trip of the season. 
The five-game swing over 10 days comes on the heels of a 106-89 defeat on Friday night in which the Wizards pushed the Eastern Conference champions throughout the first 36 minutes but failed to pull ahead despite twice trimming the margin to one late in the third quarter. 
So players and Coach Randy Wittman reinforced, as they have all season, a commitment to concentration and resolve from tip-off to final whistle. To this point in the season, the Wizards have assembled mostly incomplete performances, and those lapses have yielded five wins in 27 games, including a 3-7 recordsince Wittman took over for fired Flip Saunders on Jan. 24.
"That's the tale of our season thus far," reserve swingman Maurice Evanssaid in the locker room after playing 13 minutes 42 seconds with five points against the Heat. "We're in games. We're out of games. But as long as we compete, we're playing for the big picture."
Washington's effort on Friday underscored both the promise and pitfalls for a team whose roster is filled with youth and inexperience. JaVale McGee, for instance, scored a season-high 24 points and had 13 rebounds, but the starting center missed a dunk at the end of the third quarter and later lost the ball out of bounds when the Wizards were making a push to get back in it.
Starting point guard John Wallcontributed 15 points and a game-high 10 assists, but his game-high seven turnovers played a role in the outcome despite long stretches where marquee players such as LeBron James appeared disengaged.Nick Young had 22 points for the Wizards, but his other contributions included just two rebounds and one assist in nearly 39 minutes.
"We've just got to keep building," Wittman said when asked what he wanted to accomplish during this road trip. "We'll see where we are mentally because we had grueling stretch at home with some good teams."
The Wizards won't have the services of injured forward Andray Blatche (strained left calf) for the duration of the trip, but they may get back Rashard Lewis. The veteran forward has missed the past three games with a sore left knee that flared up earlier this week.
Wittman said during before Friday's game that Lewis was "close to being able to play again." After joining the Wizards from Orlando last season, Lewis averaged 11.4 points and 5.8 rebounds in nearly 32 minutes during 32 games, 27 of which he started. His production has dipped to 8.5 points and four rebounds in 22 injury-plagued games this year.
Lewis has been in and out of the starting lineup this season, with rookie small forward Chris Singletongetting 11 starts. In the last three games with Lewis out, Singleton has combined for 10 points, including none on Friday. The ACC defensive player of the year last season, though, did help limit James to 18 points on 6-for-14 shooting.
Washington, meantime, had its own shooting woes to address after the game. The Wizards shot 38 percent, missed 17 of 21 three-pointers and went 17 for 28 from the free throw line. Washington missed 18 of 27 shots in the third quarter when Miami built a double-figure lead.
"We have to make shots as a team when we're getting open shots," said Wall, who shot 52.4 percent (32 for 61) during the Wizards' four-game homestand.
The Wizards are ranked third to last in the NBA in field goal percentage (.420), 27th in three-point shooting (.295) and 25th in points per game (90).
Among the nine Wizards players who have started this season, only two, Trevor Booker and McGee, are making more than half their field goal attempts, and five are shooting less than 41 percent.
"We've got to try to take care of the road," said Young, who missed 12 of 19 shots against the Heat. "We're going back on the West Coast trip. There's going to be some tough games and some games we should be able to pull out."

Don't blame the U.S. for Mexico's gun supply

SECTION: EDITORIAL COPY; Pg. A20

LENGTH: 230 words

Regarding the Feb. 5 editorial "The gun flow to Mexico":
The Post's assertion that 70 to 80 percent of traceable guns can be traced to the United States has long been discredited. Mexican police trace only a fraction of the guns they seize, and they are specifically trained not to request U.S. traces on guns without U.S. markings, according to Sen. Charles E. Grassley (Iowa), the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee. Furthermore, according to federal data released in June, 78 percent of firearms submitted for tracing in 2009 and 66 percent of firearms submitted in 2010 were not traced back to final sales by U.S. licensed dealers. 
The Calderon and Obama administrations need every possible diversion from the real problems that cause and exacerbate this drug war. 
The Mexicans need to take the spotlight away from the rampant corruption that plagues their  government, judiciary, law enforcement agencies and military.
President Obama desperately needs distractions from the criminal culpability and gross incompetence of his Justice Department and his attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr., with regard to the deadly Fast and Furious tragedy. 
Regrettably, it appears that both administrations have found a willing collaborator in The Post.

U.N. consultantkilled in Cairo
An Egyptian woman who worked for the United Nations as a consultant was fatally shot in the head Sunday while driving through a Cairo neighborhood, security officials said.
It was not immediately clear whether the woman, identified as Nermeen Gomaa Khalil, 41, was targeted or killed in a random crime. Police said she was shot by unidentified gunmen passing in another car.
Khalil was shot while driving in Mohandiseen, according to a security official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to reporters. Khawla Mattar, director of the U.N. Information Center in Egypt, said Khalil was a consultant with a women's fund at the United Nations in Cairo.

Fuel removal underway on ship
Underwater pumping operations began Sunday to remove some of the 500,000 gallons of fuel aboard the Costa Concordia, officials said, nearly a month after the cruise ship ran aground off Tuscany.
After nearly two weeks of delays because of rough seas and bad weather, the pumping got underway on the first of 15 tanks that are thought to hold about 84 percent of the fuel on board, Italy's civil protection department said.
Officials say it will take 28 consecutive days of pumping to empty the tanks.

Provincial judgeis assassinated
A provincial judge from a restive eastern province was assassinated Sunday, Afghan officials said. The judge's 8-year-old daughter was killed with him, they said.
For the past several years, the Taliban and affiliated insurgent groups have carried out a concerted campaign of assassinations, taking aim at influential local figures - tribal elders, community leaders, municipal and provincial officials - because of perceived loyalty to the central Afghan government.
Such targeted killings account for a growing proportion of overall civilian deaths in the war in Afghanistan, the United Nations said in a recent report.
The victim of the latest shooting was Mohammad Nasir, who led the appeals court in Konar province, which lies near Pakistan's tribal areas and has been the scene of heavy fighting over the past year. The killing occurred as the judge was visiting relatives in neighboring Nangahar province.

Airstrike targets suspected rebels
Turkish warplanes have bombed suspected Kurdish rebel targets in northern Iraq, the military said Sunday - its second cross-border airstrike in just over a week.
The jets hit caves and other rebel shelters in Iraq's Zap and Hakurk regions, near the border with Turkey, in an operation that began late Saturday, a military statement said.
All planes returned to base safely after the "effective" operation, the military said, but it did not provide any details about casualties or damage caused to the rebels of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, which is fighting for autonomy in Turkey's largely Kurdish southeast.
PKK spokesman Bahtiyar Dogan said areas targeted were "farms, villages and old bases, which are not used by the PKK anymore," adding that there were no casualties among PKK fighters or the villagers.
Dogan said the airstrikes were in response to a recent PKK attack that allegedly resulted in dozens of Turkish military casualties.

No talks without settlement freeze, Abbas says:Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has told the Arab League he will not resume peace talks without an Israeli settlement freeze. His comments Sunday seemed to close the door to further negotiations because Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly rejected a settlement freeze.as well as a demand to accept Israel's pre-1967 war frontier as the basis for a border with a future Palestine.

Primary schools suspend thousands

BYLINE: Donna St. George

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A08

LENGTH: 1985 words

Thousands of elementary students were suspended from public schools last year in Washington and its suburbs, some of them so young that they were learning about out-of-school discipline before they could spell or multiply.
Those sent home for their behavior included kindergartners in nearly every area school system - 94 in Prince George's County, 74 in Fairfax County, 61 in Anne Arundel County, 50 in the D.C. school system, 38 in Prince William County and 22 in Montgomery County. 
They included children who idled at home for a day or two and some who accompanied their parents to work.
They included the pre-kindergarten son of Rajuawn Thompkins, who said the boy was removed from his D.C. charter school for kicking off his shoes and crying in frustration. Thompkins had thought the boy was too young to be suspended.  
He was 4. 
"I would explain it to him, and he still didn't understand," she said. "He'd ask me, 'Mommy, why can't I go to school?' " 
His pointed question underlies a debate about the merits of out-of-school suspension. 
Some researchers and critics question whether children in the early grades should ever be suspended. The goal should be teaching appropriate behavior, they say,  not sending students home.  
Still, many educators see suspension as necessary - a strong message about conduct that crosses the line. Many parents, too, suggest that students who cause a disruption in class, no matter what age, need to be removed. Especially when a child or teacher has been physically hurt, many principals view suspension as an important tool. 
A Washington Post analysis of data for 13 of the region's school systems found that last school year more than 6,112 elementary students, from pre-kindergarten through grade 5, were suspended or expelled for hitting, disrupting, disrespecting, fighting and other offenses.
The total includes 433 kindergartners, 677 first-graders, 813 second-graders and 1,086 third-graders. More than 50 pre-kindergartners were suspended. 
In all, those cases represent a small segment of suspensions in the region, and affect from 1 percent  to 3 percent of elementary children in most school systems. But some experts say that age sets them apart.
For children younger than 7 or 8, "all they understand a couple of days into this is they are having snow days - and nobody else is," said Walter S. Gilliam, author of a national study on pre-kindergarten expulsions and director of the Edward Zigler Center in Child Development and Social Policy at the Yale Child Study Center.
Gilliam said suspension is at odds with teaching the social and behavioral skills many young students lack. "We would never send a child home because that child was struggling at reading," he said. "We would never send a child home if that child was struggling with math. Why would we send a child home for struggling with social-emotional skills?"
On those removed from school, the effect is complex. They lose instruction time and slip behind in classes. But there may be other fallout, too: lower regard from peers or teachers, a shift in identity, an alienation from school. "I would be worried it would set in motion a negative trajectory that would gather momentum across the next years of schooling," said Anne Gregory, a Rutgers University assistant professor and education researcher.
School officials said they try to avoid suspensions of the very young and use positive-behavior initiatives to prevent discipline problems. They said that relatively few students are suspended and that those cases often involve safety issues or repeated misbehavior. 
"To me a suspension is for something so unprovoked, or something so out of the norm, that I, as the adult, had no other option," said Judy Brubaker, principal at Spark M. Matsunaga Elementary School in Germantown. 
Brubaker and other principals said they carefully consider each case and often look to other options - involving parents and counselors, creating behavior plans - before suspension.
 It is "absolutely not our default," said Kimberly Willison, principal of Clearview Elementary School in Herndon, who recalled several cases, each with escalated circumstances. "It's not something we ever do lightly," she said.
In Alexandria, Lawrence Jointer, director of hearings, investigations and student alternative services, said discipline problems appear to have intensified during his career of four decades. "We see aggressive behavior from kindergarten on up," he said, and it is tough to affect that behavior when parents are disengaged.
"I understand it gets to a point where principals and teachers feel they've tried everything they can," he said. Sometimes, suspension is a way to "drive the point home: 'This is serious behavior we're dealing with at school, and we need your support.' " 
Nationally, suspension practices are being debated and rethought. The Maryland State Board of Educationis consideringproposals to end suspensions for nonviolent offenses. Last summer, federal officials launched a broader discipline reformeffort as new research highlighted harmful effects. 
Many experts say no research indicates that suspensions improve a child's behavior or make schools safer. But studies have shown that suspended students are more prone to low achievement, dropping out of school and landing in the juvenile justicesystem.
In elementary school, behavior problems can be rooted in academic gaps - being unable to read, for example, when classmates are poring over books, said Sara Rimm-Kaufman, associate professor of education at University of Virginia. "It's an emotional response to not knowing what everyone else knows," she said.
Suspensions have markedly increased nationwide since the 1970s, and some experts suggest that suspensions of younger children reflect, in part, a zero-tolerancehttp://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/fairfax-schools-discipline-under-scrutiny-after-teens-suspension-for-medication/2011/03/08/ABZBiZQ_story.html culture that hastaken holdin schools during the past 20 years. 
Among cases that attracted national attention was the 2010 suspension of a Michigan 6-year-old who formed his hand into the shape of a gun. A year earlier, a Delaware 6-year-old was ousted for having a Cub Scout camping tool that included a knife.
Last spring, an 8-year-old boy in Fairfax pocketed a pill for his attention deficit disorder as he rushed to leave for school. After he went to take the medication during a restroom break, he was suspended for possession of a controlled substance, his mother said.
Fairfax, which was under fire at the time for its discipline policies, has since eased its approachto prescription medication, allowing principals more discretion in punishment. The 8-year-old was out of class for 10 school days, his mother said. "It was extreme," she said.
Fairfax School Board member Elizabeth Schultz (Springfield) said the key to suspension is "proportionality." Some families have complained about elementary-age students suspended for disrupting class and going to the bathroom repeatedly, she said. "To me, it has to be really significant," she said, such as imminent danger.
Psychologists and researchers say suspensions can send the wrong message. 
"At that age, most of them go home, and if they are allowed to watch TV or play video games, it can be more fun than school and reinforce the behavior that is negative," said school psychologist Melissa Reeves, who teaches at Winthrop University in South Carolina. 
Some schools, Reeves said, rely on suspension because they lack funding for other options. "The challenge," she said, "is having the resources for alternatives," programs  that teach anger management, social skills, problem-solving and conflict resolution. 
 In Prince George's, A. Duane Arbogast, chief academic officer for county schools, said suspension is one of many tools to improve student conduct. Sometimes, it is also needed to set a tone in a school or to be responsive to victims. "It should be used tactically and strategically," he said.
Arbogast said the 94 kindergartners suspended in Prince George's last year represent a small share of those enrolled. "About 1 percent," he said. ". . .Ten percent would be crazy. One percent does not surprise me."
In Arlington County, Assistant Superintendent Meg Tuccillo said that elementary-age suspensions are rare - 13 last year across 22 schools - but that one might occur when, for example, "a youngster has significantly hurt another youngster." She added: "Sometimes, either we need time to develop a plan or we need a breathing period." 
Advocates and parents say behavior problems are sometimes signs of undiagnosed  disabilities. A second-grader with autistic-like behaviors, prone to meltdowns, was suspended for more than 10 days of kindergarten in Prince George's, his mother said, and several days of first grade. Now in second grade, the child has qualified for special education services, but he already has lost nine days to suspension and informal send-homes, his mother said. 
"It was like he was being suspended for his disability," she said. 
In general, the school system is cautious about such designations, said Arbogast, the academic chief. "You don't want to necessarily put a label on a kid at age 5," he said.
How many of the young fully grasp their punishment is hard to know.
"Some can understand the conversation, but others are looking at me, kind of smiling,  like, 'What is all this about?' " said Jointer, of Alexandria, who presides over serious suspension cases and every so often sees a kindergartner or first grader. 
Teachers describe classroom difficulties with some children lacking basic social skills, said Tim Mennuti, president of the Teachers Association of Anne Arundel County. 
In the District, Judith Sandalow, executive director of the Children's Law Center, said recent suspension cases include a kindergartner who pulled a fire alarm, a second-grader with multiple suspensions for fighting, and a third-grader accused of sexually harassing an aide.
"It is never the right answer to suspend an elementary-age child," she said.
In young children, particularly, she said, misbehavior is a sign of something deeper - family problems, learning disabilities, academic gaps. "It is a sign they are experiencing something in their lives, and they should be helped," she said.
For parents, suspensions have ripple effects. 
Thompkins, whose pre-kindergartner was suspended from Imagine Hope Community Charter School, missed work when her son was suspended and when he was less formally sent home early. "He was suspended so often I lost my job," she said.
Several calls to the charter school for comment were not returned. 
D.C. Public Charter School Board member Darren Woodruff said that charter schools have  their own disciplinary practices but that suspensions in the early grades may be an issue to examine. "We support best practices and research-based practices," he said. 
A majority of Washington area school systems suspended at least one pre-kindergartner last year, the data show. 
Last year, The Post profiled a pre-kindergarten case in Arlington in which a 3-year-old in a public Montessori program was removed for having too many potty accidents. Arlington officials said that the child was not suspended but that the family was asked to work on toilet skills at home for a period.  
In Prince William, Todd Erickson, associate superintendent for central elementary schools, said he finds the suspension totals "rather small," which "shows us we're doing a good job with the other students." He cited anti-bullying and positive-behavior efforts.
Brian Butler, a veteran Fairfax principal, said the goal of elementary-level discipline is "a teachable moment for the child."
Age is a factor, he said. "If I had a kindergartner who hit somebody," he said, "I would call the parents."

Designed by the devil, irritation built in

BYLINE: John Kelly

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B03

There's nothing like the feel of a well-designed tool in your hand, whether it's the heft of a perfectly-balanced hammer or the sleek sensuality of an iPhone. This, however, is not a column about well-designed tools. It's a column about the other kind.
Like my iron, for example. It's a Rowenta Classic, with multiple temperature settings, variable steam control and handy self-clean function. It was made in Germany, the same country that makes the Porsche. It's better at ironing my clothes than a Porsche would be, but, like a Porsche, it's also one twitchy wrist-flick away from killing me. 
The Rowenta Classic is tippy. I think that's the word an engineer would use. Its butt plate is insufficiently angled, making the iron too vertical when it's, um, vertical. Oh, there's no problem when the iron is horizontal. It takes out wrinkles faster than a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon with a 2 o'clock tee time. But rest the iron on its base on a rickety  ironing board, and it's as jiggly as a Jenga tower in an earthquake.
The very first day I used the iron, it fell from the board as I was repositioning a dress shirt. The iron plummeted over the edge and took a neat little divot from the wall on its way down. One of these days, the iron is going to tip over on my hand, leaving a classic triangular burn. I will then get to see whether the self-clean function removes cauterized flesh.
The Rowenta Classic is like a mangle in a Dickens novel or a gun in a Chekhov play: It's not a question of whether it's going to injure someone, just when. I can't understand how the industrial designers in Stuttgart or Berlin let their creation go into production. Maybe they get their shirts dry-cleaned.
Of course, Americans are capable of poor design, too. My Kenmore canister vacuum cleaner drives me crazy every time I use it, which is often, given that our dog generates roughly a bushel of loose hair every two days. Despite its QuietGuard sound technology and HEPA filtration system, the vacuum has one irritating flaw: The off switch is on the handle near where your hand goes. If your hand slips an inch down the handle - not hard to do - it hits the electronic touch control, instantly silencing the sucking beast.
This is more annoying than dangerous, but it grates. Tools should be elegant, each component doing its job, all elements coming together in a seamless whole.
Sometimes designers are just too clever for their own good. They throw in features no one wants. 
The curse of the modern machine is the beep. Everything beeps now: cars, printers, microwave ovens. . . .
We have a new Whirlpool dishwasher that seems to have a case of Tourette's. As soon as you open the door, it beeps. I guess that beep is to say, "The door is open." It continues to beep as you load the dishwasher, its way of saying, "Hey, dummy, the door's still open." And then, when you're finished loading and you shut the door, it gives one final beep.
It's that last beep that is really infuriating. Why is it necessary? I mean, why are any of them necessary - what's going to happen if the door is a tiny bit open? Is a family of raccoons going to move inside? - but why do you need that last one, after the door is closed? It's like a little slap from the dishwasher, its way of saying, "You may be human, capable of love and art and procreation, but I, a lowly dishwasher, can still make your life miserable."
My Lovely Wife really hates the dishwasher's beep. She called Whirlpool to see whether it could be silenced. Nope, the manufacturer said: It's a permanent feature.
I'm a little worried, because my wife has started studying schematic diagrams, and I suspect one day soon she's going to stab a pair of needle-nose pliers into the guts of the machine in hopes of snipping the right wire. I'm pretty sure that would void the warranty.
Whoever invented the beep - whoever invented vacuums that turn off too easily, automatic sinks that don't turn on, warm-air hand-dryers that don't dry - should be made to pay. And I have the perfect punishment: Lock them in a room full of Rowenta Classics and twist the dial to linen/cotton.

The usual suspects, but ingenious

BYLINE: Maureen Corrigan

SECTION: STYLE; Pg. C03

LENGTH: 760 words

A deserted mansion, a lonely churchyard, a village frozen in time. Throw in a corpse or two and a dogged detective, and you have the outline for the traditional British mystery novel. Detractors cry, "Formula," as if that were a flaw, but those of us who love the form know better. Indeed, one of the greatest pleasures of reading a well-crafted mystery lies in recognizing the ways a gifted author rings changes on the basic pattern. In the case of Charles Todd's mysteries, we're talking about two gifted authors: Todd, as "his" fans know, is the pseudonym for an American mother-and-son writing team that has churned out 13 previous mysteries featuring Scotland Yard Inspector Ian Rutledge, a battle-scarred veteran of World War I. What's more improbable than the collaboration is how consistently ingenious and atmospheric the Ian Rutledge novels are. 
Even given Todd's superlative track record, "The Confession" is a standout. It opens with a sly gesture to that classic film noir "D.O.A.," in which a dying man visits the police station to report a murder. (Watch the 1950 original with Edmond O'Brien, not the awful 1988 remake with Dennis Quaid.) In "The Confession," a "walking skeleton" appears at Scotland Yard on an oppressive summer's day in 1920 and tells Rutledge that he's dying of cancer and wants to clear his conscience of a murder he committed five years earlier. A few days later, the guilty man's body turns up floating in the Thames; a bullet to the back of the head killed him before the cancer could. Now Rutledge is involved in two murder investigations, with only the flimsiest of clues to guide him: the dead man's confession (which turns out to be riddled with lies) and a woman's gold locket found around the corpse's neck.
Well, that's not quite accurate. As Todd's fans know, something or someone else is always guiding Inspector Rutledge. Like many great detectives, he has a sidekick who whispers warnings and, sometimes, recriminations into his ear. Rutledge's Watson is named Hamish MacLeod; he was a corporal - and trusted friend - serving under Rutledge in France during the war. When Hamish refused a direct order to take his exhausted and bloodied men over the top in a suicidal attempt to wipe out a German machine-gun nest, Rutledge had no choice but to turn the insubordinate corporal over to a firing squad. Ever since that awful day, Hamish's spirit has followed Rutledge wherever he goes. (Whether Hamish really is a ghost or merely a hallucination of Rutledge's tortured conscience hardly matters. What does matter is that Todd manages to dramatize this eerie relationship with emotional weight and verisimilitude. We're not talking Topper here.)
It's a good thing, too, that Rutledge has company on this case, because his investigations lead him to one of the creepiest villages in all of English detective fiction: Furnham, in Essex, home to disgruntled fishermen, smugglers and hardscrabble farmers - all with a strange aversion to the tourists who are eager to spread some needed money around. When Rutledge takes his sister on an exploratory weekend drive into Furnham, they're cold-shouldered by all the natives they pass. Finally, a heavyset man approaches their roadster and says:
" 'Looking for someone?'
"Not 'Can I help you?' or 'New to Furnham, are you?'
" 'Actually,' Rutledge answered, pulling up, 'we were wondering where we might have lunch.'
"The man considered them. 'We don't run to restaurants,' he replied. 'Not here. You might find something more to your liking back the way you've come.' "
So much for the standard Merrie Olde England welcome of hot buttered scones and a cuppa. Just as uncanny as the village is the nearby manor house of River's Edge, vacant since the war and scene of a famous unsolved disappearance. Rutledge obsessively returns to this ancestral pile, surrounded by tall marsh grasses that rustle constantly and conceal eyes that watch his every hesitant move. And let's not forget the parsonage, set miles away from the church, which is itself at an odd distance from the graveyard. Why are everything and everyone in Furnham so damnably odd?
By the time these questions are resolved, the body count has mounted and Rutledge's nerves are almost shot. "The Confession" carries forward some of the best elements of the British Golden Age mysteries and proves that there's life in the old formula yet.

Maryland's near misses

BYLINE: Gene Wang

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. D03

LENGTH: 560 words

The eighth-ranked Maryland women's basketball team has had an excruciating tendency for missing layups this season, and on Sunday afternoon that failing along with careless ball security and inefficiency from the free throw line contributed to a 76-74 loss to No. 6 Miami before 11,008 at Comcast Center.
The Hurricanes went ahead for good, 73-72, with 39 seconds to play on senior forward Sylvia Bullock's jumper from the left side. Maryland had a chance to regain the lead, which it had held from midway through the first half until two minutes remained in the game, but senior guard Anjale Barrett missed a short jumper. 
Terrapins junior forward Tianna Hawkins collected the rebound and passed to Laurin Mincy, but the sophomore guard missed a three-pointer. 
Miami senior guard Shenise Johnson then made two free throws for a 75-72 lead with 23 seconds to go.
Maryland senior center Lynetta Kizer missed a pair of layups over the next 11 seconds before Miami senior guard Riquna Williams made the second of two foul shots with eight seconds to play that all but sealed the result.
The Terrapins (21-4, 8-4 ACC) missed six layups and seven free throws in the second half. They also committed 21 turnovers overall in losing for the fourth consecutive time to Miami, which got a career-high 26 points from junior guard Stefanie Yderstrom. Maryland had a three-game winning streak end, lost to the Hurricanes for the second time in a month and fell to 0-3 against the top two teams - Miami and Duke - in the ACC.
"The turnovers killed us, especially because we had some late in the game," Barrett said. "I take responsibility for that because as a point guard you're supposed to settle the team down. That last minute or so, they made plays, and we missed a couple of layups here and there, missed a couple free throws I think that ultimately determined the outcome of the game."
Maryland had five players reach double figures, with Hawkins logging a team-high 18 points and 10 rebounds and Kizer adding 16 points and a game-high 12 rebounds. Kizer, though, missed three layups in the final five minutes.
The Terrapins also got an uncharacteristically flawed performance from ACC leading scorer Alyssa Thomas. She finished with 12 points but had no field goals for the final 26 minutes 45 seconds. Last season's ACC rookie of the year shot 4 of 12 from the field, committed six turnovers and missed 4 of 8 from the line after entering as the leading free throw shooter in the conference at 88 percent.
"The good thing is those are all things we can control when we go back to practice," Maryland Coach Brenda Frese said of her team's breakdowns in fundamentals. "It allows us to focus more obviously with free throw shooting, finishing layups. Again I thought Williams and Johnson and Yderstrom were terrific down the stretch and just made some terrific plays."
That trio combined for 61 of Miami's points and made 15 of 17 from the free throw line. The Terrapins, meantime, missed 10 of 30 foul shots overall and in one sequence in the second half missed 5 of 9.
The Hurricanes (22-3, 11-1) got 20 points from Johnson, among the leading candidates for ACC player of the year, and 15 points from Williams. Each of those players added seven rebounds.
"I got some special seniors who did some amazing things to end that game," Miami Coach Katie Meier said.

A poor way to honor Rep. Giffords

SECTION: EDITORIAL COPY; Pg. A16

LENGTH: 100 words

Regarding the Feb. 11 news story "A Navy ship for Giffords":
A combat ship named after a victim of gun violence? Something is wrong with this picture.
Former Arizona representative Gabrielle Giffords is a gracious women of courage, determination and civility. Colleagues in Congress attest to her respect for other people and her ability to compromise. Rather than the Navy naming a ship after her, a more appropriate tribute would be for Congress to pass serious gun control legislation so that fewer families experience the agony of a loved one killed or wounded by a gun.

For the Cavaliers, options are limited

BYLINE: Steve Yanda

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. D01

Now is the point in the college basketball season when many teams' rotations begin to shrink. The homestretch of conference play has arrived and squads are gearing up for postseason play, when only the most reliable players will see the floor for extended minutes. 
But for Virginia Coach Tony Bennett, continually paring down his squad's rotation has not been optional for most of the season, and that may be true once again Tuesday when the Cavaliers (19-5, 6-4 ACC) play at Clemson (12-12, 4-6). Bennett said Monday that sophomore guard Joe Harris - the team's second-leading scorer and rebounder - will be a gametime decision after Harris fractured a bone in his left (non-shooting) hand over the weekend. 
No. 22 Virginia already had been operating with essentially a six-man rotation the past three weeks with senior center Assane Sene out due to a fractured ankle. While Harris will not immediately undergo corrective surgery and will make efforts to play through the discomfort the rest of the season, the injury may limit his effectiveness to a certain degree.
Consequently, the playing time of freshmen guards Malcolm Brogdon and Paul Jesperson stands to increase. Brogdon is Virginia's top reserve, while Jesperson has received limited minutes in the 13 games since the team lifted his redshirt.
"We don't have a ton of depth," Bennett said. "I'm sure a lot of people are in this boat. So you just try to make the most of it. And hopefully you get some guys that step up that maybe you weren't planning on or just play a little bigger role that can buy some time for guys as they're resting or not playing quite as many minutes."
Harris's hand was stepped on at some point during the first half of Virginia's 70-52 loss Saturday at North Carolina, though Harris ended up logging 35 minutes on the day. The player said afterward he had trouble squeezing his left hand and described the pain as stemming from the knuckles at the base of his ring and middle fingers.
For the time being, Harris will play with a protective pad on his left hand that Bennett described as a thermal plaster with a hard outer shell that covers the palm and allows only for finger movement and wrist flexion.
"I'm sure it will be a little cumbersome, but it's also got to allow for protection," Bennett said.
Harris, who is averaging 12.5 points and 4.1 rebounds per game, was not made available for comment Monday.
As much as Virginia would prefer Harris be available from a scoring standpoint, the player's potential absence might be equally felt on the boards. North Carolina out-rebounded Virginia 52-32 on Saturday, and while the foul trouble of the Cavaliers' three available big men hindered Virginia's rebounding efforts, some of their troubles were focus-based.
Bennett said there were times in the second half Saturday when the Cavaliers forgot to box out. Sophomore forward Akil Mitchell said Virginia's guards "have to come back and help [the team's post players] rebound a little bit more." At 6-foot-6, Harris plays the power forward spot when Virginia employs a four-guard lineup.
Meantime, Clemson's rebounding prospects have improved since Virginia defeated the Tigers, 65-61, on Jan. 31 in Charlottesville. At that point, junior forward Milton Jennings was suspended for academic reasons. But in the two games since he's returned to Clemson's lineup, Jennings has averaged 14.5 points and 5.5 rebounds. He is averaging 9.5 points and 5.4 rebounds on the season.
"They're a different team with [Jennings], and so we'll have to certainly account for him," Bennett said.
Who, exactly, the Cavaliers will have available remains to be seen. As of noon Monday, Bennett had yet to see Harris practice in the protective pad because the swelling in the injured hand had yet to go down.
"Rotations usually are shrinking at this time of the year for most teams," Bennett said. "Ours can't shrink much more, because we've got it about as small as it can" go.

Trying a 9-volt shortcut to expertise

BYLINE: Sally Adee

SECTION: HEALTH; Pg. E04

LENGTH: 1730 words

I'm close to tears behind my thin cover of sandbags as 20 screaming, masked men run toward me at full speed, strapped into suicide bomb vests and clutching rifles. For every one I manage to shoot dead, three new assailants pop up from nowhere. I'm clearly not shooting fast enough, and panic and incompetence are making me continually jam my rifle.
My salvation lies in the fact that my attackers are only a video, projected on screens to my front and sides. This is the simulation that trains U.S. troops to take their first steps with a rifle, and everything about it has been engineered to feel like an overpowering assault. But I am failing miserably.
Then they put the electrodes on me. 
I am in a lab in Carlsbad, Calif., in pursuit of an elusive mental state known as "flow" - that feeling of effortless concentration that characterizes outstanding performance in all kinds of skills.
Flow has been maddeningly difficult to pin down, let alone harness, but a wealth of new technologies could soon allow us all to conjure up this state. The plan is to provide a shortcut to virtuosity, slashing the amount of time it takes to master a new skill, be it tennis, playing the piano or military marksmanship.
That will be welcome news to anyone embarking on the tortuous road to expertise. According to pioneering research by Anders Ericsson at Florida State University in Tallahassee, it normally takes 10,000 hours of practice to become expert in any discipline. Over that time, your brain knits together a wealth of new circuits that eventually allow you to execute the skill automatically, without consciously considering each action. Think of the way tennis champion Roger Federer, after years of training, can gracefully combine a complicated series of actions - keeping one eye on the ball and the other on his opponent while he lines up his shot and then dispatches a crippling backhand - all in one stunningly choreographed second.
Flow typically accompanies these actions. It involves a Zenlike feeling of intense concentration, with time seeming to stop as you focus completely on the activity in hand. The experience crops up repeatedly when experts describe what it feels like to be at the top of their game, and with years of practice it becomes second nature to enter that state.

A slippery concept
Yet you don't have to be a pro to experience it: Some people report the same ability to focus at a far earlier stage in their training, suggesting they are more naturally predisposed to the flow state than others. 
This effortless concentration should speed up progress, while the joyful feelings that come with the flow state should help take the sting out of further practice, setting such people up for future success, says Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi at Claremont Graduate University in California. Conversely, his research into the flow state in children showed that, as he puts it, "young people who didn't enjoy the pursuit of the subject they were gifted in, whether it was mathematics or music, stopped developing their skills and reverted to mediocrity."
Despite its potentially crucial role in the development of talent, many researchers had deemed the flow state too slippery a concept to tackle - tainted as it was with mystical, meditative connotations. In the late 1970s, Csikszentmihalyi, then a psychologist at the University of Chicago, helped change that view by showing that the state could be defined and studied empirically. In one groundbreaking study, he interviewed a few hundred talented people, including athletes, artists, chess players, rock climbers and surgeons, enabling him to pin down four key features that characterize flow.
The first is an intense and focused absorption that makes you lose all sense of time. The second is what is known as autotelicity, the sense that the activity you are engaged in is rewarding for its own sake. The third is finding the "sweet spot," a feeling that your skills are perfectly matched to the task at hand, leaving you neither frustrated nor bored. And finally, flow is characterized by automaticity, the sense that "the piano is playing itself," for example.

Tricky to measure
Exactly what happens in the brain during flow has been of particular interest, but it has been tricky to measure. Csikszentmihalyi took an early stab at it, using electroencephalography (EEG) to measure the brain waves of expert chess players during a game. He found that the most skilled players showed less activity in the prefrontal cortex, which is typically associated with higher cognitive processes such as working memory and verbalization. That may seem counterintuitive, but silencing self-critical thoughts might allow more automatic processes to take hold, which would in turn produce that effortless feeling of flow.
Defining and characterizing the flow state is all very well, but could novices learn to turn off their critical faculties and focus their attention in this way, at will? If so, would it boost performance? Gabriele Wulf, a kinesiologist at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas, helped to answer this question in 1998, when she and her colleagues examined the way certain athletes move. 
At the time, she had no particular interest in the flow state. But Wulf and her colleagues found that they could quickly improve people's abilities by asking them to focus their attention on an external point away from their body. Aspiring skiers who were asked to do slalom-type movements on a simulator, for example, learned faster if they focused on a marked spot ahead of them. Golfers who focused on the swing of the club were about 20 percent more accurate than those who focused on their own arms.
Wulf's findings fit well with the idea that flow - and better learning - comes when you turn off conscious thought. "When you have an external focus, you achieve a more automatic type of control," she says. "You don't think about what you are doing; you just focus on the outcome."

Hooking up the brain
Might there be a way to force the brain into flow? The answer appears to be yes.
That is why I'm now allowing Michael Weisend, who works at the Mind Research Network in Albuquerque, N.M., to hook my brain up to what's essentially a nine-volt battery. He attaches the anode - the positive pole of the battery - to my temple, and the cathode to my left arm. "You're going to feel a slight tingle," he says, and warns me that if I remove an electrode and break the connection, the voltage passing through my brain will blind me for a good few seconds.
Weisend, who is working on a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency program to accelerate learning, has been using this form of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to cut the time it takes to train snipers. From the electrodes, a 2-milliamp current will run through the part of my brain associated with object recognition - an important skill when visually combing a scene for assailants.
The mild electrical shock is meant to depolarize the neuronal membranes in the region, making the cells more excitable and responsive to inputs. Like many other neuroscientists working with tDCS, Weisend thinks this accelerates formation of new neural pathways during the time that someone practices a skill. The method he is using on me boosted the speed with which would-be snipers could detect a threat by a factor of 2.3. 
Mysteriously, these changes seem to be preceded by a feeling that emerges as soon as the current is switched on and is markedly similar to the flow state. "The number-one thing I hear people say after tDCS is that time passed unduly fast," says Weisend. Their movements also seem to become more automatic; they report calm, focused concentration - and their performance improves immediately.

Why it might work
It's not yet clear why some forms of tDCS should bring about the flow state. One possibility is that the electrodes somehow reduce activity in the prefrontal cortex - the area used in critical thought, which Csikszent-mihalyi had found to be muted during flow. Roy Hamilton, a neuroscientist at the University of Pennsylvania, thinks this may happen as a side effect of some forms of tDCS. "tDCS might have much more broad effects than we think it does," he says. He points out that some neurons can mute the signals of other brain cells in their network, so it is possible that stimulating one area of the brain might reduce activity in another.
Others are more skeptical. Arne Dietrich of the American University of Beirut suspects that learning will be impaired if the frontal cortex isn't initially engaged in the task.
In any case, it is clear that not all forms of tDCS bring about flow. Roi Cohen Kadosh at the University of Oxford certainly saw no signs of it when he placed an anode over the brain regions used in spatial reasoning.
This debate will only be resolved with much more research. For now, I'm intrigued about what I'll experience as I ask Weisend to turn on the current. Initially, there is a slight tingle, and suddenly my mouth tastes like I've just licked the inside of an aluminium can. I don't notice any other effect. I simply begin to take out attacker after attacker. As 20 of them run at me brandishing their guns, I calmly line up my rifle, take a moment to breathe deeply and pick off the closest one, before tranquilly assessing my next target.
In what seems like next to no time, I hear a voice call out, "Okay, that's it." The lights come up in the simulation room and an assistant tentatively enters the room. 
In the sudden quiet amid the bodies around me, I was really expecting more assailants, and I'm a bit disappointed when the team begins to remove my electrodes. I look up and wonder if someone wound the clocks forward. Inexplicably, 20 minutes have just passed. "How many did I get?" I ask the assistant.
She looks at me quizzically. "All of them."

LENGTH: 190 words

A Maryland man was arrested Monday in the Thanksgiving weekend fatal shooting of a man outside a Dupont Circle restaurant, police said. 
Authorities picked up Brandon Terry, 29, of Riverdale on an arrest warrant about 8:15 a.m. Monday and charged him with second-degree murder while armed, police said in a statement. A court appearance is pending.
Terry is accused of shooting Jhonte Coleman, 34, of Suitland in the 1300 block of Connecticut Ave. NW about 2:30 a.m Nov. 27, police said.
That night, Coleman was atHeritage India - which was operating as an after-hours party spot - helping another friend celebrate his 30th birthday, Coleman's childhood friend Kevin Bost told The Post. A fight broke out, Bost said, and people moved onto the sidewalk, where the violence continued.
Bost said he saw a man pull a pistol from his waistband and he ran. A bullet struck Bost in the leg, but he saw Coleman on the ground. In addition to the shooting, three people were stabbed that night, police said.
After the fatal violence, Police Chief Cathy L. Lanier exercised emergency powers to close Heritage India, but it has since reopened.

Leaning on fellow officers

SECTION: EDITORIAL COPY; Pg. A16

LENGTH: 203 words

Regarding the Feb. 10 front-page article "Officers haunted by fatal shootings in the line of duty": 
For many years during my career as a police officer, I had the honor of being a peer available for talking with officers immediately after shootings and over the long term. Normally, so much effort is expended by the media and special-interest groups to fault officers in this position that no one sees what it costs the shooter to use deadly force.
The thrust of my training was to address as soon as possible the trauma these men and women suffered. Hearing from a departmental psychologist, as helpful as that can be, is different than hearing from a fellow officer who has been through the same thing. A conversation with someone who knows what it is to police the streets and has had the same type of experience adds immeasurable credibility to the message.
Believe me, the trauma of such incidents is extensive. I know many of the officers who were never the same after and, in some cases, had to retire or spiraled into a dark place. No one in these shootings comes away the same. All are changed, for good or ill, and life becomes divided into two distinct parts: before and after the shooting.

COURTS
The judge in Jerry Sandusky's child sex abuse trial granted the former Penn State assistant coach's request to have a jury composed of residents of State College and the surrounding area and gave him permission to visit with his grandchildren.
Sandusky faces 52 criminal counts for what prosecutors say was the sexual abuse of 10 boys over a 15-year period.
Sandusky, 68, was granted the right to see adult visitors, as well as his grandchildren - under their parents' supervision.
Also, a Penn State administrator asked a judge to throw out charges that he lied to the grand jury investigating Sandusky and that he failed to properly report suspected child abuse.
Tim Curley filed motions that argued the death of football coach Joe Paterno last month left prosecutors without a required second witness to support the perjury charge.
Curley, 57, is on leave as athletic director as he awaits trial. Former Penn State vice president Gary Schultz faces the same charges as Curley.

Shooting itself in the foot

BYLINE: Editorial Board

SECTION: EDITORIAL COPY; Pg. A16

LENGTH: 406 words

VIRGINIA ONCE held the dubious distinction of being the top supplier of weapons to gunrunners in the Northeast. In 1991, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) concluded that 40 percent of some 1,200 handguns collected from New York crime scenes had come from Virginia. Guns from the commonwealth were also routinely recovered from crime scenes in the District. One reason for the allure of Virginia's weaponry: a state law that allowed unlimited purchases of handguns. 
That trend reversed after Virginia enacted a one-gun-a-month limit on purchases to address the gunrunning problem in 1993. In 1995, a pro-gun lawmaker gave the Virginia State Crime Commission the task of studying the limit's impact. The commission found that the law had significantly reduced the number of Virginia guns found at crime scenes beyond its borders. A contemporaneous studyby the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence (now known as the Brady Center) showed that the limit reduced by 66 percent the number of Virginia-bought guns recovered from crimes scenes in the Northeast corridor. The authors of the study, which was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, concluded that it "provides evidence that restricting handgun purchases to 1 per month is an effective means of disrupting the illegal interstate transfer of firearms." Rounding things out, the ATF knocked Virginia off the top of the list of leading exporter of crime guns; Georgia claimed the top spot.
The law worked, which is why it is unfathomable that the state is on the verge of throwing it out. Both chambers of the legislature approvedeliminating the one-gun-a-month limit last week. The only thing standing in the way of the bill becoming law is the signature of Gov. Robert F. McDonnell (R), who voted for the limit as a state delegate but has since reversed course.
Virginia advocates of repeal argue that limiting law-abiding state residents to one purchase per month spits in the face of their Second Amendment rights. Does the Second Amendment guarantee a right to purchase dozens, hundreds, maybe thousands of deadly weapons each month? Even with the one-gun-a-month limit, collectors and those who showed a need for additional guns for personal or business protection were permitted to petition the state for an exception; most of these requests were approved.
To discard a law that has been effective for almost 20 years makes no sense.

Jury selection began Monday in the murder trial of five District men charged in a series of 2010 shootings that left five dead. 
More than 70 prospective jurors were interviewed Monday, and another 140 are scheduled to be interviewed Tuesday and Wednesday as lawyers and D.C. Superior Court Judge Ronna Beck try to pick 12 jurors and five alternates. 
Beck said the trial could last up to three months. More than 50 of the 72 people in the first pool of possible jurors raised their hands Monday when asked whether a lengthy trial might present scheduling conflicts. "We do need people to serve on this jury," Beck told them.   Jury selection is expected to continue through Thursday. Opening arguments are scheduled for Feb. 21.
Orlando Carter, 22; his brother, Sanquan, 21; Jeffrey D. Best, 23; Robert Bost, 23; and Lamar Williams, 23, are charged with first-degree murder and other offenses in the attacks.

Man charged with killing Md. trooper wanted 'revenge,' prosecutors say

BYLINE: Matt Zapotosky

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B01

LENGTH: 716 words

Maryland State Trooper Wesley Brown could have arrested the disorderly Applebee's patron instead of throwing him out of the restaurant, prosecutors said. The man had tried to punch another officer and then ran from the scene. Even the other officer thought it might be best to bring him in, prosecutors said.
But Brown had told his partner that night in June 2010 to "just let him go," prosecutors said. And some time later, Cyril Williams returned and fired a .45-caliber handgun toward the Applebee's door, fatally wounding Brown as he stepped outside to make a phone call, prosecutors said. 
"The defendant was planning to exact his revenge on these police officers that threw him out of the restaurant," Prince George's Deputy State's Attorney Tara Harrison told jurors in her opening statement at Williams's trial this week. "The defendant did, in fact, exact revenge on Trooper Wesley Brown."
Williams, 29, is charged with first-degree murder and other related counts in the June 11, 2010, slaying of Brown outside the Applebee's on Donnell Drive in Forestville. Dozens of his and Brown's family members, police commanders and uniformed troopers filled a Prince George's County Circuit courtroom this week. 
So far, the trial has been an emotional affair. Patrice Faison, Brown's sister, tearfully told jurors about how her brother had started a mentoring group for youths in the Seat Pleasant area. Karl Peoples, the Maryland Parole and Probation officer whom Brown was working with that night, talked about how he tried awkwardly to help his wounded partner through the door after he had been shot.
But William C. Brennan Jr., Williams's defense attorney, said that although his client might have been thrown out of Applebee's, prosecutors did not have enough evidence to prove that he came back and shot Brown. He said that prosecutors do not have any DNA or fingerprint evidence and that no unbiased witnesses saw Williams back at the restaurant after he was ejected. The case hinges, Brennan said, on whether jurors believe two jailhouse informants and the man whose gun was used to shoot Brown. 
That man, Anthony Milton, 29, has pleaded guilty to being an accessory after the fact to  murder and has yet to be sentenced. Brennan said Milton, who prosecutors say was with Williams near the restaurant shortly before the shooting,  initially lied to detectives. Brennan said his client had no motive to shoot the trooper.
"Getting thrown out of an Applebee's does not equate to first-degree murder," Brennan said. 
In the first two days of Williams's trial, prosecutors focused largely on setting the scene for Brown's slaying. The 24-year-old state trooper was working security off-duty with Peoples, watching over Applebee's patrons who were downing drinks and singing karaoke, according to people who were there. At some point, said a woman who was there, someone complained about Williams.
Brown and Peoples took Williams outside, telling him it would be best for him to leave, according to prosecutors' and Peoples's accounts. At first, Williams went willingly and agreed to pay his check after a waiter brought it outside, said prosecutors and Peoples. But Peoples said that Williams soon became agitated, gesturing so vigorously that his hands were hitting Brown, then taking a swing at Peoples. 
Peoples told jurors that he initially wanted to arrest Williams but let him go at his partner's suggestion. After he and Brown returned to the restaurant, Peoples testified, he  told Brown that they should sometimes make arrests.
Later, Peoples said he heard what sounded like firecrackers and saw his partner stumbling toward the doorway. Brown had been shot. 
Two D.C. firefighters and a nurse inside the restaurant performed CPR until an ambulance arrived, but their efforts were in vain. Brown never regained a pulse. 
"I'm frustrated," Peoples said of how he felt that night. "I'm mad. I'm still mad right now." 
Prosecutors said Williams was the shooter. They said he had gotten the .45-caliber handgun that night from Milton, a friend of his. They said Williams went to Milton's house after his initial confrontation with the officers to pick up the gun, telling his friend, "Remember that forty-five? I need that."
Williams's trial is expected to last until Thursday.

Knights' Burgess provides necessary jump in overtime

BYLINE: James Wagner

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. D05

LENGTH: 420 words

The jumping ability that propelled St. Mary's Ryken junior guard Brittani Burgess around defenders to the basket and to several loose balls in overtime of Tuesday's Washington Catholic Athletic Conference game against Paul VI is mostly natural, she insists, aided some by working out. 
"Britt's got hops for days," said St. Mary's Ryken senior guard Katie McCormick, with an embarrassed Burgess within earshot. "She'll be dunking in a sec."
Burgess, a wiry 5-foot-10 guard, used an attacking style and relentless rebounding to net six  points and five rebounds in overtime to power St. Mary's Ryken over visiting Paul VI, 59-53, in Leonardtown.
Burgess said she was "a little nervous. I didn't want to rush too much but I did a little. But at the end we won, and a win is a win, so I'm not complaining."
The evenly matched teams traded blows for much of the game. No team led by more than six points. St. Mary's Ryken (15-9, 9-8) led 21-19 at the half before Paul VI grabbed a 33-31 lead after three quarters.
Playing without standout sophomore forward Ariana Freeman (18.2 points per game), who injured her ankle in the Panthers' game on Friday, Paul VI relied on sharpshooting guards Marlena Tremba (20 points) and Lindsey Oblitey (15 points). 
The Panthers (18-8, 11-6) closely guarded McCormick, the Knights' standout shooter, forcing Burgess and junior post Cydney Smith (15 points) to carry the scoring. Smith proved difficult for Paul VI defenders to contain around the basket, collecting 13 points and 10 rebounds.
Trailing 48-44, Knights senior Tyler Smith drove through the lane and made a layup with 32 seconds left in regulation. After junior Marissa Somerville and Burgess forced Paul VI to turn the ball over on the next play, Burgess tied the game at 48 on a jumper with 20 seconds left.
In overtime, Burgess netted the Knights' first points by making a tough layup and drawing a foul. She drew a foul after later pulling down a defensive rebound. Then, she followed up her own miss on the offensive end by jumping around defenders for the ball and laying it in and drawing a foul. She hit the free throw for a 54-53 lead with 1 minute 31 seconds left.
McCormick added a three-pointer with 43 seconds left for added cushion. 
"I know Brittani because she's one of the other guards that carries this team," said McCormick, a Georgetown recruit who finished with 11 points. "I mean, next year this is going to be her team. I knew she was going to pick it up. She did a great job and got and-ones."

Watergate, plumbed for wit

BYLINE: Ron Charles

SECTION: STYLE; Pg. C01

LENGTH: 1682 words

Early in Thomas Mallon's new novel about the Watergate scandal, President Nixon's secretary wonders when her boss will get his own marble temple on the Mall. It's the sort of arresting moment of naivete that frequently punctuates this witty, surprisingly humane dramatization of that vaudevillian chapter in American politics.
Four decades have passed since five bungling burglars were arrested in the Democratic National Committee headquarters, indelibly contaminating a posh commercial-residential complex with the stink of our nation's most bizarre political ordeal. Many of the participants have served their time (in prison and on television), written their best-selling memoirs, and passed into those great 181 / 2 minutes of oblivion. After Irangate, Whitewatergate, Monicagate and evenNipplegate, the scandal-infused suffix gets tossed around now by people who weren't even born when the sweaty president looked into the TV cameras and claimed, "I'm not a crook." 
The time is right, then, for a novelist to bring us together again, and perhaps no one is better equipped than this Washington-based writer who has blended political history and speculation so effectively in such books as "Dewey Defeats Truman,""Henry and Clara" and "Fellow Travelers." Running up and down what he calls "the always sliding scale of historical fiction," Mallon entices us back to those frenzied pre-Internet days of the Dictabelt, the smoking gun, the hush money, the Saturday Night Massacre, the Enemies List, Deep Throat, CREEP and "expletive deleted" - the whole, labyrinthine episode that newly sworn-in President Gerald Ford too expansively characterized as "an American tragedy in which we all have played a part."
While staying close to the chronology of events, Mallon distinguishes his story from the library of books that have come before by shaping "Watergate" in his own inimitable way. Nixon's the one, of course, and all the spiteful principals are here, too, caught by the author's delectable humor, from H.R. Haldeman, "the castle's ogre," to Chuck Colson, "a kind of mad relative who needed to be kept out of sight." But Mallon has rotated the cast of characters, pulling some stars out of the limelight and raising others into new prominence. Henry Kissinger just creeps around the edges of the story, "underlining his every offhand insight with some guttural profundity or toadying compliment." Although you might expect G. Gordon Liddy to be the zany court jester in a comedy about Watergate, he's mostly offstage here. And those of us suckled on the legend of Woodward and Bernstein will be surprised to find The Washington Post - "Kay's rag" - reduced to a little footnote in this version of the tale.
Instead, Mallon's "Watergate" places presidential aide Fred LaRue, "the bagman," at the center, not as the instigator but as the troubled conscience of the novel. A wealthy, unflappably gracious Mississippi oilman, LaRue is the story's Nick Carraway, always within and without. He conspires to protect the president even as he hopes to save his own soul, haunted because he shot his father during a hunting trip in Canada years earlier. History, Mallon suggests, is not a clash of titans but just the magnified effects of ordinary people's secret longings and fears.
That's nowhere more evident than in the novel's discerning portrayal of Richard Nixon, who limps through these pages with his eyes fixed on the future. Baffled by the animus of his critics, pained to hurt anyone's feelings, and haunted by the ghost of his dead brother, the president struggles to maintain his "madly dissociative smile" while hoping that the transcripts of his genius eventually place him in the pantheon of American leaders. It's a brilliant presentation, subtle and sympathetic but spiked with satire that captures the man in all his crippling self-consciousness, his boundless capacity for self-pity and re-invention. Clinging to "the power of Dr. Peale's positive thinking," he sometimes sees himself as Christ crucified, sometimes as Eichmann in a glass cage. Mallon peers deep into "this darkest of dark horses, this misanthrope in a flesh-presser's profession, able to succeed from cunning and a talent for denying reality at close range." By the end, this Nixon is no Macbeth; he's more King Lear, penniless and raving on the wild heath of political disgrace.
But no matter how perceptive his portrayal of Nixon, LaRue, Howard Hunt or Elliot Richardson, to a great extent Mallon has turned the story of Watergate into a story of the women involved. Nowhere is he more discerning than in his depiction of Martha Mitchell, the erratic wife of the attorney general; Rose Mary Woods, the president's ferociously loyal secretary; and Dorothy Hunt, who blackmails the "plumbers" while her husband mingles old stories of his CIA days with plots for his spy novels. They're all captivatingly powerful "gals," trapped in their own chauvinistic ideals, fighting to defend their men past all reason. Pat Nixon, especially, becomes the novel's tragic heroine. She's exhausted by the struggles of politics, disgusted by journalists' casual meanness, desperate for a life of kindness and romance she once briefly enjoyed.
And all these women are outshone by Mallon's hilarious resurrection of Alice Longworth, the sharp-tongued daughter of Teddy Roosevelt, "a creature of motiveless mischief" whose needlepoint pillow admonishes guests, "If you can't say something good about someone, sit right here by me." (Indeed, Longworth's astringent tone flavors the narrative as a whole. Like the "old crone," Mallon can deliver fatal shots to the base of the ego with just a single phrase.) Pulling generously from the record of Longworth's quips and put-downs, the author uses her as an ironic gargoyle in a wide-brimmed hat peering down from Dupont Circle on the capital's parade of vanity and intrigue. No one escapes her tongue. Florida Sen. Edward Gurney looks like "a tennis pro who had just retired to become the hotel gigolo." In the wake of two prominent senators' respective scandals - Chappaquiddick and psychotherapy - she dubs Ted Kennedy and Thomas Eagleton "Waterproof and Shockproof." At Art Buchwald's birthday party, she greets the popular humorist by saying, "If I'd ever read your column, I'd quote you a line or two from it."
The novel expands creatively on Longworth's friendship with Nixon and imagines him as her "kindred spirit," the two of them sharing some of the story's most poignant moments. Scores of people were eventually convicted, but "the little cloak and dagger foolishness of Watergate" doesn't impress Longworth much; she remembers real crises, when "legless Civil War veterans [were] begging in the streets." That long-range historical perspective combined with her acidic wit conveys the novel's implicit argument that there's something absurd about a country as freighted with responsibilities and challenges as ours tearing itself apart over this cheap crime.
But despite the investigative evidence available, Mallon's reconstruction of events defuses blame - not to excuse anyone in particular but to convey the mad chaos that sweeps up all the president's men. No matter how Machiavellian Haldeman pretends to be, there is no master plot, no puppeteer, no grand scheme behind all these shenanigans. In the constantly shifting perspectives of "Watergate," we can see that no one knows where the idea for the break-in came from - Liddy? Jeb Magruder? One of Hunt's spy thrillers? The coverup isn't a conspiracy so much as a farce of misdirection and self-delusion, as everyone jockeys in the dark for advancement or plea bargains or book deals or positions in the next administration.
But beware: This novel is strictly BYOW (Bring Your Own Wikipedia). Unless you actually participated in the break-in, "Watergate" will challenge your memory of those internecine months before the president resigned. The author of seven previous novels, Mallon has never before taken on a subject so voluminously over-documented, and he expects his readers to have bloodied their fingertips in the archives. He has no more use for exposition than Haldeman had for alcohol (and if you don't get that joke, consider yourself warned). Political references and allusions fall from these pages as thickly as confetti at the Republican convention; catch them if you can. Even by Washington standards, this is the name-droppiest novel I've ever read - like having lunch at Charlie Palmer's with the most ambitious congressional aide in the District. The advent of e-readers will make it easy for Washington's elder elite to search for themselves in these chapters, and Mallon may find himself on several new Enemies Lists. (He certainly won't be getting Christmas cards from Patrick Buchanan, Dick Durbin or the senior George Bush.)
His decision to focus so intensely on the interior story of the Watergate participants saves Mallon the trouble of retelling the history that's been told (and lied about) before. But it also produces a novel that's daringly undramatic. Essentially everything here happens off-stage, from the break-in all the way to - spoiler alert! - the pardon. There's no drama from the Senate hearings, no journalistic derring-do. The book remains compelling only because Mallon writes with such wit and psychological acuity as he spins this carousel of characters caught in a scandal that's constantly fracturing into new crises.
Indeed, despite the country-shaking events constantly breaking in the background, this remains a novel of conversation and introspection, the dark fears of the famous and the humble. Mallon captures all the strange people who "made the Watergate a whole damned world unto itself," but he also makes that world seem very small. It's a dramatic reminder that, as Tip O'Neill was fond of saying, all politics is local.

With drug case, a window on relentless D.C. gang violence

BYLINE: Del Quentin Wilber

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A01

LENGTH: 1198 words

When Crystal Washington checked out of her halfway house and stepped into a gray April morning, the gunman was ready.
He silently slipped behind Washington as she crossed a busy street at rush hour, then he pulled out a semiautomatic pistol and fired six shots at point-blank range, killing the 44-year-old mother of four. 
It would not take long for authorities to piece together a motive - Washington, a recovering drug addict, was a key prosecution witness at the looming trial of the gunman's boss, an alleged Southeast Washington narcotics kingpin.
The slaying in 2009 soon sparked an undercover FBIinvestigation straight out of the HBO series "The Wire" that would lead to charges against 13alleged members of a Southeast drug gang. On Feb. 1, the trial of three of those people began in the District's federal court. Six defendants have pleaded guilty; the dispositions of four others could not be determined from court records. 
The investigation provides a rare window into an organization that dominated a vibrant open-air drug market in Southeast, a gang that stopped at nothing to protect its turf. The case also helps explain the city's stubborn level of violence. Although homicides have plummeted in the District (last year, city police tallied 108 killings, nearly half the number recorded in 2004), authorities say they are still battling an intractable cycle that fuels the city's murders - territorial disputes and retaliation for snubs and other acts of violence.
In the case of the Southeast gang, prosecutors say, its ringleader, Mark Pray, thought little of conspiring to kill Washington, a woman he had known for years. A few months later, prosecutors say, Pray and his chief "enforcer" - the same man accused of shooting Washington - agreed to eliminate a rival dealer because that man's brother had shot one of Pray's lieutenants. 
And, in 2008, angered that another dealer had disrespected one of his associates, Pray participated in a drive-by shooting: He popped out of the sun roof of a speeding Cadillac, whipped out two semiautomatic pistols and littered a major street with 27 bullets that riddled another car and killed his intended target, prosecutors say. 
"This is a case about greed," federal prosecutor Matthew Cohen of the District's U.S. attorney's office told jurors. "It's a case about the greed that drove the defendants to sell drugs in this community. . . . These co-conspirators took human life to help each other. They were part of a group with a common purpose that committed a series of acts that included drug dealing and murder."
The three defendants, Pray, 31, his alleged enforcer, Alonzo Marlow, 30, and Kenneth Benbow, 31, have denied involvement in any homicides. Their attorneys have argued to jurors that the government's evidence is ambiguous and not as strong as prosecutors have said. They also have criticized what they have called sloppy police work. 
According to court papers, prosecutors and testimony in a trial that is expected to last eight weeks, the investigation can be traced to Washington's rowhouse in the Barry Farm public housing project, a cluster of drab, white-and-beige two-story units nestled near Interstate 295 and south of Suitland Parkway. The neighborhood has long endured the violence and social ills associated with being an open-air drug market - one that prosecutors say Pray and his organization had come to dominate by 2005. 
To hide his product from police, Pray took over other people's houses, and that is what led him to Washington, prosecutors say. In exchange for drugs, prosecutors say, Washington allowed Pray and his cohorts to pack, process and store PCP, crack cocaine and marijuana in her home in the 1200 block of Eaton Road. He and his dealers also hid guns in the house - in fact, Washington's 12-year-old son even found two rifles stashed in the laundry room, the mother later told a grand jury.
One evening in September 2006, after returning home from the grocery store, Washington paid Pray $80 for a cigarette dipped in PCP and went upstairs to get high, court papers show. 
Within hours, prosecutors say, police responded to an anonymous call from a woman complaining about "unwanted guests" in the house; authorities would later determine that the call was placed by Washington's teenage daughter.
When officers arrived, they said they found Pray sitting at a kitchen table that was covered with 14 half-ounce vials of PCP, 36 Ziploc bags of marijuana, 4.8 grams of cocaine, a digital scale and $230 in cash. Police also recovered two rifles and a semiautomatic handgun with rubber bands strapped to its grip, an effort to prevent fingerprints from being left on the weapon.
Pray, Washington and several others were arrested and charged. Washington eventually agreed to cooperate with authorities in exchange for a lesser sentence. As a condition of her release, Washington lived in the halfway house in the 1400 block of G Street NE.
After her slaying just three days before Pray's trial, prosecutors say, the case evaporated because there was no way for them to prove that the guns and drugs belonged to the alleged dealer. As investigators dug into the killing, they got lucky and discovered that Marlow was wearing a court-ordered ankle bracelet that used a Global Positioning System device to track his location. The bracelet tracked him to within just a few feet of Washington when she was slain, according to prosecutors, who allege that Pray conspired to have her executed.
Within weeks of Washington's death, prosecutors say, federal agents launched an investigation of Pray and his gang. They sent  undercover informants to purchase PCP and other drugs - capturing the deals on video. Agents also tapped Pray's phones, an investigative technique that allowed them to arrest his alleged heroin supplier in Baltimore and to better understand how his organization worked - after agents deciphered the dealers' code. Apparently worried that their calls were being monitored, the dealers routinely called Barry Farm "Noya," PCP "munga" and cocaine "Joe." Handguns were "pocket rockets," and Pray's flashy black Lexus was known as "the Bat," prosecutors say.
Like many street gangs, authorities say, Pray's organization had to fight for its turf. In July 2009, one of Pray's trusted lieutenants was wounded in Barry Farm by a rival. When Marlow, incarcerated in an unrelated case, got out of prison Dec. 30, prosecutors say, one of the first people he called was Pray. "Help is on the way," he told him, according to prosecutors.
Looking to retaliate, Marlow began hunting for the assailant, only to learn that the man was in jail. Instead, Marlow turned his attention to the attacker's brother, prosecutors say. 
On the morning of Jan. 13, 2010, Marlow spotted the brother in Barry Farm and soon was on the phone with Pray, telling him that he was making a "work call," prosecutors say. Slipping into code, they talked about killing the man, prosecutors say, and Pray recommended that Marlow wear a hooded sweatshirt so nobody would recognize him.
Fifty minutes later, the brother was dead. 
Again, prosecutors say, Marlow blundered: He was wearing a GPS ankle bracelet.

20 years later,a charge in slaying
A 37-year-old South Carolina man has been arrested and charged in a homicide that occurred in East Potomac Park almost 20 years ago, the D.C. police said Tuesday.  
They said Lamont Deshawn Terry of Columbia, S.C., was arrested on a warrant in January, and brought to the District on Monday, where he was charged with felony murder while armed in the death of Chet Hunter Matthews, 27, of Washington.
Police said Matthews was found fatally shot about 11 p.m., May 25, 1992, in the 1100 block of Ohio Drive SW, near the 14th Street Bridge and the U.S. Park Police station. News accounts from 1992 described Matthews as a letter carrier who worked from the Wheaton station of the U.S. Postal Service.

Class-action suitwill go forward
The District has lost an effort to have a federal judge throw out a class-action suit brought on behalf of nearly 3,000 nursing home residents.
Judge Ellen Huvelle on Tuesday rejected the city's claim that it has complied with the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) by providing services to nursing home residents who want to live in the community. The ADA requires states and local governments to provide services to people with disabilities in the most integrated setting possible.
Huvelle ruled that the District's claims fell short of those requirements on several fronts, including that the city has no meaningful plan to integrate nursing home residents into community settings. 
The case, Day v. the District of Columbia, was brought by University Legal Services, AARP Foundation Litigation and Arent Fox LLP.

In Huguely case, all the elements of a trial we want to watch

BYLINE: Paul Farhi

SECTION: STYLE; Pg. C01

LENGTH: 1052 words

In a famous essay about crime and the British press, George Orwell identified the kinds of murder cases that excited the news media and titillated the public. The victims, he wrote, tended to be middle-class; the alleged perpetrators were seemingly respectable members of the community; the motives were typically sexual or romantic in nature. And none of the cases was open and shut, leaving ample room to speculate about the outcome.
That was another time (1946) and another place (postwar Britain), but the enormous media attention accorded the George Huguely-Yeardley Love murder trial in Charlottesville suggests not much has changed. 
More than 200 reporters, photographers and TV producers are credentialed to cover the trial, according to Ric Barrick, a spokesman for the City of Charlottesville. 
In addition to local outlets, including The Post and the Baltimore Sun (Huguely is from Chevy Chase; Love was from the Baltimore area), the trial has received extensive national coverage. Among those who've registered to cover it are representatives from the three broadcast networks' morning shows, CNN, "48 Hours," "Dateline," "20/20," the New York Times, the New York Post, the Wall Street Journal and several authors researching books on the case. The Times of London is covering it, too.
The only thing that's stopped the case from turning into a full-blown circus (think Casey Anthony) is Judge Edward Hogshire's decision to ban TV cameras from his courtroom.
Why, in a nation that averages more than 15,000 homicides a year, do a few crimes or trials gain such attention?
The answer may be in Orwell's basic formulation, with a few contemporary American wrinkles thrown in.
First, to build sustained interest over the many weeks of an investigation and trial, the  outcome must be in doubt, says Scot Safon, executive vice president of theHLN cable network, which often broadcasts live trials. As in Orwell's day, crimes that are resolved quickly, where guilt and innocence aren't at issue, don't rate much attention, he notes. In Huguely's case, the question is whether he is guilty of first-degree murder. 
Safon denies that factors such as the race, wealth, age and telegenic qualities of the victim or the accused are critical. "I have never been part of a discussion where race or class or looks was a determinant of how much time and attention we would give to the case," he says.
But the record of recent years suggests otherwise. Almost all of the great media spectacles surrounding crime and punishment in America over the past 30 years or so have involved one or more of the following: young white women, celebrities or wealthy people.
A short list of the most notorious trials includes those of Claus von Bulow; "Scarsdale diet doctor" murderer Jean Harris; the Menendez brothers; O.J. Simpson; Scott Peterson; Phil Spector; Amanda Knox; Casey Anthony; and Conrad Murray, the physician who was convicted last fall of involuntary manslaughter in the death of Michael Jackson (whose trial on child molestation charges was a sensation in 2005).
"Race, gender, youth and attractiveness are all factors in whose stories are found to be media-worthy," said Sheri L. Parks, an American studies professor at the University of Maryland. In Love's case, she said, "the vigorous young athlete turns into the imperiled damsel in distress. . . . Young, white and attractive women are often positioned this way" not just in the news but in TV shows, movies and books, such as the popular "Twilight" series.
Huguely overturns a stereotype, she suggests: "Instead of the mythical black male stranger, the face of the suspected villain is becoming that of the white boyfriend [or] husband." In that sense, Parks says, the media narrative is moving toward matching the crime statistics: Women have always been more likely to be attacked by men of their own race, and by men they already know.
Huguely, 24, and Love, 22, both students at the University of Virginia, fit the media template almost perfectly. She was an attractive young white woman, a promising student and athlete. Huguely is the handsome, athletic scion of a wealthy family with deep roots in the Washington area; he attended the Landon School, an exclusive prep school in Bethesda. Enhancing the narrative of privilege and prestige, they attended an elite university and played intercollegiate lacrosse, a sport often associated with wealthy private institutions.
James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University, points out that the media are often attracted to victims deemed vulnerable. This explains why there's enormous coverage of school shootings, but not of those that occur in other offices, which tend to involve adults. It also lies behind the so-called Missing White Girl Syndrome, in which the disappearance of young, middle-class white women - Polly Klaas, Chandra Levy, Elizabeth Smart, Natalee Holloway, Jaycee Dugard - attracts far more attention than similar cases involving men, women from minority backgrounds or older people.
Critics see this at work in other circumstances, too. Pfc. Jessica Lynch - young, pretty, white - drew inordinate attention at the start of the Iraq war in 2003 when she was injured and taken prisoner during an attack on her convoy. The media gave far less attention to two other soldiers who were part of the same convoy: Shoshana Johnson, a young African American woman, and Lori Piestewa, a Native American. Johnson was injured and taken prisoner like Lynch. Piestewa was killed, becoming the first Native American woman in history to die in combat for the U.S. military.
"The media doesn't operate in a vacuum. It tends to give the readers what they're interested in," Fox says. "Most readers and viewers are white. They identify with crimes involving white people. When it's a black person, unfortunately, they don't identify with the victim."
Indeed, as in Orwell's day, media interest is far from blind or equal. Last week, as Huguely went to trial with TV cameras and reporters on his heels, a D.C. Superior Court judge sentenced 20-year-old Kwan Kearney to 60 years in prison for first-degree murder in the shooting of Joseph Sharps Jr., a student at Spingarn High School, in 2010.
Never heard of Kearney or Sharps?
Exactly.

Gutted park is preferred

BYLINE: Natalie McGill

SECTION: METRO; Pg. T21

LENGTH: 769 words

Plans to revitalize Glenarden's Seventh Street Park - gutted several years ago because of complaints about loitering and sexual activity - have some of the city's Ward 3 residents concerned that new benches and grills will invite old behaviors.
Ward 3 residents say adding things such as park benches to beautify the now-empty former playground will make it easier for drug sales and, in some cases, for people to have sex. 
The city administration applied for and received a $28,000 state grant from the state's Department of Natural Resources last year to renovate the vacant playground as an effort to enhance city parks, said Councilwoman Margaret Dade (Ward 2).
Councilwoman Jennifer Jenkins (Ward 3) is planning a 7 p.m. Feb. 24 public forum at the James R. Cousins Jr. Municipal Center for residents to voice their concern after a sudden increase in residents telling her they were not in favor of the park.
Gracie Briggs, a Seventh Street resident since 1964, said the lot has been in decline for the past 18 years. She would rather see a single-family house built on the land instead or plants and shrubs if nothing else. She doesn't want to see any place to sit or a restroom.
The original plan called for amenities such as picnic tables, landscaping, a wheelchair-accessible portable toilet and charcoal grills, Jenkins said. 
"It wouldn't be there a month before it was turned over," Briggs said of a portable toilet. "We don't have a park force like [Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission] has a force to go and clean it. So who's going to clean it? What would I be smelling as soon as the public got through it?"
Glenarden does not have its own parks and recreation department. 
The city removed benches and swings from the park in 2004 because of resident complaints, said Verley Wilson, a former councilwoman and a Ward 3 resident. Glenarden Police Chief Philip O'Donnell, who has been in this post since 2008, said it has been a long time since he has received resident complaints about the park, but he did not have statistics on how many calls he received on average. 
Jenkins said she talked to as many Seventh Street residents as she could because she knew there were a few residents who did not want to see anything at all in the lot.
"All of them said they would welcome having something nice there, but they had concerns about kids that would hang out and loiter," Jenkins said.
Jenkins said she would not want to have a project that would cause residents sleepless nights. However, she said, the money could be used for some type of enhancement, because people continued to loiter there regardless of the absence of park equipment.
Donald Bell, Glenarden's interim city manager, contacted the Department of Natural Resources, which said the city can stray from some of its original ideas. Jenkins's suggestions include fencing in the area, closing the park at dusk and surveillance cameras.
But using the money for another location is not an option, and Jenkins said she hopes the money would not have to be returned to the state. The city has until September to spend the money and plans to spend it before the deadline based on what residents want there, Bell said in an e-mail.
"These are the type of things that make it difficult to get larger government bodies to help us," Jenkins said. "They want a definitive plan, and they want to see people move forward on these plans."
O'Donnell said surveillance cameras would not be feasible, because no one would be around to monitor them. If any part of the grant were used for cameras, he doubts money would be left over for the other planned amenities.
However, O'Donnell said, he and 10 officers have picked up patrols there at Jenkins's and residents' request. 
"It's been somewhat of a lovers' lane," O'Donnell said of the park area. "There were complaints about kids going down there smoking marijuana. I would go down there in the morning and couldn't find any evidence in the street like marijuana cigarettes." 
He said one of the major problems was a Seventh Street home that was the source of drug sales last year. In September, Glenarden police served a search warrant on the home that resulted in three arrests and recovered firearms. 
O'Donnell said that since the warrant was served, there has been less criminal activity but that Seventh Street is a vibrant street in general, with people out and about and on their porches.
"I'm up there five times a day, personally, and the officers have to go through there in the evening, and they have to mark on their sheets how many times they go through there," he said.

Even armored SUV couldn't save U.S. agent

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY

MEXICO CITY - When U.S. Special Agent Jaime Zapata wasshot dead one year agoon a notorious stretch of highway in central Mexico, he was driving a $160,000 armored Chevy Suburban, built to exacting government standards, designed to defeat high-velocity gunfire, fragmentation grenades and land mines.
But the vehicle had a basic, fatal flaw.
Forced off the road in a well-coordinated ambush, surrounded by drug cartel gunmen brandishing AK-47s, Zapata and his partner, Victor Avila, rolled to a stop. Zapata put the vehicle in park. 
The door locks popped open.
That terrifying sound - a quiet click - set into motion events that remain under investigation. When Zapata needed it most, the Suburban's elaborate armoring was rendered worthless by a consumer-friendly automatic setting useful for family vacations and hurried commuters but not for U.S. agents driving through a red zone in Mexico.
The Feb. 15, 2011, killing of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Special Agent Zapata - the first U.S. officer to die in the line of duty here since 1985 - is described by American officials today as a watershed in the U.S.-backed drug war and proof that the United States is paying in blood as well as treasure. 
His death has put new focus on the expanding role that a growing number of U.S. law enforcement officials now play in Mexico, where they operate in an increasingly complex, dangerous environment - yet are prohibited by Mexican law from carrying firearms to protect themselves.
Piecemeal accounts of the attack have trickled out over the past year, but the U.S. government has not made public key details about the circumstances that led to Zapata's death. It is still unclear why the agents were sent down a stretch of highway where gangs were known to roam, because they could have flown or traveled with an armed escort of Mexican military or police, a routine matter.
But in interviews with U.S. lawmakers, senior law enforcement officials and security experts, it appears the officers were sent on a dangerous mission in a vehicle whose basic protections were disastrously flawed.
Had the door locks not opened at that moment, "Zapata would probably still be alive today," said Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Tex.), a former U.S. prosecutor who is pressing U.S. agencies to clarify what happened in the attack, in which Avila was wounded.
There are hundreds, if not thousands, of other armored U.S. government vehicles all over the world that may also have this vulnerability, potentially leaving American diplomats and officers at grave risk.
The Bureau of Diplomatic Security, which is responsible for outfitting the secure vehicles used by American embassies, declined to comment on the status of their locking mechanisms.
But when McCaul visited Afghanistan last month and rode in an armored State Department Suburban, he said he paid close attention to what happened when the vehicle went into park.
The doors unlocked.

The ambush
Zapata, 32, was only nine days into a temporary assignment in Mexico when he was killed, according to his family. He told his worried parents back home in Brownsville, Tex., that he would be stationed at the U.S. Embassy, pushing paper in the relative safety of Mexico City.
Instead he was at the wheel of a Suburban with tinted windows, barreling through the scrublands along Highway 57 to courier what U.S. officials describe as a piece of "sensitive electronic equipment" from Monterrey to Mexico City.
It is a busy four-lane highway. But it is also at the heart of what longtime U.S. agents consider a perilous region, ruled by the carjackers, kidnappers, dope smugglers and hit squads who work for the most violent criminal organization in Mexico, Los Zetas.
The two agents were confident enough to stop along the road at a Subway sandwich shop. It was there that U.S. officials say lookouts for the Zetas probably spotted what appeared to them to be two young, well-built Mexicans, speaking fluent Spanish and driving the exact kind of sport-utility vehicle that attracts attention here, a vehicle favored by three types of drivers: government officials, wealthy elites and powerful gangsters.
A couple of dozen miles south of the state capital of San Luis Potosi, the agents realized they were being followed. Driving aggressively, in front and back, two SUVs with eight assailants quickly boxed in the agents.
Mexican investigators are operating under the theory that the Zetas wanted to carjack the Suburban or believed it was being driven by rivals from the Gulf cartel - although it is still possible that the two men were targeted because they were American agents.
While reluctant to criticize fellow officers, senior law enforcement agents stressed that in an ambush, you never stop. 
"You get off the X," they explained, meaning out of the kill zone. 
That is what an armored vehicle is designed to do. With reenforced "ram bumpers," heavy-duty shocks and "run-flat" tires, the vehicles are not only secure shells but weapons.
With the Suburban on the side of the road and unlocked, the Zeta gunmen wrestled Avila's passenger door open. 
As the agents screamed that they were Americans and diplomats, Avila or his attackers hit the button that rolled down the bulletproof window. 
The gap was just four inches but enough for one gunman to get the barrel of his AK-47 into the Suburban and rake gunfire across their laps. 
"Avila described them as in a frenzy, as pure evil," said McCaul, the Texas congressman.  Avila was hit twice, in the thigh and ankle, and grazed by two other shots, but he managed to close the window and secure the door. Zapata took six bullets. One severed his femoral artery. 
As Zapata bled to death in the driver's seat and Avila placed a frantic call for help to the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City, the gunmen pumped 90 more rounds into the Suburban. None penetrated its armor. 
The Suburban driven by Zapata was outfitted by Arlington-based BAE Systems, a U.S. subsidiary of the British defense contractor, maker of tanks, submarines and jet fighters. 
Disabling the unlocking mechanism on a Suburban is a relatively simple process, armoring specialists say. The setting can be adjusted on the vehicle computer by the driver or permanently altered in favor of a manual system.
U.S. officials say all of the vehicles in Mexico were reprogrammed to address the flaw after Zapata's death. But armoring contractors point out that if the computer on the Suburban is reset - by a power failure or a battery replacement - it will revert to the default setting, leaving the vehicle vulnerable again.
BAE Systems spokesman Brian Roehrkasse said in a statement, "The government customer was aware of the importance of disengaging the auto unlock feature." 

A gun from Texas
U.S. investigators recovered one of the military-style semiautomatic weapons used in the attack that killed Zapata.
The gun came from Texas.
Ballistic testing of spent shell casings and the raising of an obliterated serial number revealed that the weapon was a popular Romanian-made AK-47 knockoff purchased at J&J's Pawn Shop in Beaumont, smuggled south to the Zetas by a methamphetamine trafficker named ManuelGomez Barba, a U.S. citizen.
A congressional inquiry is underway to determine whether the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives allowed the weapon to "walk" across the border, just as the agency lost track of thousands of other firearms that were smuggled to Mexico through the disgraced operation known as Fast and Furious.
U.S. diplomats said American agents in Mexico follow the law, which forbids them to carry weapons. But several government sources with knowledge of the ongoing investigation say Zapata and Avila were armed on the day of the ambush, although they were outgunned. 
The sources spoke on the condition of anonymity because the issue is politically explosive in Mexico, where foreigners are prohibited from carrying firearms.
"Our guys have the ability to defend themselves," one U.S. official said. 
Capitol Hill lawmakers say they will press the State Department to force the issue with their Mexican counterparts. "We know they have their own laws," said Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Tex.). "But on the practical side, the Mexicans need to understand that we can't let this happen again. We can't leave our guys helpless." 

A frustrated family
In the weeks after the Zapata killing, thousands of U.S. agents and local police arrested and interrogated hundreds of suspected associates of Mexican drug cartels across the United States.
In Mexico, acting on U.S. intelligence from confidential informants and wiretaps, the Mexican military rounded up murder suspects and their bosses.
In December, Mexican authorities extradited an alleged low-ranking soldier in the Zeta cartel to the United States to stand trial for Zapata's death in Washington. Julian Zapata (no relation) has pleaded not guilty.
Jaime Zapata grew up in a family with a tradition of serving in U.S. law enforcement. Two of his brothers are ICE agents. But the Zapata family has grown "extremely frustrated," said Trey Martinez, their attorney.
"They want to know why he was put on that road. What equipment was so important that he had to drive up and bring it down? If it was so dangerous, why didn't they have an escort? Or fly?" 
And why, he said, hadn't anyone checked the settings on the Suburban's door locks?
"The government has been good about providing the family with emotional support," Martinez said. "But the same people that are helping them aren't giving them the answers they're looking for."

When it all goes wrong, remember that this, too, shall pass

BYLINE: Carolyn Hax

SECTION: STYLE; Pg. C03

LENGTH: 530 words

Adapted from a recent online discussion.
Dear Carolyn:
Any advice on how to keep bouncing back when life keeps sending bad news your way? I feel like that ambush scene in "Bonnie and Clyde," when the cops keep shooting long after Bonnie and Clyde have probably died. 
My father died of ALS in July; my mother has ovarian cancer and her chemotherapy isn't working; our dog is 15 and on his last legs (no pun intended); my freelance business is in the tank due to the recession. I'm talking with a therapist each week but still feel swallowed up by the never-ending crap tsunami. Advice? Other than getting a bulk discount on Kleenex? 
Resiliency
Crap tsunami, well said. It offers an answer, too: What can you do except scramble to the safest possible place and wait it out? 
Since sewage isn't actually lapping at your foundation (at least, not yet!), you can get a little more creative in the way you define "safest possible place." I can't say this enough: Strip your life of everything that either doesn't matter or can wait for later. Spare from the ax one or two activities that have a renewing effect on you, and make them your refuge. Spend your remaining energy on giving and receiving love from those whose time is running out. 
Also, take faultless care of yourself, based on the holistic trinity of sleep, exercise and healthy diet.
For your emotional state during this time, I offer two of the most enduringly useful pieces of advice I've gotten from people during my worst times: 
1. Find a steeple to chase - i.e., use a fixed point in the distance as the thing that keeps you from losing yourself and keeps you moving toward a goal. It can just be, "Take great care of my mom," or, "Stay close to my spouse/partner/best friend," or, "Make it to my annual beach week."
2. Know that everything external eventually passes. That includes bad times, good times, bulls, bears and every one of us. 
In other words, steady yourself, then trust and live by the laws of change. 
To Tsunami:
Volunteer. Do something you have always wanted to do to help those in worse shape than you. This is what I did when I was laid off with one day's notice while in radiation treatment for breast cancer. I got myself down to the local animal shelter, and it saved my sanity. I even found out that I, a cat person, really like dogs, too.
Anonymous
A great suggestion if it doesn't create time pressure that becomes another source of stress.
Since part of the tsunami is the ailing mother, caring for her can have the same benefit as giving charitably - it's still getting out of your own head, and doing something tangibly good, which are the two main benefits of volunteering.
Volunteering is also a suggestion that will keep. When this awful phase is behind Tsunami, and his or her emphasis shifts from enduring to healing, an investment in a meaningful cause can put grief to good use. Through advocacy groups (the ALS Association is close to my heart), animal welfare work or small-business support, today's bad news can be tomorrow's purpose - a kind of life after death.

JOSEPHINE TONIGHT
At MetroStage through March 18
Even while applauding the veteran team behind this undeniably entertaining new musical based on the early life of Josephine Baker, one can't help coming away from the show with a stubborn sense that something is off. "Josephine Tonight" feels small in ways that have little to do with MetroStage's intimate space. In fact, director-choreographer Maurice Hines has filled the stage with crackling dance numbers and sharp acting by the four highly seasoned pros in the cast of five. The rag-and-blues-inspired tunes were composed by the late Wally Harper, best known as singer Barbara Cook's longtime musical director and accompanist (he died in 2004). The lyrics and script are by Sherman Yellen, a Tony nominee for the book of the 1970 musical "The Rothschilds." Harper and Yellen's ragtime- and blues-inspired songs often sparkle with wit, melodiousness and infectious rhythm. But there are simply too many songs, especially in the very top-heavy Act 1. More important, though, is the lack of depth and grit in the performance of singer/dancer/actress Zurin Villanueva as Josephine Baker. Villanueva needs to be the molten core of the show and she isn't -  not yet.

LES JUSTES
At Artisphere through March 11
In WSC Avant Bard's bright, fast production of Albert Camus's "Les Justes (The Just Ones)," the characters gather and debate on a tight, elevated white platform, with the audience in Arlington's intimate Artisphere surrounding the stage. David C. Ghatan's set and lights display the drama as gleamingly as the Hope Diamond. It's a precious setting for the blood-and-guts terrorist philosophizing of Camus's 1949 play, which follows a band of conspirators as they carry out a political assassination. But then, what can you do with Camus? The script, translated and adapted by local actor-director-writer Rahaleh Nassri, is full of idealistic speeches that quickly blow cold onstage. Terror, Justice and Love are discussed like classroom abstractions, amounting to a 90-minute parade of principles that rapidly begs to be roughed up. The sheer physical energy feels like a stab at pumping up the lofty manner of the play, which is more interested in articulating ideas than in dramatizing them. Only John Stange's Stepan, the figure who argues that even children should not be spared in the pure and necessarily violent crusade for revolutionary change, conveys an urgency that's truly persuasive.

gP.NOKIO
At Imagination Stage through March 11
If you gave "The Phantom Tollbooth" some footlights and a contract with Def Jam Recordings (with a G-rating requirement), you might end up with entertainment as inspired and quirky as "P.Nokio: A Hip-Hop Musical." Sure, the latest Imagination Stage world premiere riffs on the so-well-known-it-has-been-Disneyfied story of Pinocchio. But playwright Psalmayene 24 doesn't settle for a bland rehash. As he demonstrated with "Zomo the Rabbit," which Imagination Stage premiered in 2009, Psalmayene 24 has a flair for folding fairy-tale wonder into an infectious hip-hop vibe. As the director of "P.Nokio," as well as its writer and star, he repeats the trick, teleporting us to the realm of Hip-Hopia, where people pay bills in street credits and boomboxes can be the size of city blocks. One of Hip-Hopia's residents is G.Petto (James J. Johnson), a computer game designer who creates a screen-transcending animated child named P.Nokio. Sent off to attend the Old School, P.Nokio willfully wanders past a Fork in the road into the Forest of Fraudulent Fun, where he is bamboozled by con artists Fox Madoff (Jacob Yeh) and Cat Burgler (Carkuff). But all ends happily, thanks to the intervention of the spray-painting Graffiti Fairy (Paige Hernandez) and, more important, P.Nokio's real love for G.Petto.

gREALLY REALLY
At Signature Theatre through March 25
This may be the first time you're hearing of Paul Downs Colaizzo, but on the evidence of his crackling new play, the name bears committing to memory. A sexually charged comedy-drama about self-serving collegians of a coldly calculating variety, "Really Really" sucks you in with its brio and caustic wit and holds you with its teasingly clever double-edged plot. As shepherded by Signature's artistic second-in-command, Matthew Gardiner, who hereby submits his credentials for entry to the first-class cabin of Washington directors, "Really Really" is the sharpest original play the Arlington company has offered up in years. The 26-year-old Colaizzo wags a scandalized finger at his own generation in "Really Really" and cries shame. Colaizzo's young people - all students, save one, at some American university or other specializing in course work and material comfort - practice what Colaizzo sees as the sorry single-minded preoccupation of the age: looking out ruthlessly for No. 1.

THE WINGS OF IKARUS JACKSON
At the Kennedy Center Family Theater through Sunday
"The Wings of Ikarus Jackson" feels light, slow and underwritten. Admittedly, director-choreographer Devanand Janki and playwright Jerome Hairston are aiming for a poetic and nuanced tone with their collaboration, an adaptation of Christopher Myers's book "Wings." The production does offer some narrative: the tale of a budding friendship between a lonely girl named Cris (Lynette Rathnam) and Ikarus (Andreu Honeycutt), who's so embarrassed by the feathered pinions sprouting from his back that he hides them inside a backpack. But the show is also an evocation of urban life, spotlighting the contrasting physicality of city-dwellers - a high-stepping power walker (S. Lewis Feemster), a hopscotch-playing girl (a dynamic Felicia Curry), a crotchety old lady (Neville Braithwaite) and others - in an orange-toned cubist metropolis (Meghan Raham designed the set and costumes). The storytelling sometimes drags, but there's piquancy in the movement, which includes a fight waged through hip-hop dance, a taxi ride chronicled with swaying bodies and a dream sequence in which schoolchildren move in seemingly weightless slow-mo after their teacher lectures on gravity.

ALMOST, MAINE
At 1st Stage through Feb. 26
The whimsy is laid on with a trowel in "Almost, Maine," John Cariani's evening of interlocking playlets about the travails and magic of young love. A talented young cast backed by an inventive design team has sporadic success cutting through the emotional peanut butter that is the script. Director Michael Chamberlin and his actors might have done better to work a little against the play's grain, instead of approaching it with so much wide-eyed wonder. The opening scene sets the tone: Two love-besotted young people (Jessica Shearer and Elliott Kashner) cavort in the snow in slow motion, then remark upon the stars. In the next scene, a hiker (Megan Dominy) arrives at an old farm house intending to camp nearby and view the Northern Lights. The homeowner (Jonathan Lee Taylor) falls instantly in love with her and plants a surprising kiss on her lips. It all gets to be a bit much pretty fast. The surfeit of cuteness aside, there are a few lovely moments in "Almost, Maine" that allow the cast to shine and director Chamberlin to show a certain nimbleness with a cloying script.

BLOOD WEDDING
At Source through March 4
Ah, the high ceremony and doom of Federico Garcia Lorca's "Blood Wedding": you can hear it in the opening notes of Mariano Vales's original music for Constellation Theatre's new production. Behzad Habibzai plucks his flamenco guitar and you sit up straight, as if you've just heard a rattlesnake's warning. It turns out to be a false alarm, for this "Blood Wedding" slacks off almost as soon as it begins. Lorca's 1933 tragedy chronicles irresistible passion and a deep family feud, and it does so in a high poetic style that eludes much of this show. The characters are archetypes: the severe Mother, the handsome Groom, the furtive young Bride, etc. Only Leonardo, the hot-tempered rival for the Groom's fiance, has a name. The fable is a sequence of small moments and grand gestures, but the size and suddenness of Lorca's style hasn't really been mastered by director Shirley Serotsky and her cast.

ELECTILE DYSFUNCTION: THE KINSEY SICKS FOR PRESIDENT! (BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT'S HARD BEING A REPUBLICAN)
At Theater J through Sunday
Can dragapella save a presidential campaign that suddenly seems to be hitting the skids, entertainment-wise? The Kinsey Sicks hope so. The Sicks are four men in red-white-and-blue drag, a "beautyshop" quartet singing a cappella parodies. Their new show at Theater J, "Electile Dysfunction: The Kinsey Sicks for President!," is a mock political rally pushing the red-meat buttons of the right as this frisky foursome tries to become the first corporation to win the White House. It's a show in which Mitt Romney is gleefully referred to as Mitzi. So what's not to like? The non-singing bits, as it turns out. The songs are marvels: They're pun-filled and sung in four-part harmony - a capella, let's remember - with a good deal of wit in the arrangements. Picture lanky Irwin Keller as Winnie, dolled up in a conservative skirt and cat's-eye glasses and singing the deep "oompah oompah" bass lines in the harmonies. When Keller's Winnie lets loose in soulful solos, it's a hoot.

ELEPHANT ROOM
At Arena Stage through Feb. 26
The Kogod Cradle, Arena Stage's architecturally high-toned third stage, may not have been the ideal host for "Elephant Room," a tacky bit of absurdist illusioneering, informed by the ambience of strip-mall cocktail lounges and landscapes featured on motel room walls. No, "Elephant Room," written and performed by Steve Cuiffo, Geoff Sobelle and Trey Lyford, would look far more comfortable in some ramshackle, claustrophobic space, where its raw aesthetics and ironic sensibility might not pose the glaring counterpoint that it does to refined surroundings.As it is, the 70-minute show, directed by Paul Lazar, comes across as a thin - and occasionally downright sloppy - riff on the sorry state of that quaint staple of birthday parties and down-market casinos, the professional magician. Relying on the good will of audience members (a couple of whom are brought into the antics) the show gives the appearance of being more sincere than, say, something caustically whipped up by the put-on jokester Sacha Baron Cohen of "Borat" fame.

THE GALLERIST
At Atlas Performing Arts Center through Sunday
So, was the comely Selena Featherstone possessed by a pygmy capuchin monkey named Iago? Not the sort of question one wrestles with on a typical night out. But then "The Gallerist" strives mightily to avoid any contact with the typical. A fusion of gothic horror, Freudian intrigue and lesbian romance, Fengar Gael's drama, in a world premiere by Rorschach Theatre, is tantalizingly oddball, though it would seem to require a more effervescent treatment than director Catherine Tripp's often muted approach allows. Selena's modern-day descendant, the seriously creepy Bertram Plover, narrates the story of Selena from a New York jail cell. A century earlier in London, Selena's mother beseeches Selena's cousin Laura to allow Selena to live with her after Selena massacres a roomful of her family's pet birds. Laura, an artist who's ditched by her snooty art-critic boyfriend after he decides she's talentless, takes Selena in and begins to paint the birds Selena describes from memory - paintings that will end up in Plover's hands 100 years on. Louise Schlegel and Blair Bowers have by far the most demanding roles, made trickier by the scenes in which Selena, in "Exorcist" style, must seem to spew Iago's verbal bile. They both hold their own in a promising piece that manages to go out on a limb and yet still feels as if it could be allowed to venture out a little bit further.

gTHE GAMING TABLE
At Folger Theatre through March 4
With a buoyant air and a bouquet of ripe performances, Folger Theatre further expands Washington's classical borders with "The Gaming Table," a sendup of 18th-century social probity by the Restoration-comedy playwright Susanna Centlivre.
Name doesn't ring a bell? Nope, not with me, either. That's partly why this piquant dish, mounted with considerable aplomb by director Eleanor Holdridge - and dressed to the sensational nines by costume designer Jessica Ford - comes with a side of pleasant discovery. Centlivre, whom history records as a feisty, self-reliant sort (How, really, could she not have been?), was one of the few women writing popular plays in England at the turn of the 18th century, when comic dramatists such as William Congreve ("The Way of the World") were in vogue. Refreshingly in "The Gaming Table," it's the women who, by and large, dictate romantic terms. They're ladies who know what they want and only reluctantly yield to the entreaties of husbands and suitors.

gLAUGHTER ON THE 23RD FLOOR
At Church Street Theater through Saturday
So seven guys and a gal walk into a dumpy office in Manhattan, dip into the coffee, bagels and Danish, and start crackin' wise. They write sketches for a hit 1950s TV show starring someone very much like Sid Caesar, but who's called Max Prince. Their raucous yet intimate staging is, with few minor exceptions, well cast and performed with the kind of clockwork timing that a Neil Simon script requires. Our guide through the chaos is Lucas, presumably based on the young playwright, a wannabe writer hired by Prince on a trial basis. We meet the other writers as they amble, saunter or shlump into work. Angst burbles between the laughs in Simon's play. Who knew that Keegan Theatre, a company better known for staging Irish and American melodramas, and more recently musicals, could dive into Neil Simon at his shtickiest and come up trumps?

NECESSARY SACRIFICES
At Ford's Theatre through Saturday
At Ford's Theatre Museum, decorous glass-cased displays and solemn recorded voices chronicle the presidency of Abraham Lincoln. Whiffs of the exhibits' earnest, tidily instructive aura also cling to "Necessary Sacrifices," the drama about Lincoln and Frederick Douglass that's onstage one floor up from the museum. Recalling two documented meetings between the president and the abolitionist in 1863 and 1864, Richard Hellesen's idea-packed drama is so carefully informative and so neatly packaged that you exit feeling as if you've racked up an AP History credit, rather than experienced a piece of art. That's not to say that "Necessary Sacrifices," commissioned by Ford's and directed by Jennifer L. Nelson, lacks engaging or affecting moments. The author of three other historical plays produced by Ford's - "One Destiny," "The Road From Appomattox" and the walking tour "Investigation: Detective McDevitt" - Hellesen has seeded this research-based script with colorful Civil War details and anchored it to a lively, often humorous portrait of the president. Fleshing out the portrait is David Selby, an actor who's an old pro at this particular game, having depicted Honest Abe in Ford's "The Heavens Are Hung in Black," as well as in "Lincoln and James," which Selby wrote himself.

gNEXT FALL
At Round House Theatre through Feb. 26
The emotional stakes are high in Geoffrey Nauffts's "Next Fall," an intimate tragicomedy about love, faith and death. Thanks to a gifted cast and a sensitive director in Mark Ramont, the emotional rewards are high for audiences, as well. This is not to say that the Tony-nominated play and Round House's new production unfold flawlessly. Yet the figurative punch in the sternum that theater lovers long for happens at this show in spades. And that's saying something. The play opens with all the characters save one gathering in a care unit of a New York hospital. Luke, a rising young stage actor, has had an accident and lies in a coma. In the waiting room we meet his friend Holly (Dawn Ursula), a new-age-type candle shop owner; his friend and perhaps onetime lover, the uptight Brandon (Alexander Strain); and his voluble, up-from-trailer-trash mother, Arlene (Kathryn Kelley), long divorced from but still squabbling with Butch (Kevin Cutts), his Christian fundamentalist father. Dashing in from the airport is Adam (Tom Story), Luke's lover of four years. Nauffts tells the story of Adam and Luke's relationship in flashbacks. Yet this is a match most certainly not made in heaven.

gRED
At Arena Stage through March 11
For all its highfalutin discourse, the most engrossing moment of Arena Stage's immensely enjoyable "Red" comes when the two actors dip their brushes into buckets and paint. The activity in which the superbly matched Edward Gero and Patrick Andrews engage, in point of fact, is priming a canvas half again as tall as the two of them. The pleasure of the interlude is in the way it conveys the full, symbiotic immersion of the characters: Gero's Mark Rothko, the vain, abrasive creator of all those mesmerizing canvases of migrating mood and undulating color, and Andrews's Ken, a composite of the assistants who toiled in Rothko's Manhattan studio. Rothko acknowledges anxiety over the pop-art movement that is supplanting abstract expressionism. Ken pricks Rothko's conscience. Both the painter and his assistant know from pain; it's as certain an ingredient in their work as the pigments they mix. Maybe that helps explain why Rothko and his young employee find in the act of priming a canvas a cathartic common pursuit. They don't simply aim to prime that canvas. They want to unleash the Furies on it.

gTIME STANDS STILL
At Studio Theatre through Sunday
Why is it that a loving relationship is more apt to withstand bombs than the dormant aftermath? Playwright Donald Margulies poses this question in the steadily engrossing drama performed with the polish of a splendidly synchronized string quartet. The four actors at director Susan Fenichell's keenly realized command apply a completely convincing varnish to the framework of Margulies's story about two journalists returning from harrowing stints in Iraq. James has come home with shattered nerves: The nomadic life of a war correspondent has lost its romance for him. Sarah, a widely admired war photographer, returns gravely injured after a roadside bombing. But she is not, apparently, cured of the job's adrenaline rush. Therein lies the central tension. The play dances on the edge of James's and Sarah's bottled anger, especially as they're forced to confront the warmer, cozier love between their magazine editor and his new, dewy girlfriend. The evening's solid state reaffirms a perception that what Studio puts on its stages these days is all aspiring - and often coming close to - a gold standard.

THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA
At Lansburgh Theatre through March 4
The Shakespeare Theatre Company's entertaining but over-the-top "The Two Gentlemen of Verona" wastes no time coming at you. PJ Paparelli's production of Shakespeare's comedy about double-crossing friends opens in a fast-food parking lot with teenagers engaging in binge drinking. Yes, it's a comedy: The play has two clowns and a dog, and the lovers and friends spend a lot of time swapping witty repartee. But the emotional switchbacks are sharp, and the play's sudden ending threatens real violence. If the show doesn't quite click, it's largely because of its cineplex-style use of U2 tunes and firearms. Music is oxygen in this milieu, of course, but some of the songs are so painfully on the nose as to be eye-rolling. There are "Glee"-spirited moments that will make you laugh, but that's offset by the sense of applying an easy pop patch where the characters or story seem reluctant to fly. But the big test of how you feel about this lively "Two Gents" is how you respond to its violence. Some of the chase scenes and scuffles are fabulous, but this weaponized show repeatedly pushes its kids to extreme moments of despair and self-damage with razors and pistols, making this play darker and more disturbing. In his last plays, Shakespeare used magic and an expansive spirit to make us accept crazy tales. For the rougher "Two Gents," Paparelli gets it done at gunpoint.

Forging ahead despite a haunting past

Young Christopher Singleton needed a ride to speech therapy class. His mother had the flu, so she asked her estranged husband for a favor.
Singleton's father, Lawrence Davis, drove to the house, sat his 6-year-old son in the blue Oldsmobile and dashed back inside. Christopher heard screams: "Somebody help me!" Then Davis came downstairs and drove his son to class.
Elizabeth Patrice Singleton was found dead that day, March 1, 1999, curled up on the floor of her apartment. She was stabbed 11 times in her torso, an autopsy found.
Christopher told authorities what he remembered, but the investigation stalled. Police were reluctant to accuse Davis based on a child's testimony, family members and authorities say. The lead detective and prosecutor left their jobs, DNA test results gathered dust and the search for witnesses languished. 
Nobody was charged for years. Authorities now admit mistakes with the investigation they call an unusual and extreme breakdown.
Sometimes justice is delayed. In this case, it took more than a decade. In November, a  jury found Davis, 47, guilty of first-degree murder in his wife's death. He is scheduled to  be sentenced Friday and could spend the rest of his life in prison.
Christopher, meanwhile, is forging ahead. "I couldn't let this stop me from living my life," he says. Physically unharmed during his mother's killing, he was nevertheless indelibly shaped by it.
He is now a tall, thin man of 19. He rarely thinks about his father, whom he saw for the first time since he was 6 during the murder trial.
He is reserved and wary. The letters "F.O.E." - for "Family Over Everything" - are tattooed on his biceps. And he is a father himself: 3-year-old Crystal Elizabeth has her grandmother's brown doe eyes. They laugh at children's television together; they walk together to and from her day care.
While she is away, he fills out job applications and cleans the Columbia Heights apartment they share with her mother, his former girlfriend.
And he wrestles with his recollections. In the murder's aftermath, prosecutors urged family members not to discuss the case with Christopher, worried about weakening the boy's testimony. In the years that followed, the family rarely spoke of the killing and Christopher kept to himself.
He is still learning details of his parents' relationship and wishes things were otherwise. "Nobody wants to think their father killed their mother," he said.
There were warnings. In September 1998, Singleton told police that Davis punched her in her face and body, threatening to kill her if she reported his actions, according to court records. A day later, she obtained a court order that required him to stay at least 100 feet away for a year.
Singleton and her sons - Christopher has two brothers, Calvin, 21, and Kevin, 25 - moved from the family's Edgewood home to Southeast Washington. But Davis petitioned to see his children during their separation, allowing him to remain close, said Ivy Moorefield, Elizabeth Singleton's youngest sister.
In mid-December, a thinly dressed Singleton turned up at Eastern Senior High School, blocks from her home, on a wintry afternoon, according to court records and trial testimony. She told school officials that Davis had held her hostage with a gun for a week, raping her repeatedly.
He was soon arrested. But authorities dismissed a sexual assault charge against Davis the day after his arrest, according to court records, because Singleton "waited a week to report the rape and allowed [Davis] to stay in the house." Bill Miller, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's office, declined to elaborate on that decision.
As he left the courtroom after the charge was dropped, according to court documents, Davis whispered to his wife: "You broke your promise. Now it's time to die." He was charged with threatening Singleton, and a trial was set for March 24, 1999.
Singleton alleged that Davis came to her home twice more, violating the restraining order. But she didn't let him in, according to court documents, and he was not arrested in either incident.
On March 1 - with Singleton weakened by the flu, their older sons off to school and her youngest waiting in a car - Davis got inside.
Singleton may have sensed danger. Weeks before she was killed, she told family members she did not want Davis raising her sons if something happened to her, Moorefield said.
"She was scared," Moorefield said recently. "She told us he was going to kill her and get away with it because the system failed her."
It is not known whether Singleton intended to let Davis into her home that morning. There was no sign of forced entry. But "why would she fear for her life knowing her young son was only feet away sitting in the front seat of the car?" Assistant U.S. Attorney Amanda Haines  said in the November trial.
Singleton, 32, was found dead in the fetal position near a living room sofa, cold medicine and orange juice, according to court documents.
The investigation crumbled, according to Singleton's family members and individuals in law enforcement, as the file passed through three sets of detectives and prosecutors. 
It "dropped through the cracks," a law enforcement official said recently. Singleton did everything she could within the law, Haines said during the trial, but "had not received justice in her lifetime."
Police and prosecutors took the case up again only after a chance conversation between Moorefield and former homicide detective Ben Collins in 2007. Moorefield was working in technical support for the city government when Collins called for assistance, and she brought up her sister's case. 
Collins told cold case detective Jeffrey Williams about the conversation. Williams took the case to Haines and her colleague Sharon Donovan, who found a DNA report linking Davis to Singleton's dead body. The report sat in files for nearly a decade after Singleton's autopsy. The trio also unearthed a witness who said he saw Davis at Singleton's house on the morning of the murder. The witness, a neighbor, had never been questioned by police.
Davis was arrested in June 2009.
George Kucik, commander of the D.C. police's criminal investigation unit, said there were "issues that need to be checked" regarding the case. "If mistakes were made, we will make every effort to improve," Kucik said in a recent e-mail.
The wait left Christopher Singleton and his family frustrated and angry. "I don't believe in this justice system," he said recently. "They don't do what they're supposed to do. They do what they want to do."
Singleton took the stand in November in D.C. Superior Court, recalling the March morning he waited for Davis in the Oldsmobile. He avoided his father's eyes.
Haines presented the DNA evidence and the neighbor testified. Davis's attorneys argued that prosecutors charged the wrong man, and he did not testify. After three days of deliberations, the jury convicted him.
Christopher and his brothers were sent to live with an aunt in Charleston, S.C., after their mother's death. Christopher recently graduated from high school there and moved back to the District, where he is preparing to take the SAT - he plans to study business in college - and helping to raise his daughter.
"I want to make myself better for her so she can have a better life," he said.
Christopher says his mother "sent" Crystal to him, and he brightens when he talks about his daughter.
But he often remains guarded. His head is frequently bowed over a cellphone, which he uses to tweet and send text messages. Crystal's mother, 19-year-old Howard University student India Stevens, says he can be distant, isolating himself when angry and refusing to discuss his feelings. Sometimes, she says, he feels as though "the world is against him."
Singleton has changed his middle name. Once Lawrence, after his father, he now uses the name Travis, for an uncle who was shot dead in the District a decade ago. The last contact between father and son was seven years ago, when Davis wrote Christopher a letter. Christopher did not respond.
"I really don't have anything to say to him," he said.
Christopher, Calvin and Kevin all live on the same block. They are best friends, and they record rap songs together at a local studio. Each has the words "My Brother's Keeper" inked across his chest.
Christopher has two other tattoos he got when he was 15. The words "Life" and "Death" mark his wrists.

Cameron to Scots:Don't spurn U.K.
British Prime Minister David Cameron delivered an emotional plea during a visit to Edinburgh on Thursday, urging Scots to remain within the United Kingdom and vowing to offer the region more autonomy if they reject independence in an upcoming referendum.
Cameron's speech came just before key talks with Scotland's first minister and head of the Scottish National Party, AlexSalmond. The region's biggest advocate for independence, Salmond has called a referendum for fall 2014 that could end Scotland's more than 300-year-old status as part of Great Britain.  
In negotiations Thursday that Cameron called "frustrating," the two leaders failed to agree on two key issues pertaining to the vote: the wording of the independence question and whether more than one question would be presented to Scottish voters.
Cameron, meanwhile, issued a direct appeal to Scots, asking them to reject independence. "The United Kingdom isn't just some sort of deal, to be reduced to the lowest common denominator," he said. "It's a precious thing. It's about our history, our values, our shared identity and our joint place in the world."

Top court upholdspro-Correa verdict
Ecuador's highest court on Thursday upheld a criminal libel verdict favoring President Rafael Correa, sentencing three newspaper executives and a columnist to three years in prison each and ordering them to pay a total of $42 million in damages.
The defendants, joined by international press freedom and human rights groups, had called the case a cynical attempt by Correa to bankrupt the country's leading opposition newspaper,El Universo, and part of a campaign to stifle free speech.
Correa had said he had no choice but to file suit to defend himself against false accusations in a column by Emilio Palacio published a year ago in El Universo that repeatedly referred to Correa as "the Dictator."
Three of the four defendants, including Palacio, left Ecuador before the verdict.

119 freed, 1 killedin storming of prison
Attackers stormed a federal prison in Nigeria with guns and explosives late Wednesday, killing a guard and freeing 119 inmates in a fresh demonstration of the country's instability, an official said Thursday.
About 25 prisoners had been recaptured by late Thursday.
The government said an investigation had begun in Kogi state, just south of the capital, Abuja.
No group immediately asserted responsibility for the attack, and a prisons service spokesman said he did not know whether the inmates included any members of a radical Islamist sect known as Boko Haram, which staged a massive prison break in another state in 2010.
- Associated Press
Most inmates of burned Honduran prison not convicted: Most inmates of the overcrowded Honduran prison where a deadly fire broke out Tuesday night had never been charged, let alone convicted, according to an internal Honduran government report obtained by the Associated Press. The report, which was sent to the United Nations this month, said 57 percent of the about 800 inmates were either awaiting trial or being held as suspected gang members. Officials confirmed 358 dead on Thursday.
Panel says Iraq's Hashimi ran death squads: An Iraqi judicial panel said that the country's Sunni vice president, Tariq al-Hashimi, and his employees operated death squads that targeted security officials and Shiite pilgrims. The findings offer the first independent assessment of accusations that have triggered a political crisis and threaten to reignite sectarian tensions. The panel did not offer any evidence to support its conclusions, which are not legally binding.
Egyptian Islamist denounces U.S. aid threats: The leader of Egypt's largest Islamist party has rejected U.S. threats to cut aid over a spat about nonprofit groups operating in the country, saying they are out of line and could imperil the country's peace deal with Israel. The comments by Mohammed Morsi, the leader of the political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood, were carriedby the state news agency and posted on the party Facebook page.
N. Korea marks late leader's birthday: North Korea commemorated the birthday of late autocratic leader Kim Jong Il, capping weeks of celebration that included carving his name into the side of a mountain, as the country tries to burnish the legacy of the Kim dynasty. The anniversary comes two months after Kim's death and the succession of his son Kim Jong Eun as head of the impoverished state.

Md. man convicted of plot to kill witness

BYLINE: Del Quentin Wilber

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B05

LENGTH: 257 words

A 33-year-old Maryland man was found guilty Thursday of conspiring to kill a witness against him in a federal drug prosecution.  
It took a jury in the District's federal court two days to reach a verdict after the two-week trial of Weldon Gordon on charges of conspiring to obstruct justice by tampering with a witness and tampering with a witness by killing, as well as drug distribution. 
Prosecutors have said that Gordon, of Largo, directed his girlfriend to befriend the witness, Andre Hayes, 32. She then lured Hayes to a house in Upper Marlboro, where Gordon shot and killed him early on Nov. 1, 2008. At the time, Hayes was the key informant in a Drug Enforcement Administration investigation that led to federal narcotics distribution charges being filed against Gordon in the District.
The girlfriend, Tiffany Reaves, who pleaded guilty last year to tampering with a witness, testified for the prosecution at Gordon's trial, court records show. 
Gordon's attorney, Thomas J. Saunders, said he planned to appeal the verdict but declined to comment further.
Gordon is scheduled to be sentenced May 17 by U.S. District Judge Ricardo M. Urbina, who presided over the trial. 
Assistant U.S. Attorneys Darlene M. Soltys and Emory V. Cole declined to comment after the verdict. 
In June, a federal grand jury indicted Gordon's mother, Vicki, 51, and his sister, Keyla Clements, 35, and her husband, Antoine Clements, 38, on charges that they lied to grand jurors by providing a false alibi for Gordon. They have pleaded not guilty.

Budget in Virginia far from finalized

BYLINE: Laura Vozzellaand Anita Kumar

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B01

LENGTH: 893 words

DATELINE: RICHMOND

RICHMOND - After weeks ofpitched battles over guns, abortion and voting rights, the Virginia General Assembly is about to fight over something else: money.
The Senate Finance and House Appropriations committees will release their versions of the state budget Sunday after having their way with Gov. Robert F. McDonnell's two-year, $85 billion spending plan.
Along with the shift in focus comes a power shift, as Democrats see their opportunity to come roaring back in Richmond. 
The budget proposed by McDonnell (R) would move millions from public schools and health care to higher education, transportation and the underfunded state pension system. Legislators have the power to overhaul his 483-page plan. And while they don't seem inclined to go that far, they intend to do more than tweak it.
House and Senate leaders said they will increase money for K-12 education and boost funding for free health clinics, nursing homes and hospitals. They intend to restore some cuts to localities.
The tax-averse House also wants to strip McDonnell's proposed budget of $22 million in higher Department of Motor Vehicles and restaurant inspection fees and increased employer payments to the unemployment compensation trust fund.
"There will be some changes" in the budget, Sen. Charles J. Colgan (D-Prince William) said.
That's an understatement when it comes to transportation, at least in the Senate.
The House has largely endorsed McDonnell's plan to divert $110 million from the general fund, which pays for core services such as education and health care, to spend on transportation. But the Senate balked, instead proposing a plan that would raise the gas tax to reflect inflation.
"I rather suspect the governor was surprised when it was dumped on top of his transportation bill," said Sen. Mark D. Obenshain (R-Harrisonburg), who predicted the gas tax increase would not pass the House.
Democrats have been shut out of power since Republicans, who already had the House and governor's mansion, took control of the evenly divided Senate in January. The GOP could claim the majority because Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling (R) has the power to break tie votes.
But Bolling has acknowledged http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/virginia-lawmakers-vote-to-lift-handgun-purchase-limit/2012/02/06/gIQATFE0uQ_story.htmlthat he does not have authority to vote on budget matters. So Democrats, at least in the Senate, suddenly have some muscle to flex.
Republicans have warned Senate Democrats against playing politics with the budget. Senate Majority Leader Thomas K. Norment (R-James City), a member of the Finance Committee, said there is little reason for them to do so; the committee is likely to amend McDonnell's budget to make it more amenable to Democrats.
"We are putting things in the budget that they have asked for, perhaps that Republicans might not otherwise embrace," Norment said. "I would just hope they don't turn around and say, 'Our political feelings are still hurt, and therefore we're going to vote against a budget . . . to show that we're politically relevant.' "
Sens. Richard L. Saslaw (D-Fairfax) and A. Donald McEachin (D-Richmond) dashed off an angry letter to McDonnell on Thursday after the governor released one he'd sent them to ask for Democratic budget proposals.
"[Y]our release of your letter without waiting even twenty-four hours for a response smacks of gamesmanship and not of an effort to resolve our differences," they wrote.
Even if Senate Republicans and Democrats can find common ground, they'll have to reconcile their budget with the one that comes out of the more conservative House before the General Assembly adjourns March 10.
But right now, the chambers are focused on fleshing out their separate plans.
House Majority Leader M. Kirkland Cox (R-Colonial Heights) said the House plan will include fewer tax credits than McDonnell recommended.
On health care, House and Senate budget writers are looking to restore some cuts. McDonnell made his deepest cuts in Medicaid, saving $259 million by not adjusting hospital payments for inflation. He also sought to cut health-care safety net providers by 50 percent in the second year of the budget - a total of $4.8 million from free clinics, community health centers and the Virginia Health Care Foundation.
"I think they're very concerned about health care,'' said Katharine Webb, senior vice president at the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association. "I'm hopeful and optimistic the case has been made.''
McDonnell proposed an increase of $438 million for K-12 education. But $342 million of that would go to replenish the teacher retirement system. He also recommended withholding inflation adjustments for any non-teaching expenses.
Lawmakers said they plan larger increases in K-12 funding, with the House pegging its figure at $140 million and the Senate not disclosing how much it would add.
Both chambers support McDonnell's proposal to spend $230 million on colleges and universities. But House Republicans say they will reduce some of the money McDonnell allocated for research and development.
McDonnell has proposed pumping a record $2.2 billion into the state retirement system for state and local employees over the next two years. 
House and Senate leaders support that but object to some changes he has made for retiree benefits.

To sleep, perchance to scream

BYLINE: Jeff Turrentine

SECTION: STYLE; Pg. C03

LENGTH: 804 words

Ghosts have long served an important role in our literature - not only as terrifiers, the role they're probably most comfortable playing, but also as fuddy-duddy moralizers (think "A Christmas Carol"); Victorian-era stand-ins for repressed sexual abuse ("The Turn of the Screw"); or inducers of guilt (Macbeth's Banquo). They're as abundant in the horror genre, obviously, as creaky old attics and full moons. But writers of literary fiction usually feel compelled to tread lightly in the graveyard. For all their spookiness, ghosts can be something of a cheap fix: spectral shorthand for the idea that a character is "haunted" by some weighty matter left unresolved.  
Ghosts are everywhere, though, in "Stay Awake," the powerful and disturbing new collection of short stories by Dan Chaon. This is horror fiction, but of an entirely different sort from what we're accustomed to. The menacing spirits in these dozen tales don't rattle chains or send teacups flying. They do, however, live up to the title of "apparition," in that they're likely to appear suddenly and without warning, and to send hearts racing. They emerge unbidden from the characters' troubled pasts: They are the shades of missing children, parents and lovers whose absence is felt - keenly and often frighteningly - as a chilling presence.
The book's title is more than a reference to a favorite lullaby: It's a warning. Bad things happen to the folks who fall asleep in Chaon's lean, terse stories, which can evoke Raymond Carver in their ability to wreak strange poetry from plain-spoken language, and Sherwood Anderson, the author's fellow Ohioan, in their sympathy for the lonely and the left behind. These characters close their eyes and crash their cars; or their houses burn down with family members trapped inside; or their mentally disturbed fathers reach the ends of their tattered emotional ropes, which are tied to the handles of guns. And that's just what happens to them when they literally fall asleep. As victims of trauma, they're living in a kind of half-sleep, caught between the sad, groggy lives they lead and the happy, productive lives they had perhaps imagined for themselves before tragedy struck.
It's enough to drive some of them mad, and it does. "It was as if he were a long-dormant radio that had begun to receive signals - tuned in, abruptly, to all the crazy note-writers of the world," Chaon writes about one of these forlorn souls in "To Psychic Underworld: ." He's an underemployed electrician and widower whose crippling grief is beginning to look a lot like the onset of schizophrenia. Lately, messages have been appearing everywhere: in discarded notes on the ground, inserted between the pages of waiting-room magazines, in the scritch-scratched tracks made by pigeon feet. They're pushing him toward a startling realization about himself: "You are still you, but changing fast."
He's in only slightly better shape than the solitary young man in "Patrick Lane, Flabbergasted," who might very well be slipping into psychosis as he trudges back and forth from the grocery store, where he stocks shelves, to his childhood home - the site of his parents' joint suicide and the site, too, of the prison cell he has constructed for himself from everyday items: his TV, his PlayStation console, his computer, his dresser. They're all "cluttered in a kind of fort around the sofa bed. He hadn't been upstairs to his bedroom in probably a long time." In his loneliness and dull despair he, too, is beginning to sense a dark force, "something large and omnipotent hovering over not just himself and his house" but over the entire planet.
Throughout "Stay Awake," the motifs pile up like automobiles in a 20-car pileup. Horrible vehicular accidents are so plentiful that when one character says his friend didn't die in a car crash, Chaon seems to be indulging an extraordinarily dark, dry sense of humor. But the most harrowing image - the one that the writer obviously can't shake, the demon image that he seems desperate to exorcise - is that of a hard-to-make-out face, leaning in over your bed as you sleep and waking you up. It could be the face of a parent, loving or menacing. It could be the face of a child you abandoned years earlier, or the emergency-room nurse on whose mercies your life suddenly depends. 
Or it could be the face of a missing lover. Chaon's wife, the writer Sheila Schwartz, died in 2008 from cancer, and there doesn't seem to be much doubt that the shock of her death is still working its way out of his system and into his writing. The shocks in this collection are many, and they're as frightening and reverberant as the shock of seeing a ghostly face in your bedroom at night.

Small plane enters presidential airspace
Two Air Force F-16 fighter jets intercepted a privately owned Cessna plane that entered the same Los Angeles airspace as Marine One, the helicopter that was ferrying President Obama on Thursday. A law enforcement official said police discovered about 40 pounds of marijuana in the plane after it landed at Long Beach Airport. 
The Secret Service said the president was never in danger.
In a statement, the North American Aerospace Defense Command said it scrambled two F-16s from March Air Reserve Base in Riverside County to intercept a Cessna over Los Angeles about 2:30 p.m. Eastern time.
The Secret Service said the plane had entered the same airspace as Marine One. Officials interviewed the pilot and turned the matter over to local law enforcement.

Figure in '89 killingsis accused of lying
A former Salvadoran military officer accused of colluding in the 1989 slayings of six Jesuit priests pleaded not guilty Thursday in Boston to charges of fraud and perjury for allegedly lying on U.S. immigration forms.
Inocente Orlando Montano, 69, has lived near Boston for about a decade. He was among 20 Salvadorans indicted in Spain last year in connection with the slayings during El Salvador's 12-year civil war.
Prosecutors allege that Montano made false statements when he applied for temporary protected status in 2002. Montano allegedly answered "no" to questions about whether he had ever served in a military unit.

Man charged with attempt to bombU.S. Capitol

BYLINE: Sari Horwitz;William Wan and;Del Quentin Wilber

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A01

LENGTH: 1311 words

Federal authorities on Friday arrested a 29-year-old Moroccan man in an alleged plot to carry out a suicide bombing at the U.S. Capitol, the latest in a series of terrorism-related arrests resulting from undercover sting operations.
For more than a year, Amine El Khalifi, of Alexandria, considered attacking targets including a synagogue, an Alexandria building with military offices and a Washington restaurant frequented by military officials, authorities said. When arrested a few blocks from the Capitol around lunchtime on Friday, he was carrying what he believed to be a loaded automatic weapon and a suicide vest ready for detonation.
The gun and vest were provided not by al-Qaeda, as Khalifi had been told, but by undercover FBI agents who rendered them inoperable, authorities said.
They said Khalifi had been the subject of a lengthy investigation and never posed a threat to the public. On Friday afternoon, he made an initial court appearance in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, where he was charged with attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction against federal property. He faces life in prison if convicted. 
Khalifi "allegedly believed he was working with al-Qaeda," said Neil H. MacBride, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. Khalifi "devised the plot, the targets and the methods on his own."
In several recent terrorism sting operations, critics have accused federal investigators of provoking suspects and, in some cases, suggesting possible targets or tactics. Legal experts say the FBI sometimes walks a fine line in such cases.
"You want to be very sure that the narrative is not substantially provided by the government," said Karen Greenberg, director of the Center on National Security at Fordham Law School, who studies terrorism sting operations. "There's a lot of gray area in these cases."
But officials said Friday that Khalifi, who allegedly conducted surveillance on the Capitol and engaged in methodical planning, was no unwitting victim.
Khalifi arrived in the United States when he was 16 and was living as an illegal immigrant in Northern Virginia, having overstayed his visitor's visa for years, officials said. In 2010, he was evicted from an Arlington apartment after having failed to pay rent.
The landlord of that apartment, Frank Dynda, a retired patent lawyer, said, "He was getting mysterious packages labeled 'books,' but I didn't think there were books in them."
Dynda said he thought Khalifi was "suspicious and hostile," and Dynda reported Khalifi to Arlington police. Two officers visited Dynda's apartment building soon after the report but told him there was no reason to pursue the matter, he said.
It was unclear how Khalifi came to the attention of federal authorities. According tothe criminal complaint filed in court Friday, a confidential source reported to the FBI in January 2011 that Khalifi had met at a residence in Arlington with individuals, one of whom produced what appeared to be an AK-47 assault rifle, two revolvers and ammunition.
When one of the other individuals expressed the sentiment that "the 'war on terrorism' was a 'war on Muslims' and said that the group needed to be ready for war," Khalifi reportedly agreed, according to the complaint.
Khalifi "sought to be associated with an armed extremist group" and was introduced on Dec. 1, 2011, to a man called Yusuf, who was an undercover law enforcement officer.
According to the criminal complaint, during meetings with the undercover officer, Khalifi indicated his desire to conduct an operation in which he could carry out a shooting rampage in a restaurant. That restaurant - like the synagogue - was not identified in court documents.
On Jan. 15, Khalifi told undercover agents that he had modified his plans for the attack and wanted to conduct a suicide bombing at the Capitol, according to the complaint. It said that on that same day, at a quarry in West Virginia, Khalifi carried out a test bombing using a cellphone as a detonation device; the test bomb exploded, and Khalifi expressed a desire for a larger explosion in his attack.
On Friday, before preparing for what he allegedly considered a "martyrdom" mission, Khalifi prayed at Dar Al-Hijrah, a Northern Virginia mosque, according to its imam, Johari Abdul-Malik, who said he learned of Khalifi's presence in an afternoon phone call from the FBI. "They said that the guy prayed at the mosque this morning," Abdul-Malik said. "They said they've been following him for a long time now, and he's not a regular attender at our mosque nor any other mosque."
Khalifi was driven into downtown Washington by Yusuf and another man who was working undercover with the FBI. Afterward, Khalifi began walking alone toward the Capitol but quickly was arrested, authorities said.
"There is no doubt that this guy was committed," said a law enforcement official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the investigation.
Following the arrest, FBI agents and Arlington police raided a red-brick rambler on Randolph Street in the Douglas Park neighborhood, near a wooded area with trails and a creek. Agents were seen going in and out of the house and searching the back yard. Arlington police said they were assisting with a search warrant.
As news of the arrest spread, several members of the mosque Khalifi visited expressed concern that they could be thrust into the spotlight once again, even though Khalifi was not thought to have been a regular worshiper at the mosque.
Dar Al-Hijrah has weathered repeated criticism for ties to worshipers who were found to have been terrorism suspects. The mosque's leaders have noted that, as one of the largest mosques in the Mid-Atlantic, it attracts worshipers from all over, including many who attend infrequently.
In the past year, federal agents have arrested at least 20 people in the United States on terrorism-related charges, according to the Senate Intelligence Committee. Washington has been the alleged target in at least two terrorism cases. In one, a Massachusetts man of Bangladeshi descent was arrested for allegedly plotting to fly explosives-packed model planes into the Pentagon and the Capitol. In the other, Farooque Ahmed, a Pakistani American from Ashburn, attempted to bomb Washington area Metro stations. In both of those cases, the FBI relied on undercover agents.
Ashraf Nubani, a Muslim lawyer in Washington who has defended terrorism suspects in similar cases in the past, said he has has watched with alarm the increase of such FBI stings.
"It's controlled from beginning to end by FBI. But you can't create a terrorism case and then say you stopped it," Nubani said. "Had the FBI not been involved, through their manipulation or informants, would the same thing have happened? Would there be attempted violence? They have their sights on certain people, the ones who talk big talk."
Dean Boyd, a spokesman for the Justice Department, said the affidavit in the Khalifi case makes clear that "at each step, it was the defendant who proposed the alleged plot and sought help in obtaining the weapons to carry it out."
"Whenever we conduct an undercover operation of this sort, we fully anticipate that allegations of entrapment will be raised as a defense, and we conduct the investigation accordingly to assure that entrapment does not occur," he said.
Khalifi is due in court Wednesday afternoon for a preliminary hearing.

After U.N. vote, Syria continues crackdown

BYLINE: Reuters

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A08

LENGTH: 414 words

DATELINE: AMMAN, JORDAN

AMMAN, Jordan - Syrian government forces, disregarding U.N. condemnation of their violent suppression of a nationwide revolt, renewed a bombardment of the opposition stronghold of Homs and attacks on rebels in Daraa on Friday. 
Activists reported demonstrations against President Bashar al-Assad in several cities across Syria, including the capital, Damascus, and the commercial hub of Aleppo after Muslim prayers Friday, despite the threat of violence from security forces.
China's vice foreign minister, Zhai Jun, arrived in Damascus in a show of support for Assad after the U.N. General Assembly passed a resolution telling the increasingly isolated president to halt the crackdown and surrender power.
China, along with Russia, had voted against the motion and has said Syria must be allowed to resolve its problems without foreign powers dictating terms. China's stance on Syria will "withstand the test of history," Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Weimin said in Beijing.
Zhai said before leaving for Damascus: "China does not approve of the use of force to interfere in Syria or the forceful pushing of a so-called regime change."
The Chinese Embassy in Damascus said Zhai would hold talks with Assad on Saturday and also meet with opposition figures in Damascus. 
Meanwhile, government forces pummeled opposition-held areas of the strategic western city of Homs, which has been under fire for two weeks.
An intense bombardment hit the mainly Sunni Muslim area of Baba Amro after Alawite-led troops advanced from neighboring Inshaat, opposition activists there said.
"They are mostly firing rockets that directly fall onto buildings and mortar rounds now and then. Only Karama Street now separates Baba Amro from the army at Inshaat," activist Aba Iyad said by satellite phone from Baba Amro.
In Idlib, the capital of the rugged northwestern province bordering Turkey, two residents said tanks ringed the city at dawn. Residents were anticipating an assault.
"At every entrance of Idlib, several tanks deployed, along with pickup trucks used for troop transport," said a resident who gave his name as Fouad.
In Daraa, a city on the Jordanian border, where the revolt erupted nearly a year ago, explosions and machine-gun fire echoed through districts under attack by troops, residents said.
The military has also opened an offensive in Hama, a city with a bloody history of resistance to Assad's late father.
The Assads are Alawites, an offshoot of Shiite Islam, in the majority-Sunni country.

Jury finds man guilty of killing Md. state trooper

BYLINE: Matt Zapotosky

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B01

LENGTH: 594 words

A Seat Pleasant man who prosecutors say gunned down a Maryland state trooper to get revenge after the trooper threw him out of a restaurant was convicted Friday of first-degree murder and other related counts.
Jurors deliberated for about three hours before handing down the guilty verdicts against Cyril Williams, the man accused of shooting Maryland State Trooper Wesley Brown outside a Forestville Applebee's in June 2010. Law enforcement officials and family members who had packed a Prince George's County Circuit Court room to watch Williams's trial this week let out a hushed "Yes!" as the verdict was read.
"This is what we prayed for," said Janet Brown, the victim's sister. "We're happy that justice was served." 
Supporters of Williams, 29, left the courtroom hurriedly, shouting, "Hold your head up, dog!" as sheriff's deputies led him away.
From the start, the trial was emotional. Brown was a beloved trooper who had started a youth mentoring group in Seat Pleasant, and prosecutors accused Williams of callously ambushing him while he was working an off-duty security job. Brown, prosecutors said, had thrown Williams out of the Applebee's on Donnell Drive for being drunk and disorderly. They said Williams left to get a gun, drove back and opened fire on the restaurant's door when Brown stepped outside to talk on the phone.
"Hid behind a tree like the big man he was," Assistant State's Attorney Carol Coderre told jurors in her closing statement. "Fired each and every single bullet that the gun was capable of holding at Wesley Brown."
Defense lawyers had argued that there was not enough evidence to connect Williams to the shooting. Although one witness identified him as the shooter in court, she could not do so definitively in the past, said William Mitchell, an attorney for Williams. Other witnesses, Mitchell said, had provided only broad descriptions that matched Williams; prosecutors presented no DNA or fingerprint evidence.
"You don't convict on probablys, maybes and I suspects," Mitchell said.
But even if the prosecutors' case wasn't flawless, it was strong. Cellphone records showed Williams moving roughly from Applebee's to an area where he retrieved the gun, then back to Applebee's about the time of the killing. Anthony Milton, who has admitted giving Williams the gun and has pleaded guilty to being an accessory after the fact, testified that he drove with Williams to the restaurant and saw him shoot at the door.
And in the months after the incident, jailhouse informants and other witnesses testified, Williams bragged about killing a police officer and tried to intimidate an officer transporting him and another inmate, who planned to testify against him.
Brown, prosecutors said, was quite the opposite of his shooter - a community and family-oriented police officer who believed in second chances. Prosecutors said Brown let Williams go after Williams took a swing at another officer that night in June - even though the officer wanted to arrest Williams.
In her closing argument, Coderre urged jurors not to make the same decision.
"Don't let him go," Coderre said. "Just don't let him go."
Williams is scheduled to be sentenced May 10. Prince George's State's Attorney Angela D. Alsobrooks said prosecutors intend to ask that Williams serve life in prison without parole, noting the senseless motive that precipitated the crime.
"It's a complete waste," Alsobrooks said. "It's a tragedy of just horrific proportions."
William Brennan, another of Williams's attorneys, declined to comment after the verdict.

Whither Mexico's war on the drug cartels?

BYLINE: Nick Miroff

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A08

LENGTH: 1248 words

DATELINE: IN MEXICO CITY

Mexico's drug war has cost 50,000 lives since President Felipe Calderon took office in December 2006, and when voters go to the polls to elect a new leader July 1, that dreadful figure may cost his party the presidency.http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/americas/after-5-years-mexicos-drug-war-still-rages/2011/12/10/gIQAIocUlO_story.html" title="www.washingtonpost.com
Ever-expanding violence and insecurity have left many Mexicans desperate for a leader who can stem the killings and pacify the gangsters. But public frustration has not translated into a substantive policy debate about how to change course, and political analysts say whoever succeeds Calderon will probably continue fighting the cartels in similar fashion - by working closely with the United States and relying heavily on the Mexican military.
"The majority of Mexicans want a change in strategy, but it's more of a gut feeling that they want something different than a clear sense of what to do," said independent pollster Jorge Buendia. 
In surveys, security and job creation are consistently the two most important issues cited by respondents, Buendia said, but so far the presidential candidates have generally avoided the issues. "Reporters don't ask, and they never move beyond generalities," he said.
When pressed for specifics, the candidates tend to offer airy platitudes instead.
Even the candidate projected to benefit most from Calderon's struggles - Enrique Pena Nieto, nominee of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) - has avoided staking out firm positions on security issues.
Pena Nieto has criticized Calderon as not having a "clear" diagnosis before launching a "hasty" offensive against the cartels, and he said he was in favor of withdrawing Mexican troops from city streets - but gradually, with no timetable.
"I've been the first to recognize that the federal government's decision to take a tough stand and use the army against organized crime was the best option at the time, since the state has an irrefutable obligation to guarantee the security of the people," he said in a recent speech.

Limited options
The presidential vote is set for July 1, but Mexico's campaign season will not be in full swing until next month. For now, contenders are still technically considered "pre-candidates," barred from spending and stumping as official nominees. But for all practical purposes, a three-way presidential contest is well underway.
The PRI has placed its hopes for a comeback on Pena Nieto, the telegenic former governor of the state of Mexico, the country's most populous. For months he has held a double-digit lead over potential rivals in polls, but his momentum has been slowed by stumbles and by insinuations from opponents - and Calderon - that his party will go soft on the traffickers.
A Pena Nieto victory would return his party to an office it lost in 2000 after ruling for 71 years through an extensive network of patronage, corruption and Mexican-style machine politics. But Pena Nieto is not seen as a shoo-in.
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the former Mexico City mayor, will run against him as the candidate of the left-leaning Revolutionary Democratic Party (PRD). Lopez Obrador lost to Calderon in 2006 by such a narrow margin that he refused to accept the results and spent more than a year calling himself "Mexico's legitimate president." He remains rock-star popular with many of Mexico's poor.
More than any candidate in the race, Lopez Obrador has made an issue of the Mexican government's drug war strategy. He promises to send the military back to its barracks within six months of taking office and to focus instead on the underlying social causes of rampant criminal violence.
Analysts say that's not necessarily the policy shift Mexican voters are looking for, but options are limited. A new president could push for the elimination of low-paid local-level police departments - ripe targets for cartel recruitment - in favor of state-level forces. The country's law enforcement and security bureaucracies could be consolidated under a single crime-fighting agency. And a new president could decide to give the Drug Enforcement Administration and other U.S. agencies more latitude to operate in Mexico, or less.
"Everyone knows the current strategy of taking the cartels head-on is not working," said Karen Hooper, a Latin America policy expert at Statfor, the Texas-based security-analysis firm. "But I don't see advocating a pullback of the military as a winning strategy - either rhetorically or as a policy proposal."

Risk of tainted election
Today about 50,000 Mexican soldiers and marines, sporting full body armor and machine guns, patrol the country's highways and urban neighborhoods. Despite allegations of human rights abuses, the Mexican military remains one of the country's best-regarded institutions, analysts say, and in some places, it's the only public security force standing between relative order and criminal chaos.
Because Mexican presidents are limited to a single, six-year term, Calderon is ineligible for reelection. His National Action Party (PAN) has nominated former education secretary Josefina Vazquez Mota, who pledges to press ahead with Calderon's fight and to up the ante by threatening lifetime prison sentences for politicians and public officials caught working for the cartels.
But she too has repeatedly ducked requests for more detailed proposals, while running television advertisements warning voters against choosing politicians with ties to organized crime - a not-so-subtle dig at Pena Nieto as the PRI candidate.
Mexican campaign regulators have warned that this year's election is more at risk of being tainted by dirty drug money than any previous contest, while PRI party leaders have accused Calderon of sending federal investigators to carry out a "witch hunt" and a "dirty war" against them.
Federal prosecutors announced Jan. 31 that they are investigating former officials in the border state of Tamaulipas, including three former PRI governors. A few days earlier, a state official from the PRI-controlled state of Veracruz was found carrying $1.9 million in cash at a Mexico City area airport, and the party's opponents quickly alleged that the money was part of a secret campaign slush fund for Pena Nieto.
Still, analysts say Pena Nieto might benefit from the perception that Calderon's failure hasn't been one of policy but party affiliation. Because PRI governors control 20 of Mexico's 31 states, voters may think that Pena Nieto could adopt a similar military strategy but carry it out more effectively by closing ranks among state-level officials.
And he's so far ahead in the polls that there's little incentive to lay out specific policy proposals at this stage, said George Grayson, a Mexico scholar at Virginia's College of William and Mary. "Pena Nieto is in a glide pattern right now," Grayson said.
If Pena Nieto does win the presidency, Grayson said, he will probably enhance Mexico's cooperation with the United States, despite rumblings from some in his party who have attacked Calderon for allowing an expanded U.S. military and intelligence presence inside Mexico.
"He'll follow Calderon's example," Grayson said. "One, because he's smart, but also because he doesn't have a toxic sense of nationalism."

Dupont Circle site of 3 early-morning robberies

BYLINE: Martin Weil

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B04

LENGTH: 191 words

Many recent robberies in the District have targeted cellphones, but in three street holdups on Thursday in a downtown zone of hotels, offices and restaurants, the thieves were after cash. 
In each of the three Thursday robberies, all carried out before sunrise within a few blocks of Dupont Circle, the robber carried a gun and, according to police, "demanded money."
There was no indication that phones were involved.
This contrasted in part with two armed street robberies that occurred late Monday in upper Northwest, one at 10:15 p.m. in the 5200 block of Western Avenue NW and the other about five minutes later near Wisconsin Avenue and Garrison Street. In those, robbers got both cash and phones.
Police were told that both of the Monday holdups involved three robbers, all in masks.
On Thursday, the first robbery occurred about 3:10 a.m. at Connecticut Avenue and R Street NW, about two blocks above the circle. The second came about 6:10 a.m. at 20th and N streets NW, and the third a few minutes later, at 16th and M streets NW, about six blocks north of the White House.
In each case, the robber got cash and fled, police said.

A leading fashion photographer of the 20th century

BYLINE: Susan Denley;- Los Angeles Times

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B06

LENGTH: 641 words

"I didn't bring you to Paris to make art; I brought you here to do the buttons and bows," Harper's Bazaar editor Carmel Snow snapped at photographer Lillian Bassman during a fashion shoot for the magazine in the late 1940s.
But Ms. Bassman's fashion photographs are considered to be among the greatest of the 20th century - in a league with other creative masters, including Richard Avedon and Irving Penn - and an inspiration to such designers as John Galliano as well as the subject of exhibitions around the globe. 
Her photos captured a mid-century world of elegant, slightly elongated women, impeccably dressed, done up in high-contrast black and white. Avedon once described her style as making "visible that heartbreaking invisible place between the appearance and the disappearance of things."
Ms. Bassman, 94, died Feb. 13 at her home in Manhattan, her son Eric Himmel said. No cause of death was disclosed.
Lillian Bassman was born June 15, 1917, in New York, the daughter of Russian Jewish immigrants who allowed her to live a bohemian life from a young age. She met her future husband, photographer and psychotherapist Paul Himmel, at Coney Island when she was 6 and he was 9, and began living with him at 15 with her parents' blessing.
In her youth, she reportedly danced with Martha Graham, posed nude at the Art Students League and, with Himmel, spent many hours at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where she studied the great painters and began to formulate her distinctive vision and style. El Greco was a favorite.
She studied fabric design at a vocational school and became a painter and graphic designer. Eventually, she met Alexey Brodovitch, art director of Harper's Bazaar, and enrolled in his design lab class. Brodovitch invited her to join him as his assistant at Harper's. In 1945, when Junior Bazaar debuted, she became co-art director with Brodovitch.
In that capacity, she chose and prominently displayed the work of budding photographic stars, including Avedon, Robert Frank and Louis Faurer. She began frequenting the darkroom, and when Avedon went off to Paris on assignment in 1947, he lent her his studio and the use of his assistant. By 1948, she had given up art direction for full-time photography.
A female fashion photographer was rare in those days, and Ms. Bassman was able to develop a special rapport with her models.
Ms. Bassman's photography was informed by her work as a painter.
"I spent my life in the museums studying the old masters," she told the Los Angeles Times in 2010. "Elegance goes back to the earliest paintings. Long necks. The thrust of the head in a certain position. The way the fingers work, fabrics work. It's all part of my painting background."
Galliano, when he was creative director for Christian Dior, said he had been inspired by Ms. Bassman's photographs, with their "painterly strokes of light." And Kate Spade's creative director Deborah Lloyd cited Ms. Bassman's photographs of the period as an inspiration for a collection in the fall.
By the early 1970s, Ms. Bassman had become disenchanted with the direction fashion photography had taken and with the advent of the era of supermodels. She destroyed most of her commercial negatives, bundled others into trash bags stored in her carriage house and turned to more artistic photographic endeavors, shooting still lifes and nudes.
In 1991, photo historian Martin Harrison spotted the surviving fashion negatives and pushed Ms. Bassman to begin working in the field again. She did, shooting Paris couture for the New York Times magazine and an ad campaign for Neiman Marcus, among other assignments. In more recent years, she began using digital techniques to reinvent her old photographs.
Paul Himmel, whom Ms. Bassman married in 1935, died in 2009.
Besides their son, she is survived by a daughter and three grandchildren.

Nail guns can be helpful but dangerous

I've always wanted a powered nail gun to do rough carpentry. They're expensive, but I feel I'll get value out of it for all the projects I've got in my future. There are air- and gas-powered tools available. It can be pretty confusing. What are the pros and cons of the different tools? And do you have any tips to share? - Brian S., Buffalo
Oh, if I had a penny for every nail I've shot with my different framing-nail guns, I just might give Sir Richard Branson an offer to buy his Necker Island paradise! I can tell you these tools are enormous time savers, and they're wicked machines that can be deadly. They must be treated just the same as you would treat a loaded handgun or a rifle. 
Let's talk about what these tools can do first. Most of them shoot an assortment of nails that allow you to do just about every rough carpentry task I can think of. You can bang together stud walls, laminate structural headers, or attach plywood or oriented strand board sheathing to walls and roofs.
The tools can be adjusted so that you drive the nail the proper depth. Be certain that you always follow the building code requirements for the type of nail, the shape of the head and the depth to which it must be driven. Be sure the nail gun you decide to purchase will work with code-compliant nails.
Thirty years ago, I was using the most popular and rugged nail gun that was made at the time. My Senco SN4 gun was an air-powered beast and drove thousands of nails per workday without jamming. It worked tirelessly from sunup to sundown. You just had to feed it a couple of drops of oil each morning, and it was happy as a clam.
My Senco gun got it's air from a gasoline-powered air compressor. This machine was an extra expense, it needed fuel and it required regular maintenance so that it would start. It was also noisy. Many carpenters use much quieter electric compressors. The advantage of my compressor is that it could be used where there was no electric.
Some years later, I switched to an impluse gas nail gun made by Paslode. Oh, my, did that gun become my favorite. To be free of the heavy compressor, the hoses, the noise - that was really liberating. I could have 50 nails shot or more with that gun long before you would have my old Senco up and running. The impluse gun just needed its battery charged each night. It always had enough power to operate all day long.
You can get electric-powered nail guns, but the only ones I've seen in use are finish nailers. Something tells me it will take a significant advancement in technology to have a cordless battery-powered framing nail gun.
Before you make your final purchasing decision, be sure to calculate all the costs. If you decide to go with an air tool, you'll need a a compressor, hoses, fittings, etc. Think what will happen if you need to use the tool somewhere else and how you will get all that gear to the job site.
With my impulse nailer, the entire tool and everything you need fits into a small case you easily carry with one hand. I can take it anywhere I want. I can even use it at a remote site all day where there is no power. I just need to charge the battery pack at night back home or at a cabin.
Safety is something you must think about all the time with nail guns. They call them guns for a reason. People have been killed and seriously injured with them. On one of my jobs years ago, one of my helpers nailed his big toe to the sub-flooring because he was going too fast. I almost had a 16d framing nail shoot into my chest one day because I was doing something foolish. On another job, an air-powered nailer shot two nails in quick succession because of a hair trigger. The gun bounced off the stud, hit me in the head, broke my glasses and knocked me off the ladder. When I came to, blood was streaming down my face. Three hours and four stitches later, I was back on the job site. Do I have your attention yet? Treat these tools with the utmost respect.

Same-sex marriage vetoed by Christie
Gov. Chris Christie (R) has backed up his promise to reject a bill allowing same-sex marriages in New Jersey.
His veto came Friday, a day after the state's lower house, the Assembly, passed the bill. The Senate had approved it Monday. 
Christie returned the bill to the legislature, saying he wants voters to decide.
Democratic lawmakers say it's a civil rights issue that shouldn't be put to a public vote.
Lawmakers have until the end of the January 2014 legislative session to override the veto. They would need to get two-thirds of the lawmakers in the Assembly and Senate to agree. The votes to pass the same-sex marriage bill fell short of that mark in both houses.
The Democratic-controlled legislature has been unsuccessful in attempts to override Christie's vetoes.

Soldier may see charge dropped
 Federal prosecutors asked Friday that a judge dismiss the criminal charge against a soldier who was arrested at a Texas airport in December after trying to bring military-grade explosives on a cross-country flight.
In their motion, prosecutors said there was insufficient evidence to prove Sgt. 1st Class Trey Scott Atwater knew he was carrying the explosives when he was arrested at Midland International Airport on Dec. 31.
According to the motion, the FBI found that Atwater, a Special Forces demolitions expert, routinely carried quantities of C-4 explosives in his backpack while serving in Afghanistan.

Senator continues recovery:Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) has started walking on a treadmill as he recovers from a January stroke. Doctors expect Kirk to have limited movement on his left side but think he will make a full mental recovery.
Girl charged in Columbine attack: Prosecutors have filed charges against a 14-year-old girl suspected in a hammer attack that injured two students at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo. Monday's attack was the first assault with a weapon at the school since the 1999 shootings that left 12 students, a teacher and the two teen gunmen dead.
ICE shooting came during review: The FBI says Thursday's shooting in a Southern California Immigration and Customs Enforcement office occurred as an agent was being counseled on his performance by a high-ranking ICE official. A supervisor was wounded, and the gunman was killed.
Capitol explosives were fireworks: Explosives found in a pickup parked near the Kansas Capitol this week were illegal homemade fireworks, the state Highway Patrol said Friday. Police still want a prosecutor to file charges against the truck's owner.

DATELINE: IN PROVO, UTAH

In room 539 of the J. Rueben Clark Library, Willard Mitt Romney, a 23-year-old English major, sat at the round wooden table in his World Classics 1 literature class with four other Brigham Young University students. Three days a week in 1970, the young Mormons walked under the school's iconic Y mountain, named for a 380-foot concrete letter built into the hillside, then past a bronze statue of church prophet Brigham Young and into the windowless classroom to discuss the great books. 
They talked about how writers from the Greeks to Dante illuminated the world in preparation for the moment in 1830 when the true gospel, as understood by the Mormon church, was restored. Professor Charles Tate encouraged his students to draw connections between the revelation of Mormon scripture and the universal story of the Odyssey, Homer's epic poem of coming home.  
For Romney and other students returning from Mormon missions or arriving in Utah for the first time from out of state, BYU offered its own homecoming. The son of Michigan governor George Romney, Mitt had grown up in Bloomfield Hills amid few Mormons, studied briefly at Stanford University, and done a long, tragedy-marred mission in Le Havre and other French cities forged by Catholicism and unhinged by social upheaval. In February 1969, he enrolled in the church-owned university and, for the first time in his life, found himself entirely among brethren in his faith. 
Romney's later experiences as a Harvard Law and Business School phenomenon, high-flying financial consultant, and governor of Massachusetts all helped shape the candidate now seeking the Republican nomination for president. But his two years on the BYU campus set the mold into which all else poured. It was here that he finally got the girl, started a family, and immersed himself in the rituals and works of his church. Having grown out of his adolescent awkwardness and shed his reputation as a prankster, he turned into an assiduous student, deliberated between a career in business or the academy, and transformed an elite social club of blazer-clad young men into a fund-raising powerhouse. 
And yet even as Romney wrapped himself in the warm blue blanket of the BYU campus, its fabric frayed. He attended Brigham Young during its most volatile period, when protests over the war in Vietnam and outrage over the church ban on blacks in the Mormon priesthood had penetrated Provo and rattled a conservative enclave traditionally immune to discord. Liberals took over the student body leadership, and administration figures retaliated by organizing spy rings on activist students and sympathetic teachers. Even as Romney's father, by then an unsuccessful presidential candidate who had joined the Nixon cabinet, addressed the student body about the injustices of racial inequality and the tragedy of the war, his son shut out the formative issues of his day as distractions from the Mormon blueprint of family, faith and hard work. 
On the campaign trail today, Romney often seems outside his comfort zone, but four decades ago on the college campus, he exuded the confidence of a young man utterly at home in his world. That sense of ease was apparent even when Professor Tate popped a surprise oral exam on his literature class, a scene he recalled recently as he sat in his book-lined living room looking through bifocals at Romney's old report card. 
"I went down the line from right to left asking the question. The first one said 'I can't do it' and the next one, 'I don't know it,' and the next one the same. And then I said, 'OK, now you Brother Romney.' And he said 'OK, Brother Tate. You've humbled us. Now ask us a question we can answer.'"
* * *
In a commencement address not long before Romney arrived at Brigham Young, Ernest L. Wilkinson, the university's president, declared that the obtaining of a spouse was "more important than the obtaining of a degree." He called his campus "the happiest hunting ground in the world." The words had a special meaning for Mitt Romney. He was drawn to BYU not only to get closer to his church, but also to seal the deal with his high school sweetheart and persuade her to marry him.
When he left high school in suburban Detroit and went out to Stanford, the notion of finishing his college career at the Mormon school in Utah was out of the question. "The one place I will not go is BYU!" he told his father, as George Romney later recounted the scene. But an unforeseen challenge to Mitt's relationship with his longtime girlfriend, Ann Davies, changed his perspective. Suddenly, BYU was the one place he had to be. 
Ann, three years behind him in school, had enrolled at Brigham Young in 1967, during a period when Romney had left Stanford after his first year to perform Mormon missionary work in France. Mitt's father, then the governor, had played a key role in all of this, personally baptizing Ann and her brother into the fold of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Ann started her freshman year in Provo in 1967 while Mitt was off knocking on doors and seeking converts as a missionary, a task that earned him a draft deferment from his Michigan draft board. Early the next year Ann came to France for a semester abroad, though the couple could not get together. Church rules barred the two from seeing each other. Their only connection came via one of the church apostles, and later church president, Howard Hunter, who met Ann in Grenoble with a message of greeting from Mitt, according to Donlu Thayer, who studied with Ann at the time.
Soon after Ann returned to the Brigham Young campus, Romney was shaken by successive traumas overseas. In the summer, a speeding car driven by a French priest crashed into a Citroen DS driven by Romney, killing the wife of the mission president who was seated beside him. "We have just learned that President and Sister H. Duane Anderson of the French Mission were involved in a serious head-on collision on the evening of Monday, June 17th," read the Progress French East Mission report on June 15, 1968. "Sister Anderson passes away within hours of the accident and President Anderson was seriously injured with broken ribs and a broken wrist. Other passengers in the car were injured, apparently not too seriously." 
In fact, Romney did suffer serious injuries, so much so that authorities at the scene first thought he was dead. But he recovered quickly, only to receive another emotional blow. One of the dreaded Dear John letters that papered the walls of Mormon missions around the world arrived with his name on it. Davies wrote to him that back at BYU she had started dating Kim S. Cameron, a future student body vice president who would be voted the school's "most preferred man." 
Romney took the news hard; described by friends as being "useless" and "near tears." He pressed intensely for reconciliation through a series of urgent letters. When he finally won Ann back, he agreed to her request that he join her in Provo for at least one semester. "Well, I'll go for one; then we'll both go to Stanford," Mitt responded, according to his father. He got there in February 1969, and the couple stayed in Utah. As the elder Romney later explained at a devotional address to the student body in 1970, when Ann and Mitt were there together, "Now he is just like the rest of you brainwashed students - he thinks BYU is the best university in the country." By then, the couple had married and moved into a shabby railroad basement apartment, cracked tiles in the kitchen floor. McBride, also newly married and renting upstairs in the three-story brick building close to campus, would come down with his wife for improvised spaghetti dinners at which the men would reprise jovial songs from their missionary days. The Romney's first son, Taggart, was brought home to that apartment, and stayed in a crib at the foot of their bed.
"I remember Mitt explaining to me the benefits of married life," said Clayton F. Foulger, a close friend who water-skied with Romney on Lake Utah and still spends summers at the family vacation home on Lake Winnipesaukee in New Hampshire. "He didn't have to explain a lot. It was sort of self-evident. But he was appreciative of it, I'll tell you." The benefits of undergraduate matrimony are still promoted on campus. One recent afternoon in the Wilkinson Center, named for the late college president, stacks of "Bridal Guide" magazine stood under posters advertising a "Premarital Workshop" ("The proposal went wellג[#x20ac]¦ Now what?") 
* * * 
BYU observes an honor code, a list of policies requiring students to live a chaste and virtuous life, use clean language, abstain from alcoholic beverages, tobacco, tea, coffee, and substance abuse, participate regularly in church services, and observe the dress and grooming standards. The school's honor code burst into the national news last spring when a star basketball player, Brandon Davies, was suspended shortly before the NCAA tournament for having sex with his girlfriend.
On a recent afternoon, Erica and Jessie Allen, two sisters from Harrisburg Va., tried to get students involved in Honor Week 2012. 
"It's a question about the honor code. If you get it right, you'll be entered into a drawing for a prize," Erica called out to passersby in the Wilkinson Center. Many students stopped to fill out their answers to questions like "What may result from Honor Code violations?" Her sister, meantime, was explaining how central the honor code was to the school's purpose. "The honor code was important than the national title [in basketball]," she said. "Brigham Young said don't even teach the alphabet without the Spirit of God." 
In the era of Mitt Romney, the honor code was only one aspect of a conservative ethos enforced by President Wilkinson. 
After an unsuccessful bid for the U.S. Senate in 1964 on the Goldwater line, the hard-line anti-communist returned to campus, where some students and teachers quipped about his fictitious memoir Mien Campus. Wilkinson, along with Willard Cleon Skousen, a former Salt Lake City police chief, John Birch society booster and professor of religion at BYU, began running student spy rings on teachers and activist students. In commencement addresses, Wilkinson spoke out against birth control and "the social evils of today, such as beatniks, hippies, drug addicts, free-lovers, college rioters and others who would completely remove cleanliness, morality and all other Christian virtues from our civilization." He said student radicals should have "their citizenship revoked." 
A strong conservative streak also ran through the classrooms, though some professors in Romney's English department did their best to avoid Wilkinson and give their students a broader education. Reading lists addressed the ideas of the civil rights movement. Faulkner replaced Hemingway on some syllabuses. Richard Cracroft, a professor who went on to chair the English department, said that he and others found ways to teach controversial novels like "One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest" and "Catcher in the Rye," though some established works could cause them headaches. 
"These people would go right to the first presidency of the church," he said, referring to the church's highest governing body. "And say, 'Cracroft is teaching this play by Shakespeare and it is filthy.'" 
But the campus was changing. More liberal students poured over their copies of Dialogue, a new journal of Mormon thought, and attended campus debates at the Joseph Smith auditorium between hard line and progressive religion professors. 
In 1969, the year Romney arrived, students elected a liberal named Brian Walton as their president despite the administration's attempts to nullify the results. "It was an unbelievably conservative place," said Walton, who later left the church and became a chief negotiator for the Screen Writers Guild in Los Angeles. "You wouldn't believe the things some people were saying -- complaining about the civil rights laws, that it would take away their rights." 
"When we did all this stuff on Vietnam it was like the first turmoil BYU had had," said Jon Ferguson, Walton's vice president who also ultimately left the church and wrote several novels, including The Missionary, about a young Mormon who loses faith in France. "BYU has never had so much excitement." Walton and Ferguson also sought to allay anger over the church doctrine banning black priests by meeting with black student unions around the country.
Romney navigated a vastly different world. "You didn't think too much of people who were going out to try and demonstrate to persuade the brethren," said his friend Dane McBride, who noted that only a revelation from the church president could change the doctrine. "It's not something [Mitt] would have done. From a church and priesthood leadership perspective, it would be unseemly as well as useless."
During Romney's junior year, Wilkinson issued a flier titled "Men of BYU-A Message from the President," encouraging participation in the army reserves. Walton, Ferguson and others responded at a special ceremony with 500 copies of "An Important Message to the Men of BYU," that urged alternatives to military service. When a copy reached Wilkinson on the stage in the fieldhouse, he shook with rage. 
"It was a compilation of quotes from the Bible, the Book of Mormon and presidents and high-ranking officials in the Mormon Church about the horrors and evils of war and warfare," said Terrell Hunt, one of the pamphlet's authors, and one of the few politically liberal members in Romney's university booster organization, the Cougar Club. "It would never occur to us to ask Mitt Romney to sign that thing." That sort of thing, in fact, was one of the reasons Romney felt no desire to return to Stanford, where, as a freshman he had once waved a "Speak Out, Don't Sit In" sign at protesters. He had thought BYU would be an escape from all of that. "Let's face it, at Stanford and Berkeley, self-respecting college students were taking over the president's office and ransacking it," said McBride. 
* * *
Romney's aversion to anti-establishment activity, his friends said, was rooted in his religion, specifically Joseph Smith's explanation that "We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers and magistrates in obeying, honoring and sustaining the law." This was "not just a code of conduct," explained Clayton Foulger. "It really is belief, and everything sort of arises from that." 
Religion was a major dimension of Romney's life at BYU, as it has been ever since. The Mormon church is broken up into geographical jurisdictions called stakes, which are comprised of congregations called wards. In Provo, Romney answered a church calling to be one of two counselors to a lay bishop in his student ward. 
At that time, Provo had no Mormon temple, a sacred space within which the faith's most holy rituals, including marriage sealings, endowments and proxy baptisms for the dead, can be performed. Mitt and Ann had been married for eternity in the Salt Lake Temple, the towering Quartz monzonite landmark in Temple Square. As students, in possession of a "temple recommend" (a church-issued stamp of good standing), they traveled the hour north from Provo to Salt Lake several times with the McBrides to perform church rituals. 
"It was usually for just regular temple work," said McBride. "Doing the proxy work for someone who is deceased."
Mormons believe that baptism is an essential right of passage to salvation, that it was performed on the dead in the time of the apostle Paul, and that Joseph Smith restored the practice after a millennia of apostasy. They hold that the ritual offers a second chance to accept Christ in the afterlife for those who died before the restoration of the Mormon church, as well as for those who failed to receive Mormon baptism since the church's establishment. At the temple, the Romneys would have entered a special room where a proxy, clad in white robes, waded into a large baptismal font resting on the backs of 12 sculpted oxen. The proxy then was vicariously baptized in the name of deceased people, often, but not always, relatives. (Ann's own father, Edward R. Davies, a life-long nonbeliever, received the rite a year after his death.) 
Romney's involvement in the church extended beyond rituals and into the good works central to a religion forged by pioneers. He helped lead a church-run effort to clean the Provo River, and impressed his fellow students as a gifted speaker. One morning at the Provo Tabernacle, the presiding church authority announced that Romney would give some remarks after an opening prayer and song. Yet Romney was nowhere to be seen. 
"I thought 'Oh my Gosh, here Mitt is, a real straight shooter and he was going to be hugely embarrassed,'" said Tristan Pico a friend of Romney's and Cougar Club member. Pico had bumped into the Romneys at the movies the night before for a showing of "The Arrangement," a poorly received melodrama about a philandering ad man who gets into a car crash, and he wondered if Romney had slept late. The couple arrived soon after, and Romney's head jerked to attention when someone whispered in his ear that his name had been called. He calmly walked to the front of the congregation and delivered a sermon based on the life lessons he had gleaned from the movie. "One of which was that one had to know who they were," recalled Pico, "and have the ability to act on that throughout their life and be consistent and good."
* * *
Along with finding spouses and affirming their faiths, the BYU experience was also meant to emphasize making a living, professional success, as a means of strengthening the Mormon family. Mitt's father, before entering politics, had made a fortune turning around American Motors Corporation with the Rambler, and now the son obsessed over how he would make his own entrepreneurial mark. 
"I remember him saying, 'Golly, Dane, you're so lucky,'" said McBride, then a pre-med student. "'I don't have a clue what I'm going to be doing, you know. I don't know how I'm going to make a living for my family."
But during his first summer break from BYU, Romney had an idea. He had persuaded a corporation called Edcor that he could make them a bundle selling their new cordless microphones around the Michigan area. He and his new wife returned from Utah to the home of her parents in Bloomfield Hills. There, Romney called on former mission companions from his days in France and sent them out to knock on doors to sell microphones in the same way they had their church. Though he expected a windfall of about $10,000 each in commissions, Romney ended up making a few thousand dollars, while his former missionary friends fared worse, relying on Ann's mother for meals of pancakes or lasagna. 
When he returned to campus, his financial acumen sharpened, to the benefit of the school. On page 379 in the 1971 school yearbook, Romney is seen kneeling in blazer and slacks with the other "Cougar Men" in front of a pond on a farm outside Provo. The opposite page reads "What student group would accept the challenge to raise $100,000 in twelve months' time? Cougar Club did without hesitation." 
"I remember the first time I rushed Cougar Club I didn't get in which of course was devastating," said Merril Dayton, now a doctor in Buffalo. "When I did get in, they said, 'Did you know that Governor Romney has a son in Cougar Club?' I said 'No, I didn't, What's his name.' And they said 'Mitt Romney. In fact, he's running for president of Cougar Club."
Romney gained a reputation for decisively presiding over meetings in the old alumni house and vastly improving on the tenure of his predecessor, who happened to be Kim Cameron, his wife's onetime suitor. In addition to the traditional sale of chrysanthemums for homecoming, and pushing records of BYU fight songs and tickets to football games, Romney "did things in Cougar Club that had never been done before," according to Clint Hunter, a junior member of the club. "Mitt had much grander concepts of how you raise money."
He invited speakers to address the club, including Stephen Covey, a BYU professor who later became famous for authoring "Seven Habits of Highly Effective People," and followed some of their advice by masterminding a high-octane fund-raising drive. 
"He proposed, 'Why don't we leave this school that we love so much a real legacy,'" said McBride, adding that instead of raising the usual ten or twelve thousand dollars, he suggested a goal of $100,000. "Some of the guys said, 'Mitt you can only have only so many luaus a year you know.' He said, 'What if we can get the school administration to share with us the contact information of everybody who has ever matriculated through the school.' And we set up phone banks and got the students to make these calls as volunteers."
Romney also worked out a deal with a local car dealership so that the Cougar Men, along with their wives or girlfriends, would pick up prospective donors in new, polished cars for a spring day of activities and presentations. When rival universities, furious about the Mormon church's ban on blacks in the priesthood, caused disturbances at games, the Cougar Club felt under siege, according to McBride. "Can you believe these guys doing this to us?" was how Romney and other club leaders felt, McBride said. Their response was to "raise more money for the school."
In October 1997, Romney, then Managing Director, Bain Capital Inc., returned to campus as the College of Humanities' honored alumnus and gave a lecture called "Defying the Experts: How to Win in the Games of Life." As part of the program, Kristine Hansen, a former classmate and now an English professor at the university, presented Romney with membership to the school's Phi Kappa Phi society of academic achievers. He graciously received the honor, and then joked that the society had invited him to join as a student, but that he declined "'because it cost money,'" recalled Hansen, who had declined the honor herself as a student because she couldn't afford the nominal fee. "I thought, 'You could have paid that,'" she said. "To me it wasn't that funny." 
* * *
As a student in the clubby Honors Program, a version of a great books liberal arts college within the wider university, Romney made a point of greeting teachers in the hall. C. Terry Warner, a Yale-trained philosophy professor who ran the program, was so close to Romney that the two played the market together and took a bath on some bad stocks. 
Besides acting as Mitt's financial adviser, Warner taught him to seek echoes of major philosophical insights in the church's own intellectual and religious tradition and to feel free to express those connections. "It's like the censorship is removed and you can enunciate the strengths you've always believed in," Warner said. 
Romney's seriousness as a student impressed many classmates, who considered him exceptionally well prepared, and typical of the ambitious pre-law or business students who matriculated through the English department. But his teacher's pet persona rubbed some students the wrong way.
Hunt, whose antiestablishment persona included the sporting of a controversial mustache, took Warner's philosophy class with Romney. When Warner sharply critiqued Hunt's 100-page final paper, the student responded with a letter asking, "Is the analysis on comments you made on my paper typical to the comments you made on other students in the class? In fact, I'd like to see your comments on Mitt Romney's paper." 
In a botany class, Kristine Hansen recalled Romney as someone "full of himself" and "very aware of who he was. He realized he was good looking and the son of a famous man. When he walked into the class it was like 'Mitt's here.'"
And yet Romney apparently had a more sensitive side, harboring a deeper love of literature discordant with his present strictly-business mien and a politician who cites "Battleship Earth" as a favorite read. The chair of the English department at the time, Marshall Craig, liked telling a story about how Romney, when approaching graduation, came to him seeking advice on pursuing a doctorate in English literature. 
"You can afford to read all the books you'd like, but why would you get a PhD and starve," Craig often recounted telling Romney, according to John Tanner, an English professor and currently the head of the Sֳ£o Paulo South Mission in Brazil. "You should get an MBA."
On May 5, 1971, the university held its Honors Program Banquet at the Wilkinson Center. After listening to a movement from Mozart's Dissonant Quartet, the students paid tribute to the 11 students, including Romney, who earned Cum Laude recognition for a grade point average between 3.5 and 3.79 and performed well enough on rigorous exit interviews to receive highest honors. The banquet program noted that Romney indeed would attend Harvard to pursue an MBA. At graduation in August, he again followed in his competitor Kim Cameron's footsteps and delivered the "Expression from Graduates" address.

More than 40 years after Romney left Brigham Young, on the eve of the South Carolina primary, McBride attended a Romney campaign event and caught the candidate's eye on a rope line. Romney wrote down a number and asked his old college pal to give him a call late that night. 
"'Well, it looks like we're not going to do all that well tomorrow. But I want you to know that it means a whole lot to me that you're here,'" Romney said. The two old friends then reminisced about their days in Provo and in France, and recalled the parody songs they had written to raise morale for missionaries and the way they sang them to their newlywed wives in the tiny basement apartment in Provo. 
We Elders of Angouleme are
broke, hungry and no check from afar
Eating solely ravioli
out of a mason jar
To the tune of "We Three Kings of Orient Are," Mitt and his pal rounded into the chorus:
Oh, woe, starving elders man the fight
to keep vultures out of sight,
will we make it or forsake it
to seek food in the street tonight.

Reluctant Romney found his footing at BYU

DATELINE: IN PROVO, UTAH

In Room 539 of the J. Reuben Clark Library, Willard Mitt Romney, a 23-year-old English major, sat at the round wooden table in his World Classics 1 literature class with a handful of other Brigham Young University students. Three days a week, the young Mormons walked under the school's iconic Y Mountain, named for a 380-foot concrete letter built into the hillside, then past a bronze statue of church prophet Brigham Young and into the windowless classroom to discuss the great books.
They talked about how writers from the Greeks to Dante illuminated the world in preparation for the moment in the 19th century when the true gospel, as understood by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, was restored. Professor Charles Tate encouraged his students to draw connections between the revelation of Mormon scripture and the universal story of "The Odyssey," Homer's epic poem of coming home. 
For Romney and other students returning from Mormon missions or arriving in Utah for the first time from out of state, BYU offered its own homecoming. The son of Michigan Gov. George Romney, Mitt had grown up in Bloomfield Hills among few Mormons, studied briefly at Stanford University and completed a long, tragedy-marred mission in Le Havre and other French cities forged by Catholicism and unhinged by social upheaval. In February 1969, he enrolled in the church-owned university and, for the first time in his life, found himself entirely among brethren in his faith.
Mitt Romney's later experiences as a phenomenon at Harvard Law and Business schools, a high-flying financial consultant, and governor of Massachusetts all helped shape the candidate now seeking the Republican nomination for president. But his two years on the BYU campus set the mold into which all else poured. It was here that he finally got the girl, started a family and immersed himself in the rituals and works of his church. Having grown out of his adolescent awkwardness and shed his reputation as a prankster, he turned into an assiduous student, deliberated between a career in business or scholarship, and transformed an elite social club of blazer-clad young men into a fundraising powerhouse.
And yet even as Romney wrapped himself in the warm blue blanket of the BYU campus, its fabric frayed. He attended Brigham Young during its most volatile period, when protests over the war in Vietnam and outrage over the church ban on blacks in the Mormon priesthood had penetrated Provo and rattled a conservative enclave traditionally immune to discord. Liberals took over the student body leadership, and administration figures retaliated by organizing spy rings on activist students and sympathetic teachers.
And while Romney's father, by then an unsuccessful presidential candidate who had joined the Nixon Cabinet, addressed the student body about the injustices of racial inequality and the tragedy of the war, his son shut out the formative issues of his day as destructive distractions. Instead, he turned to the traditional Mormon tenets of family, faith and hard work as the blueprint for building a safer, more impenetrable place for himself.
On the trail today, Mitt Romney, whose campaign declined to comment for this story, often seems outside his comfort zone. But four decades ago on the orderly college campus, he exuded the confidence of a young man utterly at home in his world. That sense of ease was apparent even when Professor Tate popped a surprise oral exam on his 1970 literature class, a scene he recalled recently as he sat in his book-lined living room, looking through bifocals at Romney's old report card.
"I went down the line from right to left asking the question. The first one said, 'I can't do it,' and the next one, 'I don't know it,' and the next one the same. And then I said, 'Okay, now you Brother Romney.' And he said, 'Okay, Brother Tate. You've humbled us. Now ask us a question we can answer.'ג[#x20ac][#x160]"

The 'hunting ground'
In a commencement address not long before Romney arrived at Brigham Young, Ernest L. Wilkinson, the university's president, declared that the obtaining of a spouse was "more important than the obtaining of a degree." He called his campus "the happiest hunting ground in the world." The message had a special meaning for Romney. He was drawn to BYU not only to get closer to his church but also to seal the deal with his high school sweetheart and persuade her to marry him.
When he left high school in suburban Detroit and went to Stanford, the notion of finishing his college career at the Mormon school in Utah was out of the question. "The one place I will not go is BYU!" he told his father, as George Romney later recounted the scene. But an unforeseen challenge to Mitt's relationship with his longtime girlfriend, Ann Davies, changed his perspective. Suddenly, BYU was the one place he had to be.
Ann, a few years behind him in school, had enrolled at Brigham Young in 1967. Romney by then had left Stanford after his first year to perform missionary work in France. His father, then the Michigan governor, had played a key role in all of this, personally baptizing Ann and her brother into the fold of the Mormon Church. Ann started her freshman year in Provo in 1967 while Mitt was off knocking on doors and seeking converts as a missionary, a task that earned him a draft deferment. Early the next year, Ann came to France for a semester abroad. The couple saw each other rarely and only under strict supervision. One of the church apostles, Howard W. Hunter, later church president, carried a message of greeting from Mitt to Ann in Grenoble, according to Donlu Thayer, who studied with Ann at the time.
Soon after Ann returned to the Brigham Young campus, Romney was shaken by successive traumas. In the summer, a speeding car driven by a French priest crashed into a packed Citroen DS driven by Romney, injuring the mission president, Duane Anderson, and killing Anderson's wife, Leola, who was seated between the two men.
"We have just learned that President and Sister H. Duane Anderson of the French Mission were involved in a serious head-on collision on the evening of Monday, June 17th," read the Progress French East Mission report on June 15, 1968. "Sister Anderson passed away within hours of the accident and President Anderson was seriously injured with broken ribs and a broken wrist. Other passengers in the car were injured, apparently not too seriously."
In fact, Romney was seriously injured, suffering head injuries and a fractured arm, and authorities at the scene first thought he was dead. But he recovered quickly, only to receive another emotional blow: one of the dreaded Dear John letters that papered the walls of Mormon missions around the world arrived with his name on it. Ann wrote to him that back at BYU she had started dating Kim S. Cameron, a student body vice president who would be voted the school's "most preferred man."
"We liked each other," said Cameron, who took Ann tubing in the mountains and to movies, dances and jazz shows.
But at BYU, such young women were often waiting for returning beaus, a circumstance so common that the phrase "she has a missionary" became a campus colloquialism. Less common was for the missionary in question to be the son of the most famous Mormon politician in the United States.
Cameron said Romney, even in absentia, loomed so large as to doom the relationship: "I mean, look, if you have a choice to pick either Mitt Romney or Kim Cameron, who are you going to pick? I mean, 99 out of a hundred, no contest."
But in France, Romney took the news hard. Friends described him as being "useless" and "near tears." He pressed intensely for reconciliation through a series of urgent letters. When he finally won Ann back, he agreed to her request that he join her in Provo for at least one semester. "Well, I'll go for one, then we'll both go to Stanford," Mitt responded, according to his father. He got there in February 1969, and the couple stayed in Utah. As the elder Romney later explained at a devotional address to the student body in 1970, when Ann and Mitt were there together, "Now he is just like the rest of you brainwashed students - he thinks BYU is the best university in the country." By then, the couple had married and moved into a shabby, $62-a-month basement apartment, with cracked tiles in the kitchen floor.
Dane McBride, Romney's friend and former missionary companion, was also newly married and rented upstairs in the three-story brick building close to campus. He would come down with his wife for spontaneous spaghetti dinners. The men would reprise jovial songs from their missionary days. The Romneys' first son, Taggart, was brought home to that apartment and stayed in a crib at the foot of their bed.
"I remember Mitt explaining to me the benefits of married life," said Clayton F. Foulger, a close friend who water-skied with Romney on Lake Utah and still spends summers at the family vacation home on Lake Winnipesaukee in New Hampshire. "He didn't have to explain a lot. It was sort of self-evident. But he was appreciative of it, I'll tell you."
The benefits of undergraduate matrimony are still promoted on campus. One recent afternoon in the Wilkinson Center, named for the late college president, stacks of Bridal Guide magazine stood under posters advertising a "Premarital Workshop." ("The proposal went well . . . Now what?")

A changing campus
BYU observes an honor code, a list of policies requiring students to live a chaste and virtuous life; use clean language; abstain from alcoholic beverages, tobacco, tea and coffee; participate regularly in church services; and observe dress and grooming standards. The school's honor code burst into the national news this past spring when a star basketball player, Brandon Davies, was suspended shortly before the NCAA tournament for having sex with his girlfriend.
In the era of Mitt Romney, the honor code was only one aspect of a conservative ethos enforced by President Wilkinson.
After an unsuccessful bid for the U.S. Senate in 1964, the hard-line anti-communist returned to the university, where some students and teachers quipped about his fictitious memoir "Mein Campus." Wilkinson, along with Willard Cleon Skousen, a former Salt Lake City police chief, John Birch Society booster and professor of religion at BYU, began running student spy rings targeting teachers and activist students.
In commencement addresses, Wilkinson, known for performing 100 push-ups at halftime of school basketball games, spoke out against birth control and "the social evils of today, such as beatniks, hippies, drug addicts, free-lovers, college rioters and others who would completely remove cleanliness, morality and all other Christian virtues from our civilization." He said student radicals should have "their citizenship revoked."
A strong conservative streak also ran through the classrooms, though some professors in the English department did their best to avoid Wilkinson and give their students a broader education. Reading lists in Romney's major addressed the ideas of the civil rights movement. Faulkner replaced Hemingway on some syllabi. Richard Cracroft, a professor who went on to chair the English department, said he and others found ways to teach controversial novels such as "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and "The Catcher in the Rye," though some established works also caused them headaches.
"These people would go right to the first presidency of the church," he said, referring to the church's highest governing body, "and say, 'Cracroft is teaching this play by Shakespeare, and it is filthy.'ג[#x20ac][#x160]"
But the campus was changing. More liberal students pored over their copies of Dialogue, a new journal of Mormon thought, and attended campus debates between hard-line and progressive religion professors at the Joseph Smith auditorium. The school paper, the Daily Universe, published letters of protest about the war.
In 1970, students elected a liberal named Brian Walton as their president despite the administration's attempts to nullify the results.
"It was an unbelievably conservative place," said Walton, who later left the church and became a chief negotiator for the Screen Writers Guild in Los Angeles. "You wouldn't believe the things some people were saying - complaining about the civil rights laws, that it would take away their rights."
Jon Ferguson, Walton's vice president, also ultimately left the church. He later wrote several novels, including "The Missionary," about a young Mormon in France who loses his faith. "When we did all this stuff on Vietnam, it was like the first turmoil BYU had had," Ferguson said. "BYU has never had so much excitement."
Walton and Ferguson also sought to allay anger over the church doctrine barring black priests by meeting with black student unions around the country.
Romney navigated a vastly different world. "You didn't think too much of people who were going out to try and demonstrate to persuade the brethren," said his friend McBride, who noted that only a revelation from the church president could change the doctrine. "It's not something [Mitt] would have done. From a church and priesthood leadership perspective, it would be unseemly as well as useless."
When Romney's old school, Stanford, announced at the end of 1969 that it would boycott athletic competitions with BYU, Romney was incensed.
"I remember sitting in a football stadium with Mitt, he and Ann were sitting next to me, and I do remember Mitt being really angry with Stanford," said Cameron, Ann's onetime suitor. "He felt like it was, A, naive, and, B, sort of a bigoted, narrow-minded perspective."
During Romney's junior year, Wilkinson issued a flier titled "Men of BYU - A Message from the President," encouraging participation in the Army Reserve. Walton, Ferguson and others responded at a special ceremony with 500 copies of "An Important Message to the Men of BYU," which urged alternatives to military service. When a copy reached Wilkinson on the stage in the field house, he shook with rage.
"It was a compilation of quotes from the Bible, the Book of Mormon and presidents and high-ranking officials in the Mormon Church about the horrors and evils of war and warfare," said Terrell Hunt, one of the pamphlet's authors and one of the few politically liberal members in Romney's university booster organization, the Cougar Club. "It would never occur to us to ask Mitt Romney to sign that thing."
That sort of thing, in fact, was one of the reasons Romney felt no desire to return to Stanford, where as a freshman he had once waved a "Speak Out, Don't Sit In" sign at protesters. He had thought BYU would be an escape from all of that.
"Let's face it," McBride said. "At Stanford and Berkeley, self-respecting college students were taking over the president's office and ransacking it."

Romney and ritual
Romney's aversion to antiestablishment activity, his friends said, was rooted in his religion, specifically Joseph Smith's 12th Article of Faith: "We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates, in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law." This was "not just a code of conduct," Clayton Foulger said. "It really is belief, and everything sort of arises from that."
Religion was a major dimension of Romney's life at BYU, as it has been since. The Mormon Church is broken up into geographical jurisdictions called "stakes," which comprise congregations called "wards." In Provo, Romney answered a church calling to be one of two counselors to a lay bishop in his student ward.
At that time, Provo had no Mormon temple, a sacred space within which the faith's most holy rituals, including marriage sealings, endowments and proxy baptisms for the dead, could be performed. Mitt and Ann had been married for eternity in the Salt Lake Temple, the towering quartz monzonite landmark in Temple Square. As students in possession of a "temple recommend," a church-issued stamp of good standing, they traveled the hour north from Provo to Salt Lake several times with the McBrides to perform church rituals, including baptisms of the dead.
"It was usually for just regular temple work," McBride said, "doing the proxy work for someone who is deceased."
Mormons believe that baptism is an essential right of passage to salvation, that it was performed on the dead in the time of the apostle Paul, and that Smith restored the practice after millenniums of apostasy. They hold that the ritual offers a second chance to accept Christ in the afterlife for those who died before the restoration of the Mormon Church, as well as for those who had failed to receive Mormon baptism since the church's establishment.
At the temple, the Romneys would enter a special room where a proxy, clad in white robes, waded into a large baptismal font resting on the backs of 12 sculpted oxen. The proxy then was vicariously baptized in the name of deceased people - often, but not always, relatives. (Ann's father, Edward R. Davies, a lifelong nonbeliever, received the rite a year after his death.)
Romney's involvement in the church extended beyond rituals and into the good works central to a religion forged by pioneers. He helped lead a church-run effort to clean up the Provo River and impressed his fellow students as a gifted speaker. One morning at the Provo Tabernacle, the presiding church authority announced that Romney would give some remarks after an opening prayer and song. Yet Romney was nowhere to be seen.
"I thought, 'Oh my gosh.' Here Mitt is, a real straight shooter, and he was going to be hugely embarrassed," said Tristan Pico, a friend of Romney's and a Cougar Club member. Pico had bumped into the Romneys at the movies the night before for a showing of "The Arrangement," a poorly received melodrama about a philandering ad man who gets into a car crash, and he wondered if Romney had slept late.
The couple arrived soon after, and Romney's head jerked to attention when someone whispered in his ear that his name had been called. He calmly walked to the front of the congregation and delivered a sermon based on the life lessons he had gleaned from the movie. "One of which was that one had to know who they were," Pico said, "and have the ability to act on that throughout their life and be consistent and good."

Eye toward success
Along with finding spouses and affirming faith, the BYU experience was also meant to emphasize making a living, professional success, as a means of strengthening the Mormon family. Romney's father, before entering politics, had made a fortune turning around American Motors Corp. with the Rambler, and now the son obsessed over how he would make his own entrepreneurial mark.
"I remember him saying, 'Golly, Dane, you're so lucky,'ג[#x20ac][#x160]" said McBride, then a pre-med student. "ג[#x20ac][#x160]'I don't have a clue what I'm going to be doing, you know? I don't know how I'm going to make a living for my family.'ג[#x20ac][#x160]"
But during his first summer break from BYU, Romney had an idea. He had convinced a corporation called Edcor that he could make it a bundle selling its new cordless microphones around the Michigan area. He and his new wife returned from Utah to the home of her parents in Bloomfield Hills. There, Romney called on former mission companions from his days in France and sent them out to knock on doors to sell microphones in the same way they had their church. Though the young men expected a windfall of about $10,000 each in commissions, Romney ended up making a few thousand dollars while his former missionary friends fared worse, relying on Ann's mother for meals of pancakes or lasagna, according to McBride.
When Romney returned to campus, his financial acumen sharpened, to the benefit of the school.
In 1970, Romney joined the Cougar Club, the president of which was Kim Cameron, his former competitor for Ann's affections. Cameron said there was "no tension" when he helped interview Romney for entrance into the club and that he found the underclassman remarkably impressive.
"We set a goal of a million dollars," said Cameron, who recalled Romney helping to successfully appeal to David Haight, the school's administrator and grandfather of future Utah governor Jon Huntsman, for the names of potential donors among wealthy alumni. They eventually reached their goal.
"I remember the first time I rushed Cougar Club I didn't get in, which of course was devastating," said Merril Dayton, now a doctor in Buffalo. "When I did get in, they said, 'Did you know that Governor Romney has a son in Cougar Club?' I said, 'No, I didn't. What's his name?' And they said, 'Mitt Romney. In fact, he's running for president of Cougar Club.'ג[#x20ac][#x160]"
Romney's fellow "Cougar Men" rewarded his innovation with the club's presidency.
On Page 379 in the 1971 school yearbook, Romney, wearing blazer, tie and slacks, is identified as club president as he kneels with other members in front of a pond on a farm outside Provo. The opposite page reads: "What student group would accept the challenge to raise $100,000 in twelve months' time? Cougar Club did without hesitation."
Romney gained a reputation for decisively presiding over meetings in the old alumni house and applying a bolder vision of the club. In addition to the traditional sale of chrysanthemums for homecoming and pushing records of BYU fight songs and tickets to football games, Romney "did things in Cougar Club that had never been done before," according to Clint Hunter, a junior member of the club. "Mitt had much grander concepts of how you raise money."
He invited speakers to address the club, including Stephen Covey, a BYU professor who later became famous for writing "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People," and followed some of their advice by masterminding a high-octane fundraising drive.
"He proposed, 'Why don't we leave this school that we love so much a real legacy?'ג[#x20ac][#x160]" McBride said. "Some of the guys said, 'Mitt, you can only have only so many luaus a year, you know.' He said, 'What if we can get the school administration to share with us the contact information of everybody who has ever matriculated through the school.' And we set up phone banks and got the students to make these calls as volunteers."
Romney also worked out a deal with a local car dealership so that the Cougar Men, along with their wives or girlfriends, would pick up prospective donors in new, polished cars for a spring day of activities and presentations. When rival universities, furious about the Mormon Church's ban on blacks in the priesthood, caused disturbances at games, the Cougar Club felt under siege, according to McBride.
"Can you believe these guys doing this to us?" was how Romney and other club leaders felt, McBride said. Their response was to "raise more money for the school."
In October 1997, Romney, then managing director at Bain Capital, returned to campus as the College of Humanities' honored alumnus and gave a lecture called "Defying the Experts: How to Win in the Games of Life." As part of the program, Kristine Hansen, a former classmate and now an English professor at the university, presented Romney with membership to the school's Phi Kappa Phi society of academic achievers. He graciously received the honor, and then joked that the society had invited him to join as a student but that he declined "because it cost money," recalled Hansen, who had declined the honor herself as a student because she could not afford the nominal fee. "I thought, 'You could have paid that,'ג[#x20ac][#x160]" she said. "To me, it wasn't that funny."

'Mitt's here'
As a student in the clubby Honors Program, a version of a great-books liberal arts college within the wider university, Romney made a point of greeting teachers in the hall. C. Terry Warner, a Yale-trained philosophy professor who ran the program, was so close to Romney that the two played the market together and took a bath on some bad stocks.
Besides acting as Romney's financial adviser, Warner taught him to seek echoes of major philosophical insights in the church's own intellectual and religious tradition and to feel free to express those connections. "It's like the censorship is removed and you can enunciate the strengths you've always believed in," Warner said.
Romney's seriousness as a student impressed many classmates, who considered him exceptionally well prepared and emblematic of the ambitious pre-law and business students in the English department. But his teacher's pet persona rubbed some students the wrong way.
Terrell Hunt, the Cougar Man whose antiestablishment posture included the sporting of a controversial mustache, took Warner's philosophy class with Romney. When Warner sharply critiqued Hunt's 100-page final paper, the student responded with a letter asking, "Is the analysis on comments you made on my paper typical to the comments you made on other students in the class? In fact, I'd like to see your comments on Mitt Romney's paper."
In a botany class, Hansen recalled Romney as someone "full of himself" and "very aware of who he was. He realized he was good looking and the son of a famous man. When he walked into the class, it was like, 'Mitt's here.'ג[#x20ac][#x160]"
And yet Romney apparently had a more literary side, discordant with his present strictly business image and recent reading lists. (He has cited "Battleship Earth" as a favorite.) The chairman of the English department at the time, Marshall Craig, liked telling a story about how Romney, when approaching graduation, came to him seeking advice on pursuing a doctorate in English literature.
"You can afford to read all the books you'd like, but why would you get a PhD and starve?" Craig often recounted telling Romney, according to John Tanner, an English professor and currently the head of the Sao Paulo South Mission in Brazil. "You should get an MBA."
On May 5, 1971, the university held its Honors Program Banquet at the Wilkinson Center. After listening to a Mozart quartet, the audience paid tribute to the 11 students, including Romney, who performed well enough on rigorous exit interviews to receive highest honors. The banquet program noted that Romney, who earned cum laude recognition, would attend Harvard to pursue an MBA. At graduation in August, he again followed in his competitor Cameron's footsteps and delivered the "Expression from Graduates" address.
More than 40 years after Romney left Brigham Young, on the eve of the South Carolina primary, McBride attended a Romney campaign event and caught the candidate's eye on a rope line. Romney wrote down a number and asked his college pal to give him a call late that night.
"Well, it looks like we're not going to do all that well tomorrow. But I want you to know that it means a whole lot to me that you're here," Romney said, according to McBride. The two old friends then reminisced about their days in Provo and in France. They recalled the parody songs they had written to raise morale for missionaries and the way they sang them to their newlywed wives in the tiny basement apartment in Provo.
We Elders of Angouleme are
Broke, hungry and no check from afar
Eating solely ravioli
Out of a mason jar
To the tune of "We Three Kings of Orient Are," Romney and his old friend rounded into the chorus:
Oh, woe, starving elders man the fight
To keep vultures out of sight
Will we make it or forsake it
To seek food in the street tonight?

A year later, Egyptian neighborhood waits for justice to arrive

BYLINE: Ben Hubbard

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A08

LENGTH: 1376 words

DATELINE: CAIRO

CAIRO - A year later, the neighbors still speak of those killed the night they attacked the police station: the young man shot in the neck while carrying off a wounded friend; the bodybuilder who took a bullet in the hip; the 15-year-old girl shot in the face while standing on her roof.
On that day, Jan. 28, 2011, the world was focused on Tahrir Square, the downtown center of the popular uprising that would end the 30-year rule of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. But in neighborhoods across Cairo, residents were targeting the local face of Mubarak's oppressive rule: the police station.
In the poor district of al-Zawiya al-Hamra that day, 1,000 protesters rallied in the shabby park in front of the station. Some threw rocks, then gas bombs, and the police opened fire, residents said. By morning, 45 residents and one police officer were dead, and smoke still rose from the torched station. 
On the anniversary of those deaths, "martyr" posters adorned neighborhood walls, and the lack of justice for the dead remained an open wound. Residents complain that no police have been punished, and it is unlikely that those facing trial will be convicted.
In a wider sense, their feelings one year after the uprising reflect those in many long-neglected parts of Egypt: that the revolution was necessary but its benefits have barely reached the common person.
"We feel that we are living among free people, but wehaven't seen anything concrete yet," said Omar Ali, 46, who struggles to pay rent on a windowless flat by fixing computers.
Like many here, he is optimistic that the Muslim Brotherhood, whose political party holds nearly half the seats in the newly elected People's Assembly, will serve the neighborhood well. The Brotherhood won heavily in al-Zawiya al-Hamra.
"They do what is right, they won't oppress us, and they fear God," Omar said.

Paying for justice
Al-Zawiya al-Hamra, a crowded grid of squat apartment blocks amid smoggy boulevards, typifies the decades of governmental neglect that helped fuel the uprising. It sprouted on agricultural land in northern Cairo in the 1960s when the government built blocks of drab, low-cost public housing and has since swelled to more than 300,000 people packed into just over a square mile.
Many streets are trash-strewn and unpaved, and public school classes often have 70 students. The government shuttered the local hospital for years for "maintenance," and even now it often turns patients away, residents said.
Unemployment rates are high. At night young men pass the time around wood fires on street corners. Crooks and drug dealers have long operated in the area.
Under Mubarak, the police station was the government's most prominent local face, and it was often an ugly one. Officers beefed up meager salaries by extorting locals and taking cash from drug dealers to look the other way, said Sayeed al-Sayid, a local lawyer. They often ignored poor residents' calls for help.
"Those with money would enter the station and leave right away," knowing they would be helped, al-Sayid said. "They would pay for police service."
The resulting frustration was common throughout Egypt, and protesters across the country attacked police stations, torching 99 in a few days. In many cases, police shot and killed protesters before fleeing.
The gunfire in al-Zawiya al-Hamra started about 7 p.m. and lasted until midnight, said Mohammed al-Sayid, a butcher. Police fired on men near the station but also hit people more than 200 yards away, he said, recalling residents collapsing on the sidewalk.
"It was like faucets of blood," he said.
Bullet holes mar the walls of his shop. One bullet pierced the metal pan he uses to weigh meat. Others whizzed into the bedrooms of his neighbors. One bullet passed through the sleeve of a woman upstairs before lodging in her kitchen wall.
Lamie Suleiman, 63, said his son Girgis was shot in the neck while carrying a wounded man. Fathallah Ibrahim, 61, said his son Mohammed, a weight lifter, was heading to his metal workshop behind the station when he was shot in the hip. Both died soon after.
Samira Qilada was watching from her roof with her daughter Mariam, 15, when the girl collapsed.
"I went to see what happened and saw a river of blood from her face," Qilada said. A bullet shattered the girl's jaw. She died the next day.
Relatives of the dead have compiled a list of 45 people killed that night.
Anwar Awad, an officer in the station, said police were first told to fire in the air, then to protect the station.
"After people started attacking the station, [the police] were told that anyone getting close to the station or throwing stuff or firing at the station should be shot," he said. One officer, Abdullah Mahmoud, was shot dead in the chaos, he said.
Awad blamed the attack on criminals trying to settle scores with the police - an argument police have used, sometimes successfully, in court cases. Awad has been accused in one such case, but says he wasn't present at the time.
More than a dozen cases against officers in al-Zawiya al-Hamra station are in the courts, but many doubt they'll end in murder convictions.
Prosecutors didn't do forensic analysis on the bullets that killed people to match them with rifles, said Mohammed Mahmoud, a lawyer with the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information who has worked on police station cases around Cairo. Accused officers have not been detained, leaving them free to pressure families to drop their cases, he said.
One officer from al-Zawiya al-Hamra, Mohammed al-Sunni, was convicted in absentia and sentenced to death. After 11 months in hiding, he turned himself in last month, saying he could prove his innocence. He will be retried.

Neighborhood neglect
Residents point to small ways life has changed since Mubarak stepped down last February. Some said police no longer stop them to demand cash. Others said illegal building has boomed, since no one checks for permits, which used to require heavy bribes to obtain.
But with the near absence of police, crime has risen.
"Before the revolution, if someone got robbed, he might get his things back. Now, he won't," said William Bishay, 57. "Before, people would sell drugs in secret. Now they do it openly."
Residents strongly backed  Brotherhood candidates in the elections, many saying their religious credentials will keep them honest. Some reasoned that as Egypt's most organized political and social organization, the Brotherhood would govern effectively.
The group's lawmakers in al-Zawiya al-Hamra say they have plans to improve things.
Kamal Mahdy, a new Brotherhood lawmaker who has lived in the neighborhood for more than 20 years, said he has contacted neighborhood heads and the police station and is planning "field visits" to discuss cooperation on local issues.
"We'll try to bring everyone in and build justice between them all," he said.
Restoring security is the biggest challenge, he said, because of bad blood between residents and police. He said some security officials have also been reluctant to work with the Brotherhood, which was outlawed before the uprising.
Mahdy said supervision over the local budget will make sure it is spent well.
"We won't let anyone shortchange us," he said. "As long as there is a local budget, we need to make sure it is actually spent on priorities. It doesn't make sense that we have a place where the sewers break every day."
And for justice in the killings a year ago, Mahdy said the new parliament would pressure the interior and justice ministers for speedier trials.
In al-Zawiya al-Hamra, the relatives of the dead keep in touch. Many give photos of their "martyrs" to people they meet and carry coroner's reports with them to read aloud to anyone who will listen.
"It's like we were living in a white world, and now it has all turned black," said Makram Nazir, father of Mariam, the girl shot on her roof. He sat in the family's modest living room under a shrine of photos of the smiling teen, who was to be engaged this year.
"She was the laughter in this apartment, and now that has been taken from us," Nazir said.
Nazir said Egypt's revolution won't feel complete unless there is retribution.
"Those who kill should be killed," he said. "All we want is for the people who killed to be punished."

What did Pakistan know about bin Laden?

BYLINE: David Ignatius

SECTION: EDITORIAL COPY; Pg. A23

LENGTH: 765 words

With Pakistan's civilian government and judiciary showing renewed signs of life, it's time for them to ask the question the country has been avoiding for nine months: How did Osama bin Laden, the world's leading terrorist, hide out in a military garrison city near Islamabad without anyone knowing?
To ask this question is not to accuse the Pakistani military or intelligence service of wrongdoing. So far, no "smoking gun" has emerged. But many puzzling issues surround bin Laden's stay in Abbottabad for six years. Nobody should want them answered more than Gen. Ashfaq Kayani, the chief of army staff, who would gain new credibility at home and abroad by allowing such a probe. 
Gen. Mike Hayden, the former CIA director, sums up a feeling that's widespread among both Americans and Pakistanis when he says: "Without being accusatory, I think it's certainly in Pakistan's interest to clear the air."
Implausible as it may sound, U.S. officials say that they don't have any evidence that Kayani or other top Pakistani officials knew of bin Laden's presence before the May 2 raid that killed the al-Qaeda leader. This assessment is based on the review of materials taken from bin Laden's compound, plus the reactions of Kayani and other officials the night of the raid.
What makes an investigation seem possible now is that the Pakistani government, often under the military's thumb, has been asserting its independence. The parliament has been examining how to "reset" the U.S.-Pakistan relationship; the Supreme Court has indicted Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani in a corruption scandal and, notably, has scolded the Inter-Services Intelligence directorate for its treatment of prisoners; and President Asif Ali Zardari has managed to stay in power despite perpetual rumors that the military wants him out.
To lead Pakistan out of its wilderness of mirrors, Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry should form a special commission to examine the loose ends of the bin Laden story. Based on conversations with U.S., Pakistani and other officials, here are some questions that deserve answers:
l How did bin Laden come to Abbottabad in 2005, and what did Pakistani officials know about his whereabouts? Kayani was ISI chief at that time, but the dominant figure was President Pervez Musharraf, the former army chief. The commander of the military academy at Abbottabad starting in 2006 was Lt. Gen. Nadeem Taj,  who succeeded Kayani as head of the ISI in 2007.
l Who owned the compound in 2005, and how was it readied for the new guest? I'm told that the original property records have disappeared, so the answers here are murky. But one intelligence source tells me that the architect who worked on the compound was regularly employed by the ISI; the architect reportedly was told only that a "highly placed VIP" was coming.
l What about the recent claim by former general Ziauddin Butt, former chief of the ISI, that the Abbottabad safe house was used by the Intelligence Bureau, another Pakistani spy agency? According to a December report in the Pakistani press, Butt said that bin Laden's stay at Abbottabad was arranged by Brig. Gen. Ijaz Shah, head of the bureau from 2004 to 2008, on Musharraf's orders. A Pakistani journalist named Arif Jamal recently published an articledescribing Shah as bin Laden's "handler."
l Whom did bin Laden contact while he was at Abbottabad? Though materials taken from the compound don't show direct links with top Pakistani officials, U.S. analysts have found evidence that the al-Qaeda chief communicated with Mohammad Omar, leader of the Taliban, and with the Kashmiri militant group Lashkar-i-Taiba. The ISI is thought to monitor both groups closely; how did the messages slip through the net?
l What about the rumor that bin Laden was suffering from kidney failure and required dialysis? This canard was repeated for years, notably by Musharraf. CIA analysts were always dubious, and no dialysis machines were found at Abbottabad. So was this a deliberate piece of misinformation? And what about bin Laden's claim in November 2001 to Pakistani journalist Hamid Mir that he had nuclear and chemical weapons? Was that a Pakistan-facilitated attempt to promote what bin Laden called his "deterrent" against a U.S. reprisal attack?
The list of unanswered questions goes on. But this sampling is enough to raise anyone's eyebrows. For Pakistan to step foursquare into the future, and put this dreadful decade of lies and suspicion behind, it's time for an official inquiry - not to please America, but to ensure the dignity of Pakistan.

'Watergate': Filling in the personal gaps

BYLINE: Kevin Nance

SECTION: STYLE; Pg. T12

LENGTH: 1446 words

On Election Day in 1960, Thomas Mallon, who had just turned 9, proudly wore a Nixon/Lodge button - "Experience Counts!" - and was devastated when the presidency went to John F. Kennedy. During RichardM. Nixon's re-bid for the White House in 1968, the 16-year-old Mallon experienced one of the greatest thrills of his life when he shook hands with the future president and first lady as they sat in an open car while campaigning on Long Island. Two years after that, as a freshman at Brown University, Mallon was still a Nixon man, voting against a student strike in response to the administration's bombing of Cambodia and the Kent State shootings.
"I was much more conservative than my peers, so I was all for Nixon," recalls Mallon, 60, now one of America's leading historical novelists and director of the creative writing program at George Washington University. "His Vietnamization plan for winding down the war I thought was reasonable. But I felt woefully tested by the Cambodian campaign, and as time went on, even before Watergate, he made it very hard to be a supporter. But I always felt an oddly intimate involvement with him, because he always intrigued me on a personal level. He was the central public figure of my life." 
It was destiny, then, that Mallon would eventually write "Watergate"(Pantheon Books, $26.95), his kaleidoscopic new novel about the epoch-defining political scandal that brought down the flawed hero of his youth.
The book, to be published Tuesday, puts fictional flesh on the bones of what we know about the gradual collapse of the Nixon administration after the bungled 1972 break-in at the Democratic National Committee offices in the Watergate complex. As a young man, Mallon watched with mounting dread as that debacle unfolded, and it haunts him still; a registered Republican to this day, he has a pang-producing view of the Watergate from his home in Foggy Bottom.
For the author - a former National Endowment for the Humanities executive whose seven previous novels include "Fellow Travelers" (2007), about a male couple in Washington during the McCarthy era, and "Dewey Defeats Truman" (1996) - fictionalizing the Watergate scandal involved several added levels of risk, including the fact that it's still relatively recent. A number of its major and minor players are still alive. (Mallon even knew the late Howard Hunt, with whom he struck up an acquaintance several years ago after they met at a party.)
"The further back in history you go, the less the ordinary reader knows about the period, and the more remote everything is emotionally and morally, so as a novelist you can't really do much damage," Mallon says. "But anybody who's 50 or older can't be without an opinion of Richard Nixon."
Still, in "Watergate"- dedicated to the critic and essayist Christopher Hitchens, who before his death in December pronounced the book "a splendid evocation of Washington"- the gang's all here: Hunt and G. Gordon Liddy, Chuck Colson and Jeb Magruder, H.R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman, John Dean and Elliot Richardson, John and Martha Mitchell. Several figures associated with this newspaper, including Bob Woodward, Carl Bernstein, Katharine Graham and Ben Bradlee, make brief but memorable (and sometimes scabrous) appearances.
Mallon also elevates some less-remembered figures to fresh prominence, including Fred LaRue, deputy director of the Committee to Re-Elect the President; the D.C. dowager Alice Roosevelt Longworth, daughter of Theodore Roosevelt and widow of a former speaker of the House; and Rose Mary Woods, Nixon's executive assistant.
As he explains in a postscript, Mallon operates along "the always sliding scale of historical fiction," which in his case means departing as minimally as possible from the historical record. When the author does imagine conversations or orchestrates plot developments, he never does so "counterfactually," as he puts it, which is to say that such inventions must be generally in harmony with what's known to be true. Still, he reserves the right to make things up.
"Nouns trump adjectives, and in the phrase 'historical fiction,' it's important to remember which is which," Mallon says. "Sometimes people tell me, 'Oh, I learned so much history from your book,' and I always think, 'Oh, be careful.' I tend to be more on the conservative side of historical fiction, but I don't ever really abandon my license as a creative artist. The imaginative labors of the book were, in the end, more intensive than the research."
Mallon's juicy portrait of Woods - who claimed to be inadvertently responsible for the infamous 181 / 2-minute gap in a White House audiotape - best illustrates the author's strategy of filling in gaps: applying complex layers of personality, motivation and foible to the stick figures from the headlines. An intensely private figure in life (she died in 2005), Woods is reanimated in "Watergate" as fiercely protective and even possessive of the man she had served for 17 years before he won the White House.
She's also bitterly, at times wickedly, resentful of many of the president's men. These include Haldeman ("HRH," as she and her undersecretaries mock the chief of staff behind his back), who had usurped what she regarded as her rightful place as the president's principal gatekeeper, and "all these good-looking dumb-bunnies like Magruder," who provided Nixon "with a whole new cloud of insulation, like those little Styrofoam peanuts Rose's mail-order knickknacks came packed in." (Magruder is also the butt of several other mean-spirited jokes. "Jeb will just be mad he wasn't out on the Sequoia with you," Colson tells Nixon at one point. "He's like a doll without batteries when he's not wearing his White House cuff links.")
Pat Nixon, that most wan and withdrawn of presidential wives in the national memory, is similarly filled out by the author, who posits her as a vivacious, even outgoing woman whose seeming introversion in public was a self-protective mask. "Although she was a nervous person, a chain smoker who didn't like politics, there's evidence in the historical record that she was a warmer person than we tend to think," Mallon says. "I think it's also likely that the Nixon marriage was warmer than is often thought." Even so, his Pat Nixon harbors a secret passion; in a rare and risky side trip from the aforementioned historical record, the author gives her an extramarital affair.
Crouching at the center of the novel's intricate web is Nixon himself, who receives a carefully nuanced treatment as a man whose darkest impulses were rendered all the more tragic by his capacity for greatness.
"There's a story about Nixon that as a child he got a briefcase for Christmas and was happy about it," Mallon says with a hint of wonder. "There was always that striver aspect of Nixon, and it never went away, even at the end. If he's going to be of any interest to a novelist, of course, it's not going to be as a pasteboard villain who twirls his mustache and ties his victim to the railroad tracks. He's a combination of positive and negative qualities - the good and the bad and the coexistence of those things."
In one of the book's most poignant (and obviously fictional) moments, Mallon shows Nixon staring out of a window at Bethesda Naval Hospital and deciding, finally, that he lacks the courage to destroy the incriminating White House tapes because doing so might trigger impeachment proceedings. "With a surprising sadness," Mallon writes, "he realized that he also lacked, at least for now, whatever strange bravery it would take to leap from the window."
"One of the seeds of this book is that I've long wanted Tom to write something about Richard Nixon," says Dan Frank, Mallon's longtime editor at Pantheon. "We share a perspective of Nixon as a tragic figure, a man with a great number of faults but in many ways a brilliant politician, foresighted in both domestic and foreign policy. I think Tom saw this as an opportunity to move beyond partisan views of Nixon and try to tell the story from a more humanistic perspective, rather than from ideological bias or whether it was Democrats pursuing Republicans or whatever."
Of course, as Mallon points out, he's not the first writer to present Nixon as a complicated figure. "I doubt the reaction to the book will break down very clearly along party lines," he says. "On the other hand, obviously the true believers in Nixon are not going to be happy."

Alexandria man arrested in alleged bomb plot

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A01

LENGTH: 288 words

Federal authorities on Friday arrested a 29-year-old Moroccan man in an alleged plot to carry out a suicide bombing at the U.S. Capitol Building, the latest in a series of terrorism-related arrests resulting from undercover sting operations.  
For more than a year, Amine El Khalifi, of Alexandria, considered attacking targets including a synagogue, U.S. military facility  and a Washington restaurant frequented by military officials, authorities said. He settled on the Capitol, they said, and when arrested a few blocks away on Friday, was carrying what he believed to be a loaded automatic weapon and a suicide vest ready for detonation.
The gun and vest were provided not by al Qaeda, as Khalifi had been told, but by undercover FBI agents who rendered them inoperable.
Khalifi, officials said, had been the subject of a lengthy investigation and never posed a public threat. Friday afternoon he made an initial court appearance in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, where he was charged with attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction against federal property. He faces life in prison if convicted.
In several recent terrorism sting operations, critics have accused federal investigators of provoking suspects and, in some cases, suggesting possible targets or tactics.
The Justice Department has defended its practices. Officials said Friday that Khalifi, who allegedly conducted surveillance on the Capitol and engaged in other methodical planning, was not an unwitting victim. 
Khalifi "allegedly believed he was working with al-Qaeda," said Neil H. MacBride, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. He "devised the plot, the targets and the methods on his own."

A law that gun-rights advocates should be fighting to keep

BYLINE: Douglas Weil

SECTION: EDITORIAL COPY; Pg. C04

LENGTH: 559 words

In July 1993, a Virginia law took effect limiting the number of handguns an individual could purchase to one gun every 30 days. Not to one gun a year, or one gun a lifetime - but one gun a month. The impact of this law on interstate gun trafficking was immediate, it was significant and it is impossible to refute. Prior to the law, Virginia gun dealers were the most important source of crime guns illegally trafficked along Interstate 95, also known as the "iron pipeline" from the Southeast to the states in the Northeast corridor.
The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) routinely traces the origin of crime guns from the location where they have been recovered by the police back to the firearms dealers who first sold the guns. In the 5 1 / 2-year period beginning in September 1989, 14,606 guns that were sold by dealers in one of the eight southeastern states were later recovered by the police  and traced to their origin by ATF. An analysis of the trace data that I conducted with my colleague Rebecca C. Knox revealed that the odds that any of these guns would be traced back to a Virginia gun dealer fell by a third after the one-gun-a-month law took effect. 
Our analysis, published in 1996 in the Journal of the American Medical Association, showed that the impact of the law on gun trafficking was even more dramatic along the iron pipeline. Specifically, the odds that a crime gun used in the Northeast would be traced to a gun dealer in Virginia fell by two-thirds.
Despite this, the Virginia General Assembly has voted to repeal the one-gun-a-month restriction, and Gov. Robert F. McDonnell has indicated that he will sign the legislation. Their logic appears to be that since exemptions to the law have been created (e.g., for law-enforcement officers and holders of concealed-carry permits), the state should exempt everyone. But there is simply no public health or public safety rationale for repealing the law.
The gun lobby is fond of saying that gun laws only burden law-abiding citizens - that criminals will always be able to get guns. The analysis of ATF's gun-trace data proves that proposition is not true. The Virginia law applies to retail gun sales, but the impact, both large and immediate, was on illegal gun trafficking. The law places virtually no burden on individuals who are legally entitled to purchase a handgun. It isn't a prohibition against the purchase or possession of firearms. It doesn't limit the number of guns an individual can own. It doesn't increase the time needed to complete a background check. The law burdens gun traffickers and the straw purchasers they hire to supply them with guns, and it makes it more difficult for the rare dirty gun dealer who is willing to look the other way when a single individual walks in to his store asking to buy five or 10 or even 20 or more inexpensive handguns to be sold on the street.
One-gun-a-month's fate is now in McDonnell's hands, and one hopes he will take an objective look at the impact of the law before acting. Rather than repealing this law, Virginia should be touting its success to encourage other states and ultimately the federal government to follow its lead and enact similar legislation.

GASOLINE

Prices may surge to record highs
Gasoline prices have never been higher this time of the year. At $3.53 a gallon, prices are already up 25 cents since Jan. 1. And experts say they could reach a record $4.25 a gallon by late April. 
"You're going to see a lot more staycations this year," said Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy and Economic Research. "When the price gets anywhere near $4, you really see people react."
The surge in gas prices follows an increase in the price of oil.
Oil around the world is priced differently. Brent crude from the North Sea is a proxy for the foreign oil that's imported by U.S. refineries and turned into gasoline and other fuels. Its price has risen 11 percent so far this year, to about $119 a barrel, because of tensions with Iran, a cold snap in Europe and rising demand from developing nations. West Texas Intermediate, used to price oil produced in the United States, is up 4 percent to about $103 a barrel. That's 19 percent higher than a year earlier.
Higher gas prices could hurt consumer spending and curtail the recent improvement in the U.S. economy.

Mercury veteransmark anniversary
Veterans of NASA's Project Mercury reunited Saturday to celebrate the 50th anniversary of John Glenn's orbital flight, visiting the old launch pad and meeting the famed astronaut himself.
The first American to orbit the Earth thanked the approximately 125 retired Mercury workers, now in their 70s and 80s, who gathered with their spouses at Kennedy Space Center to swap stories and pose for pictures.
"We might have been the focal point of attention, but you were all the ones making the whole thing possible," Glenn told the crowd.
Glenn, 90, and Scott Carpenter, 86, the only other survivor of NASA's original Mercury 7 astronauts, spent nearly an hour being photographed with the retirees, posing in front of a black curtain with a model of a Mercury-Atlas rocket. 
Earlier in the afternoon, the Mercury brigade traveled by bus to Launch Complex 14. That's the pad from which Glenn rocketed away on Feb. 20, 1962.

Pastor's daughter shot in a church dies: Authorities say a pastor's daughter who was accidentally shot in the head in a Florida church has died. The Pinellas County Sheriff's Office says 20-year-old Hannah Kelley died Saturday at a hospital. An autopsy is pending. Kelley had been hospitalized since Feb. 12, when she was hit in the head by a bullet at her father's Grace Connection Church in St. Petersburg. Investigators have said Moises Zambrana was showing his gun in a small closet to another church member interested in buying a firearm. The gun went off, firing a bullet through a wall. The sheriff's office says detectives are still investigating the shooting. No charges have been filed.

Mystery over cases of winning detective

When Milton Norris  http://voices.washingtonpost.com/crime-scene/chief-cathy-l-lanier/dc-police-celebrate-annual-awa-1.html-URL-http://voices.washingtonpost.com/crime-scene/chief-cathy-l-lanier/dc-police-celebrate-annual-awa-1.html was nominated for D.C.  http://voices.washingtonpost.com/crime-scene/chief-cathy-l-lanier/dc-police-celebrate-annual-awa-1.html"                 title="voices.washingtonpost.com-URL-Homicide Detective of the Year in 2011, officials said it was because of his impeccable record of solving cases the year before - a closure rate of 300 percent to be exact.
Officials described the veteran detective as a "standout" in the homicide unit who had closed all of his 2010 cases. 
"During the year Detective Norris has repeatedly proven himself as a determined investigator who works tirelessly to bring closure to his cases as evidenced by solving and closing the most egregious of crimes, Homicide," says  http://mpdc.dc.gov/mpdc/LIB/mpdc/about/heroes/awards/awardsprog_10.pdf"                 title="mpdc.dc.gov-URL-the recommendation letter posted on the D.C. police Web site.
Norris won the award. But a review of his homicide cases by The Washington Post found that he had only two cases for 2010 and that both remain open. One was the robbery and fatal shooting of John Edwards, 58, who was killed Aug. 5 in the 1300 block of Good Hope Road SE. In the other, Antonio Wade, 18, was shot Dec. 11 during a dispute in the 1400 block of Ridge Place SE. 
When questioned about his closure rate, Norris acknowledged that he hadn't solved either case and directed questions to the supervisors who nominated him.
"I'm probably the wrong person to be talking to," he said in an interview. "I don't know what they go by to determine it. I don't make the rules."
D.C. police officials said Norris received credit for closing several cases from other years.
Lt. Ozetta Posey, Norris's supervisor at the time, said it was her recommendation that led to his receiving the coveted award. 
"I was out on sick leave but called in and had the sergeant write it [the nomination letter] up," she said. "Every detective of the year for the last seven years has been under my supervision, including Milton Norris."
The winners are chosen by a committee that includes several assistant chiefs. 
From 2004 to 2010, Norris investigated 41 homicides and closed 24, a 58 percent closure rate, according to police records. About 10 of his cases ended in convictions, court records show. Three of his cases were closed without an arrest.
Norris received the award, which included a plaque, a medal and certificates signed by Chief Cathy L. Lanier and Mayor Vincent C. Gray, during the police department's  http://mpdc.dc.gov/mpdc/frames.asp?doc=/mpdc/LIB/mpdc/about/heroes/awards/awardsprog_10.pdf-URL-11th annual awards ceremony http://voices.washingtonpost.com/crime-scene/chief-cathy-l-lanier/dc-police-celebrate-annual-awa-1.html-URL-http://voices.washingtonpost.com/crime-scene/chief-cathy-l-lanier/dc-police-celebrate-annual-awa-1.html last February at Gallaudet University's Elstad Auditorium. Lanier presented the awards.
"It wasn't no shock to me," Norris said. "I've been doing police work for 23 years. I think I'm a rather good detective."
Lanier said officials considered "several factors" in bestowing the award on Norris, but she would not elaborate.
"We believe he was deserving of that award," she said in a written response.   
Norris, who was paid $136,514 in 2010, including more than $61,000 in overtime pay, said he knew his record wasn't what his supervisors claimed, but he didn't dispute them during the ceremony - or afterward.
"I had no idea they said that about me," Norris said. "It probably was a mistake."
Another veteran homicide detective, Anthony Patterson, said he also was nominated and thought he had a good chance of winning. "I had three cases and closed them all," Patterson said.

A RACE TO DEFINE RICK SANTORUM

BYLINE: Dan Balz

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A01

LENGTH: 2769 words

Republican presidential candidate Rick http://www.washingtonpost.com/rick-santorum-2012-presidential-candidate/gIQA61AHdO_topic.html-URL- Santorum  has  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/primary-tracker/-URL-won four states  and risen suddenly to challenge Mitt Romney as the http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/behind-the-numbers/post/rick-santorum-now-rivals-mitt-romney-in-popularity-poll-finds/2012/02/01/gIQAXmNhDR_blog.html-URL- leader in the national polls . Now he faces a new hurdle: defining himself positively before others rush to disqualify him.
Santorum presents himself as a committed and consistent conservative with blue-collar roots - just the kind of candidate Republicans need to energize the party's base and reach out to Reagan Democrats in a campaign against President Obama that could be decided in the nation's industrial heartland. 
Obama advisers and other Democrats see a Santorum whose record, writings and statements, particularly on social issues, will be used to portray him as far too conservative for many voters. His record, they say, could make Santorum anathema to suburban swing voters, especially women. That view is shared by some Republicans and independent analysts.
"They [Democrats] would brutalize him on social and cultural issues and present him as so far out of the mainstream as to be radical," said G. Terry Madonna, director of the  http://www.fandm.edu/politics-URL-Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Franklin & Marshall College  and a leading pollster in Pennsylvania. "The analogy would be Barry Goldwater" - the 1964 GOP nominee who suffered a landslide defeat.
Santorum's advisers recognize that he has entered a new phase in  http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/santorum-enters-presidential-race/2011/06/06/AGvY7HKH_gallery.html-URL-his campaign , and they see the obstacles ahead. They argue that a full and fair reading of his record reveals a more attractive profile of the former senator. But they acknowledge it is up to Santorum and his campaign to explain that record and allay concerns about his ability to run competitively in November.
"There will be people - Romney and the Democrats - who will try to distort these things," said John Brabender, Santorum's longtime political adviser. "It's the responsibility of our campaign to show what the senator's record really is. We are confident that once that happens, people will understand that the senator is extremely reasonable."
The first tests will come over the next 10 days, as Santorum attempts to leverage his new prominence against Romney in primaries in Arizona and especially  http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/election-2012/post/today-on-the-trail-romney-santorum-face-off-in-michigan/2012/02/15/gIQA1iKeGR_blog.html-URL-Michigan , and then on Super Tuesday, March 6.
Romney and the super PAC backing his campaign have  http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/in-first-direct-criticism-of-santorum-in-weeks-romney-says-rival-isnt-a-fiscal-conservative/2012/02/17/gIQA1JjQKR_story.html-URL-begun to attack Santorum  - though not for being too conservative. That may be too risky for a candidate  http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mitt-romney-reframes-himself-as-a-severely-conservative-governor/2012/02/14/gIQAaMiqHR_story.html-URL-whose conservative credentials are already considered suspect  by many on the right.
Instead, they say Santorum strayed from his conservative moorings whenever it was politically convenient to do so. He backed earmarks for projects in his state and district. He voted, as did many in his party, to raise the debt ceiling repeatedly. He backed higher spending to pay for prescription drug benefits under Medicare. He was cozy with labor unions, an important constituency in Pennsylvania.
Those issues likely will be prime topics at Wednesday's  http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/02/15/submit-your-questions-for-the-next-cnn-debate-in-arizona/-URL-GOP debate in Arizona , and Santorum advisers say they are eager to take on Romney and his attacks in that forum. Romney, they say, is the GOP candidate with questionable conservative credentials, and they are determined to win that definitional battle.

Santorum's stances
More problematic are the issues that could hurt Santorum in a general election. Like most Republicans, he opposes abortion, but his stance is more restrictive than many. He opposes abortions in all cases except when the life of the mother is in danger. He would not make exceptions for rape and incest. Santorum also said he would favor legislation that would allow prosecution of doctors who perform abortions, a position he reaffirmed Saturday in Ohio.
The recent White House  http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/the-white-houses-convenient-contraception-controversy/2012/02/09/gIQAeOfm2Q_blog.html-URL-missteps on contraception  gave Santorum, a devout Roman Catholic, an opportunity to attack the administration on grounds of religious freedom. But  http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/election-2012/post/rick-santorum-and-women-a-history-of-his-comments/2012/02/10/gIQAHbNP4Q_blog.html-URL-broader issues of women's rights  present potential problems for his candidacy.
Though he has voted in favor of contraception, he has  http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/rick-santorum-is-surging-but-faces-intensifying-scrutiny-over-contraception-position/2012/02/17/gIQAAZePKR_story.html-URL-said of birth control , "I don't think it's a healthy thing for our country." He said he thought it was "harmful to women . . . harmful to society." He has said states have the right to ban contraception, though he would not vote for such a law.
On the role of women, he wrote in his 2005 book,  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/193223683X/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=washingtonpost-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=193223683X-URL-"It Takes a Family,"  "Radical feminists succeeded in undermining the traditional family and convincing women that professional accomplishments are the key to happiness. As for children? Well, to paraphrase  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1402766254/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=washingtonpost-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1402766254-URL-'The Wizard of Oz,'  pay no attention to those kids behind the curtain."
He opposes same-sex marriage, as do politicians in both parties, including the president. But some years ago, he accused leaders in the gay community of leading a "jihad" against him over  http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A7390-2003Apr21?language=printer-URL-comments he had made  in which he appeared to equate gay sex with bigamy and polygamy and more.
Those comments came during an interview with the Associated Press in 2003, after a Supreme Court decision that struck down anti-sodomy laws. "If the Supreme Court says that you have the right to consensual [gay] sex within your home, then you have the right to bigamy, you have the right to polygamy, you have the right to incest, you have the right to adultery," he said. "You have the right to anything."
In 2005, he intervened in the case of  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A15423-2005Mar31.html-URL-Terri Schiavo , a Florida woman who had been in a vegetative state for years. He and other Washington politicians urged that a federal judicial panel review a state court decision authorizing the removal of her feeding tube. He also met in Florida with her parents, who opposed the removal, to pray with them.
On environmental issues, he not only has opposed cap-and-trade legislation to deal with  http://www.washingtonpost.com/linksets/2010/07/06/ABcLr7D_linkset.html-URL-global climate change but  also has dismissed the issue as "the global warming hoax."

Explaining his remarks
Santorum has gone to some lengths to try to  http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/rick-santorum-has-honed-his-image-along-the-gop-campaign-trail/2012/02/09/gIQAHNjy6Q_story.html-URL-explain some of these comments . In some cases, the full context softens the impact of the most inflammatory words and phrases. But the trail he has left behind provides ample fodder for his critics and opponents.
Gary Bauer, a leading social conservative and a Santorum supporter, said that if handled well, the candidate's views on social issues, particularly with regard to the family, can attract votes from many working-class Americans. They are winners, he believes.
"Everything on the agenda of a conservative Republican Party requires the willingness and commitment to speak in more than 30-second sound bites," he said.
He added: "You have to choose your words carefully, but I disagree seriously, as you well know, with elites, including Republican elites. I'm not suggesting building a whole campaign on this. . . . But you can't run from this stuff."
Santorum advisers say that for every seemingly questionable statement, there is an explanation. His position on same-sex marriage is not different than Romney's or Obama's, they say. His views on women and the workplace have been totally misinterpreted. What he means is that women who choose to stay at home and raise their children should be prized by society as much as those who work outside the home.
In case that hasn't gotten through, advisers say Santorum's wife, Karen, will become a more visible presence on the campaign trail, and the campaign intends to have women who have worked for him out as surrogates.
On the Schiavo case, Santorum said in a  http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/florida-gop-debate-romney-calls-gingrich-influence-peddler-ramps-up-attacks/2012/01/24/gIQANqngNQ_story.html-URL-debate in Florida  last month that he happened to be in Florida at the time and went to Tampa to be with her parents, at their request. They were, he said, constituents who had asked for his assistance.
"I will agree that everything Rick Santorum says is not poll tested," Brabender said. But he said he is confident that, given a chance, Santorum can make his case to voters willing to give him a fair shot. On birth control and women's rights, for example, he said, "When people listen to the beginning, middle and end of what Rick Santorum says, people will say that's a very reasonable position."
But in the rough-and-tumble fight of a presidential campaign, Santorum could end up being buried in 30-second ads, whether from Romney and his PAC or in a general election, if he gets that far. A penchant for provocative language and aggressiveness has marked his career from the start.

He 'outworked everybody'
Santorum has always been a politician in a hurry. He won election to the House in 1990 despite being an underdog against a Democratic incumbent. Most officials at the National Republican Congressional Committee dismissed his chances and declined to give him the help he wanted. He won anyway.
"He just outworked everybody," said Terry Holt, a GOP strategist who as a young NRCC staffer was one of the few who saw Santorum's potential that year.
Despite being put into a more Democratic district, he won reelection in 1992 with 61 percent of the vote.
In the House, he became a member of the Gang of Seven, a group of freshman Republicans that included now-House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), who railed against the scandal at the House Bank and House Post Office. Their efforts helped undermine the Democratic majority, paving the way for the Republican takeover in 1994.
Even as a new House member, Santorum was looking to move up. In 1994, a good year for Republicans, he defeated incumbent Democratic senator Harris Wofford. He brought many of the same partisan tactics that were commonplace in then-speaker Newt Gingrich's House to the more sedate Senate. He took on conservative causes, playing a key role in the passage of welfare reform. He created resentment with his hard-charging ways and partisan elbows.
Reelected in 2000, he won the number three post in the party's leadership. While championing conservative causes, he continued to pay attention to the needs of Pennsylvania. He supported increases in the minimum wage and opposed right-to-work legislation (which he now says he would support as president). He continued to work cooperatively with then-Republican senator Arlen Specter, though they disagreed on most social issues.
Pollster Madonna, who described Santorum's conservatism as "pretty genuine . . . the real deal," said Romney can make a plausible argument that, as a senator, Santorum supported measures that today look like conservative heresy. But he said that shows how once-routine actions, even for conservatives, have been reinterpreted in the tea-party-dominated Republican Party.
"Republicans supported programs and pork and earmarks for their state, especially when you get into a state like Pennsylvania or Ohio, which had lost jobs because of the end of the industrial revolution," he said.
Former Pennsylvania governor Edward G. Rendell, a Democrat, said the attacks by Romney "are correct but there are reasons for them. He [Santorum] played by the rules of the game. Earmarks were commonplace and he worked to make sure Pennsylvania got its fair share of them, sometimes at my request as mayor [of Philadelphia] or governor."
David Urban, a lobbyist and former Specter chief of staff who supports Santorum's candidacy, called Santorum pragmatic in his approach as a senator. "I say he was pragmatic because he was a guy who knew how to get reelected in a state that definitely was not as conservative as he was personally but without yielding on his principles," he said.
After his 2000 election, say some longtime Santorum watchers, the senator became more outspoken on social issues, almost as if on a mission. But what may have been most remarkable about his career to that point is that someone as conservative as Santorum could continue to win elections in a state that has been as closely divided ideologically as Pennsylvania.
As one Pennsylvania Republican put it, "He was able to run through the raindrops without getting wet." As his views became better known, and as the political climate turned against him, his ideology caught up with him.
That was in 2006, when he drew as his opponent Robert P. Casey Jr., the state treasurer and son of a revered former governor. Casey also happened to be a Democrat who opposed abortion and gun control. In a year when Democrats took back control of the House and Senate, Santorum got wiped out, losing by 18 points, the most of any incumbent Republican defeated that year.

Predicting problems
A Republican and a Democratic strategist said independently that the 2006 race may not be a good measure of Santorum's viability or strength as a candidate, given the conditions. They point to his earlier campaigns as proof that he is a shrewd strategist and a dogged and effective campaigner. Another view is that, until 2006, he had been lucky in drawing weak opponents in reelection campaigns.
The implication of that is, if he was to become the Republican nominee, the weakness he showed in the suburbs of Philadelphia that year would be replicated in state after battleground state. Karl Rove, speaking Friday on Sean Hannity's program on Fox News, said Santorum's position on contraception will be "hard to explain" to a general election audience.
Privately, strategists in both parties predict huge problems for Santorum. A GOP strategist, who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to be candid, predicted that Santorum would be "eviscerated" by the Democrats in a general election. A Democrat who knows Santorum's record intimately and who also spoke on condition of anonymity to offer candid analysis, said Santorum would be "a Martian to women in the suburbs."
"I love Rick Santorum," the GOP strategist said. "But they're going to put the wood to him. He'll get defined by the Obama people so fast he won't know what hit him."
Obama advisers made it known this week that they have begun to look more seriously at  http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-campaign-turns-attention-to-santorum/2012/02/17/gIQAV0qKKR_story.html-URL-Santorum as a prospective rival , but already they see vulnerabilities they would try to exploit.
GOP strategist Holt said Santorum may not be more conservative than many others in the party, "but he's said and done things that are off-key" and that have undermined his potential appeal.
"This is his moment to shine," he added, "but now it becomes not so much a matter of ideology but of tone. There's no question that he's very conservative. Now it's how he handles questions that will be the test."

Avalanches kill fourat two ski resorts
Avalanches just minutes apart killed four people at two resorts Sunday - one burying three skiers at Stevens Pass in the Cascade Mountains and another sweeping a snowboarder off a cliff in Snoqualmie, Wash. 
Just before noon, a snowboarder at Alpental, one of four areas at the Summit at Snoqualmie resort, was with two friends when he triggered an avalanche that caused him to fall about 500 feet over a cliff, authorities say.
Minutes later, 12 skiers in an ungroomed, out-of-bounds area at the Stevens Pass resort were caught in an avalanche. Three of them did not respond to CPR and died, said Katie Larson, a spokeswoman with the King County Sheriff's Office.
The men, in their 30s or 40s,  were experienced skiers, she said.

Teen mom, baby and suspect found dead
A wanted man kidnapped his estranged girlfriend at gunpoint along with her 1-year-old daughter she was pushing in a stroller, Cleveland police said Sunday, and all three were found shot to death later. Police said the couple had dated for about two months and that the woman, Latasha Jackson, 19, was trying to end the relationship.
Jackson and her daughter, Chaniya Wynn, were walking with Jackson's 14-year-old brother on Saturday when they encountered the man, Thomas Lorde. The boy said Lorde ordered him to walk away.
Their bodies were found early Sunday in a closed garage of an unoccupied building, police Sgt. Sammy Morris said, and it appeared that Lorde shot himself.

Ambush in Syria kills senior prosecutor, judge

BYLINE: Bassem Mroue;Brian Murphy

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A12

LENGTH: 526 words

DATELINE: BEIRUT

BEIRUT - Gunmen in Syria staged a guerrilla-style ambush that killed a senior state prosecutor and a judge Sunday in an attack that suggested armed factions are growing bolder and more coordinated in their uprising against President Bashar al-Assad's government. 
The roadway slayings, according to a report by the state news agency, occurred in an opposition-dominated northern region. They came a day after a deadly hit-and-run attack on a political figure in the heart of the pro-Assad city of Aleppo.
The targeted killings have not reached Assad's inner circle, but they indicate a growing shift toward violent tactics by the opposition as it brings aboard more military defectors and seeks to tighten control over the small pieces of territory it holds.
The fears of a civil war have neighboring Jordan racing to finish a refugee camp near the Syrian border to handle a possible exodus of people fleeing for safety. Aid officials estimate that as many as 10,000 Syrian refugees already live in Jordan, mostly in private homes. They said the numbers are growing as the Syrian military escalates attacks on restive cities.
The growing unrest has also prompted some U.S. senators to call for arming the Syrian rebels. But in Washington, Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said such a move would be "premature."
"I would challenge anyone to clearly identify for me the opposition movement in Syria at this point," he said on CNN's "Fareed Zakaria GPS" program, aired Sunday. Dempsey said Syria is "an arena right now for all of the various interests to play out," including Turkey, Iran, Russia and possibly al-Qaeda. "Until we're a lot clearer about . . . who they are and what they are, I think it would be premature to talk about arming them," he said of the rebels.
Violence was reported in various parts of Syria on Sunday. The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that at least 14 people were killed across the country, half of them by government troops. In Homs, in central Syria, government forces sent in reinforcements and shelled the rebel-held Baba Amr district, which has been under near-constant barrage for nearly two weeks, the group said.
The assassinations of the prosecutor and judge occurred in the northwest province of Idlib. The Syrian Arab News Agency said gunmen opened fire on a car carrying Idlib provincial state prosecutor Nidal Ghazal and Judge Mohammed Ziadeh, who were killed instantly. Their driver also was fatally wounded.
Idlib has been the site of intense clashes between troops loyal to Assad and army defectors who attack and then disappear into the rugged mountains.
In Jordan, the United Nations refugee agency is working with the government on preparations for the refugee camp, which can house 1,000 family-size tents, according to the agency's deputy chief in Amman, Arafat Jamal.
Sami Halaseh, who oversees the project for the Public Works Ministry, said the 323-square-foot area, located about 12 miles south of the border, is expected to be ready in two weeks, after bathrooms and hangars for food distribution are installed. He said the project cost $1 million.

CORRECTION: A Feb. 20 A-section article by the Associated Press, about an ambush in Syria that killed a prosecutor and a judge, incorrectly described the site of a refugee camp being prepared in Jordan as 323 square feet. The actual size is 30,000 square meters, or 35,880 square yards, according to Sami Halaseh, who is overseeing the camp's preparation for Jordan's Ministry of Public Works and Housing.

FDA agrees to review caffeine inhaler
Caffeine that can be inhaled, which may be used as a "club drug" by teenagers, according to a senator, will be reviewed by U.S. regulatorsthe FDA, officials said.
The AeroShot Pure Energy caffeine inhaler became available last month in New York and Boston and delivers 100 milligrams of caffeine, the same amount as in a large cup of coffee.
Though the product did not require clearance because it is classified as a dietary supplement, Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) requested a Food and Drug Administration review, saying it could pose hazards to teens if taken with alcohol. Doctors say it may carry neurological and cardiovascular risks. 
The FDA said it would review the product and respond directly to Schumer. Last year, at Schumer's urging, the FDA stopped sales of caffeinated alcoholic beverages after they were linked to hospitalizations and deaths.

Glenn chats with crew of space station
NASA surprised John Glenn with the kind of anniversary gift only a space agency can give, enabling him to speak live with the international space station Monday as he marked 50 years since his historic spaceflight.
The former astronaut and senator from Ohio, now 90, became the first American to orbit the Earth on Feb. 20, 1962. He celebrated the anniversary at Ohio State University by kicking off a forum about NASA's future.
Sitting on stage with Glenn and NASA Administrator Charles Bolden, he Jr. chatted with three of the station's crew members about space research and NASA's future. Cmdr. Don Burbank appeared by video link, flanked by two flight engineers floating in the zero-gravity environment. Burbank said the crew was delighted to commemorate Glenn's trip.
"Fifty years ago today, Friendship 7 was orbiting planet Earth, and that helped in a very big way, paved the way for America to become a space power, and to go to the moon, and to do the things that we're doing right now on the international space station," Burbank said. 
When Bolden asked the astronauts which experiment they would like to hand off to Glenn if he could join them, Burbank suggested research on the "regenerative environmental control systems" on the spacecraft.
 "That's a fancy word for our toilet," flight engineer Don Pettit added. "So he wants to put Senator Glenn busy fixing the plumbing up here."

9-month-old boy killed in shooting
Attackers peppered a house on Detroit's west side with gunshots early Monday, killing a 9-month-old boy, police said.
Delric Miller was in the living room and other children and adults were at home when the shooting happened around 4:30 a.m., police told reporters. Police Chief Ralph Godbee said at a news conference the shooting was gang-related. An AK-47 rifle was used in the attack. No arrests have been made. 
Detroit saw a rise in homicides last year. There were 41 homicides this year as of Feb. 12, compared with 33 in the same period of 2011.

Storm causes accidents, power outages: A winter storm that dumped several inches of snow across parts of the South, causing power outages, slippery roads and numerous accidents during the Presidents' Day holiday weekend, moved out to sea Monday. Crews were working to restore power to tens of thousands of households that lost electricity. The storm brought up to nine inches of snow in some areas as it powered its way across the region from Kentucky and Tennessee to West Virginia, Virginia and North Carolina.

Retrieving the Taliban's war dead

BYLINE: Kevin Sieff

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A01

LENGTH: 1783 words

DATELINE: IN KANDAHAR, AFGHANISTAN

Abdul Hakim gets the first calls just after the bombs explode and the firefights end, when all that is left are the remains of the dead. 
The voices on the other end belong to Taliban commanders whom Hakim has come to know well. The first sentence is almost always the same: "We're looking for a body."
In the southern province that has borne more violence and death than any other since the war began, the Taliban knows Hakim as the man who can retrieve insurgents' bodies from American and Afghan authorities and return them to their families and comrades.
In the past six years, he has done it 127 times, carrying letters of permission from both the Afghan government and the Taliban as he weaves through Kandahar in a beat-up yellow taxicab, with dead insurgents in the trunk. Black bags for those killed in firefights. Small wooden boxes for what's left of suicide bombers.  
"It doesn't matter who the dead are or who they belong to," Hakim said. "They deserve a proper Islamic burial."
The U.S. military follows a regimented procedure for retrieving and repatriating its war dead, one that is exacting in detail and rich with ceremony. In this most asymmetric of wars, the Taliban has constructed a parallel process, as shadowy and unpolished as it is effective.
Taliban militants are known to fight ferociously to recover their fallen, and efforts to bury their own do not fade after insurgents leave the battlefield. When militants' bodies are recovered by foreign troops, a choreography unfolds: Several times a month, a NATO helicopter deposits insurgents' bodies at a mortuary next to Kandahar Airfield, where they are checked for unexploded bombs and placed in the same room as U.S. war dead. A flag-wrapped coffin for the Americans and a plywood box for the insurgents sit side by side.
The International Committee of the Red Cross then takes the remains of the insurgents, along with a file of information about them - photographs, a description of how each was killed - to Mirwais Hospital in Kandahar city. In the morgue's register, they are identified by their job title, written simply as "Talib."
The insurgents often share space in the Mirwais morgue with their victims, also transported by the ICRC. The grim toll emerges in the morgue's register: President Hamid Karzai's brother, the mayor of Kandahar and dozens of civilians, police officers and insurgents have been kept in the white refrigerated trailer, imported from Denmark, over the past seven months. A pile of clothes, stripped from the dead, lies nearby.
On a single day earlier this year, according to the register, four police officers were killed in an explosion, a shopkeeper was shot dead and a district governor was assassinated. About 150 bodies come through the Mirwais morgue each month. 
On the register, next to the names of the dead, family members have scrawled their signatures or, in the case of the illiterate, left blue thumbprints as a record of who took the remains for burial. But next to the names of Talibs, the same man has signed dozens of times: Abdul Hakim.
Hakim is known as a malik, a respected community representative whose autonomy from the government as well as the insurgency allows him to operate in both worlds, even as they attempt to destroy each other.
"He's very important - he's one guy who can do it all.  He is a completely neutral facilitator," said Julien Lerisson, the deputy head of the ICRC sub-delegation in Kandahar. 

'Transferring our martyrs'
Hakim came to his job by accident. In the late 1990s, he took a volunteer course with the Afghan Red Crescent Society, the ICRC's local counterpart. To the Taliban, Hakim's connection meant that he might have access to the bodies of fighters recovered by foreign troops. 
In 2005, a Taliban commander contacted him for the first time about a body. After Hakim managed to retrieve it, the requests kept coming. On Taliban letterhead, he is given written permission to do the job.
"I tell to all Mujahidin of this area, this person is cooperating with us on the issue of transferring our martyrs. If you have any problem with him, contact us," the letter reads. It is signed by Jabar Agha, identified as the Taliban's representative for Zhari district in Kandahar. It refers to Hakim as a taxi driver. 
When the fighters are finally placed in shallow graves marked by jagged stones, some of the families rail about their deceased kin's unnecessary death and poor choices. Others gather to celebrate the devotion of those they consider martyrs. 
Hakim, a 65-year-old with deep creases in his forehead, a long white beard and a scar under his right eye, tries to leave before the funeral processions begin. The war has brought him personal tragedy, and he wants to keep the old anguish from resurfacing. But the families often grab him before he drives off, he said, to thank him through tears. 
"When we saw my brother's body, the bullet holes in his chest, it was terrible. But we saw his face. It was the same as always. We got to say goodbye," said Ahmad, whose brother joined the Taliban several years ago and was killed in a firefight with Afghan police. It was Hakim who returned the body.

Sorting carnage of war
Hakim receives the second round of phone calls - this time, from the ICRC - days or weeks after fits of violence. The organization draws on its vast network of Afghan elders to identify unclaimed bodies in the Mirwais morgue: men killed in such remote locations or uncertain conditions that Taliban commanders and family members don't come looking for them. 
Not all of the bodies are those of insurgents - about two-thirds are those of civilians and government security officials, mostly police officers.
Hakim transports all of them: 107 government employees in the past three years and 28 civilians, in addition to the 127 insurgents. He gets a signed letter from local officials giving him permission to pick up each body; he stores copies in a black suitcase at home, so he can keep a precise count of the bodies he has transported. 
Last year, he picked up the remains of 14 suicide bombers on a single day, trucking them to families across Kandahar province. Once he carried five Afghan intelligence agents from a district largely controlled by the Taliban to their agency's headquarters. He has hauled the bodies of children and the elderly, he said, sometimes on the same day. 
Across the country, men like Hakim assist civilians and Taliban commanders, even slipping into Pakistan to return the bodies of insurgents. Their efforts have had a pronounced effect in recent times: The number of unclaimed bodies in Afghanistan decreased by 50 percent last year, according to the ICRC. 
But none of those crisscrossing the front lines have devoted as much time as Hakim to sorting the carnage of war.
"There's no one who sees as much of the dead," said Sardar Mohammed Niazmand, director of the Red Crescent in Kandahar.
Because members of the Taliban and Afghan security forces are often sent to fight in provinces far from their homes, the family of a man killed in Kandahar could be hundreds of miles away. Sometimes, it can take weeks or months for word to reach home that a man has been killed. The bodies are kept in the morgue for about two months, while men like Hakim search for the families. 

Tragedy hits home
Hakim makes the third round of calls himself, dialing villagers and Taliban commanders across Kandahar, after he has seen the bodies in Mirwais. "Are you looking for a short man with a black beard, around 21?" he asked his contacts recently. "Do you know of any suicide bombers who died in Zhari district late last month?" he asked others. 
If they say yes, Hakim gets an undisclosed sum of money from the ICRC for his expenses and a little profit. Then he drives off in his rented taxicab to meet weeping families or hardened insurgents.
Last year, he almost gave up making those calls. Everyone expected him to. 
Two of his four sons were driving to a picnic with a friend who worked with the U.S. military, he said. Taliban snipers saw the car, identified the driver as a target and started shooting. Both of Hakim's sons were killed.
"I was helping these guys. I was doing something they needed," he said. "I asked them, 'Why did you do this?' "
Hakim never got a good answer. He picked up his sons' bodies in the same taxi he uses to transport insurgents. He buried them. He mourned for two days. Then he started taking calls from the Taliban again. He returned to work.
"This is how I help my country," he said, pausing to think. "And who else could do this job?"
When the director of the morgue, Wali Mohammed, saw him for the first time after the incident, he was incredulous.
"We're not sure why he keeps doing this," he said.

Burying the unclaimed
Then there are the calls Hakim hopes not to make - the ones to local mullahs, after his efforts to find the deceased's families end in failure. When there are no relatives to bury the dead, Hakim often makes the arrangements himself.
The mullahs come to a plot of land owned by Hakim, now a graveyard for the unclaimed. They say a prayer, then chant "God is great" four times, lifting their hands to their ears. 
He helps bathe the body, dresses it in a white cloth, called a kafan, and helps place it in the ground. 
Hakim knows where each body is buried. He takes photos of the corpses with his cellphone camera, so if a family comes to Kandahar months or years later, he will be able to connect the right body to the right grave. The ICRC keeps a more official file of photos of unclaimed bodies, along with information about where each has been buried in the organization's graveyard in Kandahar. 
A few times a year, ICRC employees go through the file at the request of families searching for a relative. Sometimes bodies are exhumed. Sometimes belated funerals are held.
A few months ago, a man came from Paktia province, 300 miles away, to find his missing brother. Hakim showed him a grainy photo on his phone and took him to the right grave, where the two prayed together.
In the course of his travels across Kandahar, people ask him about his politics: Are you a Talib? Do you support the government?
Even his relatives want to know: What does a man who spends his days transporting the war dead think about the war?
On that topic, Hakim doesn't say much.
"Like everyone, I want peace," he said. "I have respect for both sides, and I want my country to be whole again. But right now there is war. People are dying, and we must deal with it."

EGYPT

Mubarak should die,prosecutor concludes
The chief prosecutor in the trial of ousted Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak said Monday in closing remarks in Cairo that the former president should receive the death penalty for the killings of protesters in last year's uprising.
Mustafa Suleiman said Mubarak, who ruled over Egypt for nearly 30 years, clearly authorized use of live ammunition and a shoot-to-kill policy against peaceful protesters. According to government estimates, 850 people were killed in the crackdown from Jan. 25 to Feb. 11, 2011.
For this, Suleiman told the presiding judges, Mubarak and five co-defendants, including his longtime interior minister, Habib al-Adli, should be given the maximum sentence. 
Mubarak's defense team is to present its closing arguments Wednesday, the same day that the presiding judge will announce a date for the verdict.

RUSSIA

Candidate Putin vows defense buildup
Less than two weeks before a presidential election, Vladimir Putin laid out ambitious plans Monday for modernizing and strengthening Russia's defense forces over the next decade, in the face of a threatening world and a powerful United States.
"For Russia to feel secure and for our partners to listen carefully to what our country has to say," the premier wrote, Moscow must spend about $775 billion by 2022 for new armaments and a more professional military.
"We see zones of instability and artificially maintained, managed chaos emerging," he wrote in an article that was one of a seriesof campaign platforms. "Furthermore, we see how some are purposefully provoking such conflicts in the immediate vicinity of Russia's borders."
He said Russia's military response to the U.S. missile defense shield would be "effective and asymmetrical."
Analysts, on the left and right, were skeptical that he can accomplish such a buildup.

ISRAEL

Appeal moved up for Palestinian prisoner
Israel's Supreme Court has brought forward a hearing this week on the appeal of a Palestinian prisoner waging an unprecedented two-month hunger strike, court officials and his lawyers said Monday.
A statement from the Supreme Court said Khader Adnan's appeal will be held Tuesday. No explanation was given as to why it was brought forward. It had been set to take place Thursday.
Adnan's lawyer Mahmoud Hassan says the 33-year-old member of Islamic Jihad is in danger of death after 65 days of a hunger strike protesting Israel's policy of "administrative detention," under which Palestinians can be held without charge. Israel has defended the policy as a way to address security threats.
The case has drawn widespread attention among Palestinians, sparking regular protests.. Adnan, arrested Dec. 17, has not been charged with a crime.

Albanian soldier killed in Afghanistan: Gunmen in Afghan police uniforms opened fire on NATO troops in the Spin Boldak district of Afghanistan's Kandahar province, killing an Albanian soldier, officials said. A second Albanian and another NATO soldier were wounded. Eleven suspected policemen were arrested. It was the first time an Albanian soldier was killed in Afghanistan.
Gunmen attack Yemen polling sites: Gunmen attacked three polling stations in Yemen's restive south, officials said, a day before the country is to go to the polls to rubber stamp its vice president as the new head of state after 33 years of one-man rule. A total of four people were reported killed in clashes across the country. The violence underlines the security vacuum in the Arabian peninsula's poorest country after a one-year popular uprising seeking to oust longtime President Ali Abdullah Saleh.

On this day, anyway, the Nats can go easy

DATELINE: VIERA, FLA.

VIERA, Fla. - Pitching coach Steve McCatty bumped intoWilson Ramos, jostling him sideways, as they passed in a narrow clubhouse corridor here on Monday as the Washington Nationals pitchers and catchers reported to spring training.
"So, how was your winter?" asked McCatty. "Anything goin' on?"
Ramos stood stunned, blank-faced and speechless - totally fooled for a blink. Then infielder Andres Blanco started cracking up. "I see, I see," said a laughing Ramos, who was kidnapped in November, held captive in a Venezuelan mountain shack for two days and freed after a gun battle.
McCatty's day will come. No baseball gag goes unsettled. 
Reporting day may be baseball's most relaxed and talkative day. The game never neglects a tradition. Few are sweeter than this day of greetings.
"What did you think when you learned your pitching staff had added Gio Gonzalez and Edwin Jackson," McCatty was asked.
"I thought, 'Our team just got better, but I got dumber,' " he said. "Now, it's always going to be either 'They pitched good' or 'I coached horsesheep.' "
Ah, the first horsesheep of spring, that mythical baseball creature that, used as all seven parts of speech, is a surer harbinger than any robin. 
The optimistic Nats walked into their clubhouse to get physicals and immediately started yakking, just like all big leaguers on their first day back together, as if their words had been saved up, stifled, for four months.
John Lannan told how, on his honeymoon in Tahiti, he ran into Nats free agent target Prince Fielder, who was there to renew his marriage vows. Renew vows. In Tahiti. At 26? The Married Guys Union will file a protest. 
Ryan Zimmerman said that ardent hunter Adam LaRoche had killed a buffalo. With a bow and arrow. LaRoche, with a large biceps tat of a buck with huge antlers, did not confirm this info, but did say animals are smarter than you think, communicate well and "so I hide [the tattoo] when I hunt."
This is the eternal baseball tone, better than a Florida fountain of youth, addictive for life, where absolutely anything might be true or a setup line. When a player such as LaRoche or rookie Steve Lombardozzi had a big league dad, then the stone-faced playfulness, the put-on, the mimicry, is ingrained. 
After a winter of golf, what is your handicap down to, Davey?
"Are we bettin' or braggin'?" said Manager Davey Johnson.
Who cares about scores when Johnson can quickly turn the tale to his lifetime total of deadly snakes killed on his build-on-a-swamp home golf course in Winter Haven. "Three rattlesnakes and a water moccasin," he said. "I use a 2-iron. You take it up high above your head and hit down." 
Like a bunker shot?
"Sort of." 
Why a 2-iron?
"To keep 'em far away from you. Then, when they strike, you hit them when they're in mid-air."
Aren't witnesses required for "Dead Rattlers," like holes-in-one?
"Oh, that sounds like Davey. Only three?" said Danny Espinosa slyly.
Baseball lives in details as small as a handshake. This spring, Espinosa's grip will bring tears. Off-handedly, Johnson mentions that last year Espinosa hit well right-handed but poorly left-handed. "That's going to change dramatically this year," said Johnson. Why? Because of that handshake.
All last year, Espinosa was recovering from offseason hamate-bone surgery to his right wrist that sapped his grip strength from 160 to 125 on the grip meter. His left hand measured 150 both years.
"I've always hit better left-handed than right-handed, except after that injury (and surgery). It's the strength in your right hand that lets you deliver the barrel of the bat to the ball accurately when you hit left-handed," says Espinosa, whose OPS was .707 hitting lefty in '11, but .857 righty. So, if Espinosa breaks out in '12, his mates probably knew it from the first shake. 
"This is a great time of year. Until the first pitch [on opening day], they're all still invincible," said General Manager Mike Rizzo.
Actually, the only Nat who wasn't talking with typical spring training bravado was Bryce Harper, 19, whose recent tweet, comparing his future social life in D.C. to Joe Namath's in New York, did not amuse the Nats.
"Come see me in my office," Rizzo said to Harper in the clubhouse, then added with an edge, "Before you talk to the media." Harper didn't notice and went to Rizzo's office later with a half-eaten sandwich in hand.
Later, a restrained Harper mixed his usual enthusiasm with a different tone. A visit to the principal's office? Probably. Someday we'll be certain.
Harper plans "to try to make it hard" on the Nats to send him down, "but if I have to go to the minors, which I don't want to talk about, that happens, too. . . . There are so many things I have to improve. . . . Last season was a grind, every day. I need to hit the weight room more during the season to keep my strength [up], which I didn't understand." 
Defense needs work, too, "not trying to amp up [his extremely strong arm] and throw it 10 rows up in the seats" after overthrowing the cutoff man.
Of his post-Namath-tweet beat-down, he said, "I like to interact with my fans [to let them know] who I am and what I am. That's just how I am. . . . I'm going to get blown up either way. . . . I'm never going to back off."
But at least he backpedaled, saying that when it came to social media, "I need to learn from my mistakes" and "I need to grow up in that respect, I guess."
Johnson tried to open the door for Harper, but he may have shut it, halfway, on his own foot. If you want to know Harper's chances of being a National this season, then count his public remarks that draw attention to himself as if he were a star brand, and think of each of those episodes as a strikeout.
This was a day for jokes, gibes and flagrant optimism, with a small dose of Harper realism, to calm things down, around the edges. 
"The potential I see on this ballclub is pretty damn high. This team has more potential than those Mets - it's more athletic," said Johnson of his '84-'90 teams. "But that Mets team played up to its full ability."
Potential, with its pressures and pitfalls, is weeks away. For now, the breeze here is soft and warm, getting kidnapped is still fair game and all the rattlesnakes are dead ones.

Deal reached on Greek bailout

BYLINE: Michael Birnbaum

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A08

DATELINE: ATHENS

ATHENS - After months in which Greece teetered on the verge of bankruptcy, European officials agreed Tuesday to give the country a second massive bailout in exchange for harsh austerity measures, as grim new estimates about the country's economy pushed off a resolution until what some officials called the last possible day to reach one.
The decision buys time for the Mediterranean country to try to fix its massive problems, and gives assurances to the world that a Greek default - and its possibly disastrous ripple effects - will be forestalled, at least for now. If Greece had been cut loose, it probably would have defaulted in late March, and doubts about the viability of larger countries such as Spain and Italy might have grown.
The euro jumped in value, surging 0.7 percent in minutes, to $1.328, as news of the accord emerged from the all-night meeting.  
Under the terms of the deal, private bondholders will take a larger loss than had previously been planned in an attempt to get Greece's debt to what European officials consider a sustainable level by 2020. The officials also agreed to reduce the interest they charge Greece for the long-term loans. 
But a recent European assessment about Greece's finances left questions about whether the country would truly be able to live up to the stringent demands to which it has agreed, or whether it would default eventually even with a second bailout. 
"We have reached a far-reaching agreement on Greece's new program and private-sector involvement that will lead to a very significant debt reduction for Greece," Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker, who heads the bloc of 17 countries that use the euro, told reporters in Brussels after a 14-hour negotiation. He called the amount of aid "unprecedented."
Greek officials said before the meeting that their country had done what had been asked of it.
"Greece comes into today's Eurogroup meeting having fulfilled all the requirements for the approval of the new program," Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said in a statement released after the Brussels meeting had begun. "The Greek people . . . will make the necessary sacrifices in order for our country to regain its place within the European family."
Under the plans negotiated between the Greek government and European leaders, officials said Tuesday, Greece will receive a $172 billion bailout in exchange for taking harsh austerity measures that officials believe will make it more competitive. Greece will also write down 53.5 percent of the nominal face value of its privately held debt as a way of getting back on track by 2020.
The aid would come atop a previous bailout of $145 billion in May 2010, making Greece, a country of 11 million people that is just 2 percent of the euro zone's economy, the recipient of by far the largest bailout in European Union history.
Last week, Juncker vowed to spend his weekend doing everything he could to find ways to further cut Greece's debt. But by Monday, it became clear just how short it would fall of its targets.
An internal public-creditor document showed that Greece would have a debt by 2020 of 129 percent of its gross domestic product, Reuters reported, well short of the 120 percent target that they believe would keep Greece from going bankrupt in the future. 
Even small failures to meet interim targets along the way could send that ratio shooting higher, the report said. The deal reached Tuesday morning would help Greece get closer to its goal, bringing the debt down to 120.5 percent in eight years. But the same threats - of an exacerbated recession, of political difficulties implementing the cuts - remained.
Some European countries - Germany and the Netherlands chief among them - drew a hard line on giving Greece any more assistance if no plan was devised that got the country closer to the 120 percent goal.
"We can help, but we are not going to pour money into a bottomless pit," German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told German radio last week, jarring Greeks, who raised the specter of the Nazi occupation of their country.
Without the aid, Greece would be bankrupted when a $19 billion debt payment comes due on March 20. But because of the complexity of the deal, its outlines must be set far earlier. 
Greece will have to allow a roughly two-week-long window for its bondholders to sign on to the plan to write down debt, and parliaments in Germany, the Netherlands and Finland will have to approve their countries' contributions to the aid.
"It cannot wait any longer," French Finance Minister Francois Baroin said Monday in an interview with Europe 1 radio.
But many Greeks question whether the terms of the bailout will do much to help their economy in the coming years, and the "troika" of the International Monetary Fund, European Union and European Central Bank acknowledged that the recession would worsen in the short run, even as unemployment has already spiked to 21 percent - 49 percent for those younger than 25 - and the economy contracted by 7 percent in the third quarter of 2011.
Europe has demanded that the public sector shrink by 150,000 people, that the minimum wage be lowered by 22 percent, that pensions be cut and that Greece do more to sell off its publicly owned companies, among other measures that filled a 50-page booklet. 
When the Greek parliament started implementing them last week, 43 of the deputies in the ruling coalition rebelled, and riotersin Athens set dozens of buildings on fire.
 European leaders, stung by the sense that Greek leaders failed to live up to the promises they made to qualify for the first bailout, have said they would channel new bailout funds into a special escrow account that Greece will be able to use only to make debt payments, not for its ordinary government expenses, in essence forcing Greece to prioritize its creditors over its own citizens. And they said they would increase their monitors in Athens to make sure Greece was meeting targets. 
"I am in favor of more control, more supervision," Dutch Finance Minister Jan Kees de Jager told reporters in Brussels on his way into the meeting. "Money is the thing we can control Greece with."
Few expected this to be the last time officials gather in Brussels to discuss the country's fate, even assuming the bailout proceeds without hiccups. 
If Greece fails to take the difficult measures that are its end of the deal, Europe may be inclined to cut off the money, especially after a permanent bailout fund is set up in July that would do more to keep the pain of a Greek default isolated inside the country.
"The message that was sent by policymakers, especially in Germany, was that the price for keeping Greece in the euro zone is not infinite," said Jean Pisani-Ferry, the director of Bruegel, an economic think tank in Brussels.

Survivor recalls startling bullets, then bodies

Ra'Shauna Brown never heard the bullets coming.
She and her best friend, Brishell Jones, had just polished off a pineapple pizza from Domino's at Brishell's house in Southeast Washington the evening of March 30, 2010. Then, still clad in the RIP T-shirts they'd worn earlier that day to the funeral of a slain friend, the teenage girls walked a few blocks up South Capitol Street SE to meet up with several friends who had also attended the funeral.
In the first interview she's given describing one of the District's worst mass shootingsin decades, Brown said she was chatting with her friends and singing along with an Alicia Keys song on her iPod when her left leg suddenly gave out and she fell to the ground. Brown can't recall hearing any gunshots or even the screech of car tires. 
As she lay on the ground, she saw smoke rising from the grass and struggled to make sense of it. It was then that she realized she had been shot in her leg, said Brown, who is expected to testify in the coming days against the five men accused of being involved in the shootings. Brown had been shot twice, in her left knee and in her back.
Brown, then 17, looked down at her feet and saw Brishell, an aspiring chef who had been her closest friend since middle school.
"Brishell. Brishell. Brishell," Brown remembered calling.
Brishell, 16, who had been shot in her right temple, didn't answer. Brown called out to another friend, DaVaughn Boyd, 18, lying just a few feet from her. Again, no response. Also lying nearby was the body of William Jones III, 19.
Panicked, Brown reached into her jacket, pulled out her cellphone and called 911. "I don't know what happened, but I think someone shot at us," she told the operator.
Then Brown called her mother. "I think I've been shot," she cried.
Finally, Brown tried to call Brishell's mother, Nardyne Jefferies, but she didn't pick up.
Brown had been shot with an AK-47 assault-style weapon and a .45-caliber semiautomatic, she would later discover. One bullet struck her left knee and exited her inner thigh. The other bullet struck her back and exited under her left shoulder.
In all, four people were fatally shot that evening and six others, including Brown, were wounded - part of a retaliatory killing spree that had begun nine days earlier with the theft of a gold-colored bracelet at a party on Alabama Avenue.
On Tuesday, five men accused of being involved in that string of shootings are scheduled to go on trial in D.C. Superior Court: Orlando Carter, 22; his brother, Sanquan, 21; Jeffrey D. Best, 23; Robert Bost, 23; and Lamar Williams, 23. Each faces about 90 charges, including multiple counts of first-degree murder, conspiracy, and assault and weapons charges. If convicted, all five could face life in prison.
The case is being heard by Judge Ronna L. Beck. It's not the first time Beck has presided over a case involving one of the Carter men. In November 2009, Sanquan Carter was charged with armed carjacking and other offenses. As his trial approached, Carter's attorneys argued that he should be released from the D.C. jail and into a halfway house. Prosecutors repeatedly objected, but on March 19, 2010, Beck ordered Carter released to the halfway house.
Three days later, the killing spree began, police said. The first to die was Jordan Howe, 20, who was gunned down after the Alabama Avenue party. Three others were injured. Prosecutors say that attack eventually led to the South Capitol Street shootings.
It was Howe's funeral that Brishell and Brown had attended on March 30.
Although they were only 10 months apart in age, Brown considered Brishell, or "Bree" as she called her, her "little sister." They both loved cartoons (Brown's favorite was "Scooby-Doo," Brishell's was "Hello Kitty"), shopping and eating together at restaurants. They even planned to go to college in the same town in Florida after they graduated from high school, Brown said.
At Brishell's funeral, she sat in the second pew behind Brishell's parents and other family members. Though she was still recovering from her injuries, she wanted to be there.
"To me, it was just the last time I could see her," Brown recalled. It was the only funeral of her three friends killed that night that she attended. "My mother didn't want me to be overwhelmed," she said.
After the shooting, her mother had to sleep with her each night for about two months. Even taking a shower by herself was frightening. And whenever she heard a car go past her house, especially at night, she would become anxious.
Brown, now a freshman psychology major at a college in West Virginia, said she still flinches sometimes when she spots a vehicle racing past her. Someday she hopes to work with people who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder.
She and Brishell's mother talk weekly. Jefferies took Brown shopping for school supplies at the beginning of the school year. And earlier this month, Jefferies sent her $100 for her 19th birthday.
"She's my second mom," Brown said. "Her family is my family."
The two sat together during a hearing last year in D.C. Superior Court. It was the first time Brown had seen the five men prosecutors say are responsible for so much violence. If she's called to testify at their trial, Brown said, she'll be "uncomfortable" having to describe the night of the shootings in front of them.
"To sit there and talk about what they did to me, and Brishell being gone, it's going to be weird," she said.
Brown still bears the physical scars from the deadly night on her leg and back. The nerves in her left arm, below where the first bullet exited, have not healed properly, leaving her without feeling in part of her arm.
She said she realizes she is "blessed" to have survived the attack.
"I don't know what's so significant about my life, but I cherish it. I really do," Brown said. "I know there is a reason I am still here. I am trying to figure that out so I can live up to it."

A suicidal veteran's plea for help could land him in jail

BYLINE: Christian Davenport

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A01

LENGTH: 1270 words

At the lowest moment of his life, Sean Duvall pulled out his cellphone just past midnight and called a suicide hotline. He was carrying a final note to his family, a letter confirming his eligibility to be buried in the Southwest Virginia Veterans Cemetery and a homemade gun fashioned from a pipe.
He told the Department of Veterans Affairs counselor who answered the phone that  June night that he was going to kill himself.
Stay put, the counselor urged him, after learning that Duvall had wandered onto the campus of Virginia Tech. Help is on the way.  
Soon a police officer arrived and took the 45-year-old homeless Persian Gulf War veteran to a psychiatric facility, where he was treated for depression and began feeling better. 
Had it ended at that, Duvall's story would be evidence that the efforts to save veterans - who take their lives at a rate of 18 a day - are having an impact. But what happened next has infuriated veterans groups and mental health advocates.
Shortly after Duvall was released from the hospital, he found himself in trouble again. This time with the law. 
Duvall, who served in the Navy and lives outside Roanoke, now faces four federal counts related to manufacturing and possessing the homemade gun, which could lead to a 40-year prison sentence.  
Veterans groups and mental health advocates warn that Duvall's prosecution could have a chilling effect on distressed veterans who might be contemplating suicide. 
"Every veteran I've talked to is outraged," said Dan Karnes, president of the Roanoke Valley Veterans Council. "When we have veterans that are coming back from wars now, they'll think twice about seeking help when they see what was done to him."
Another focus of their ire: the man in charge of the office pursuing the charges against Duvall. If anyone should be sensitive to the needs of veterans, they say, it should be Timothy Heaphy, who is the U.S. attorney for the Western District of Virginia and the son-in-law of  Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric K. Shinseki. 
And the case's military connections don't end with Shinseki, a retired Army chief of staff. Randy Cargill, Duvall's public defender, who is a West Point graduate and veteran,  argues that the country Duvall served is now betraying him. Cargill has filed a motion to dismiss the charges, saying that his client was calling a confidential hotline and that by prosecuting him the government is violating that trust.
Duvall "risked everything for his country," Cargill wrote. "He became a link in the chain of mutual trust that is the backbone of our armed forces. He was there when his comrades needed him. And when he needed help, he trusted his government would provide it on the terms offered - in confidence."
Through a spokesman, Heaphy declined to comment. But his office has argued that it has an obligation to prosecute Duvall, who admitted to making and possessing the weapon and was on the Virginia Tech campus, the site of a mass shooting in 2007, at the time of his call. By responding and getting him help, authorities "saved Duvall's life," Assistant U.S. Attorney Donald R. Wolthuis wrote in response to the motion to dismiss the charges.
"Certainly, the prospect of a mentally unstable, armed individual on the Virginia Tech campus, who has a present intention to cause violent harm, certainly captures our attention," Wolthuis said at a hearing last week.
He acknowledged that Duvall is, in many ways, a sympathetic figure, but he said in court papers that "as much as we, as a society, appreciate the efforts and sacrifices made by war veterans such as Duvall, their status as veterans does not make them above the law. The law must be applied with equal force to all in this country, and Duvall must face the pending charges, just as anybody else would."

Battling depression
Duvall grew up in a military family. His father was a retired Marine who served in the Vietnam War. His mother served in the Navy. His grandfather served during World War II. 
He graduated from Gar-Field High School in Woodbridge in 1984, according to his Facebook page, and then attended Virginia Commonwealth University. He enlisted in the Navy in 1991, during the Persian Gulf War, and was deployed to the gulf and off the coast of Somalia. He received positive evaluations from superiors, one of whom called him "diligent and resourceful" and "a dedicated team player." In 1995, Duvall was honorably discharged.
Duvall and Cargill declined to be interviewed for this article.
After his military career, Duvall worked various jobs, including a 10-year stint at a Roanoke steel plant. Then, in 2008, his father died, which "greatly affected him," according to court records. He left his job at the plant and later another job at Virginia Tech, where he worked part-time as a cook.  
Between 2006 and 2010, he was found guilty of several offenses, including public intoxication, driving while intoxicated and destruction of property. In 2010, he was treated for depression at a VA Hospital. And by June 2011, he was unemployed, behind on his bills and homeless.
For a week, the divorced father of two, who has salt-and-pepper hair and a thick mustache, wandered aimlessly around Blacksburg, thinking about ending his life. Some nights he slept outside an abandoned apartment building near Virginia Tech; sometimes he walked all night, according to court papers. He wrote a goodbye note to his family. 
Just after midnight on June 8, he pulled out a VA handbook, found the number for the suicide hotline and called. 

'An act of courage'
In cases where there is an imminent threat, VA counselors have an obligation to notify law enforcement under agency regulations. But the VA has made efforts to keep veterans out of jail through the Veteran Justice Outreach Initiative, a program that began in 2009 and is designed "to avoid the unnecessary criminalization of mental illness and extended incarceration among veterans."
In a statement, VA spokesman Josh Taylor said veterans should have confidence in the crisis line: "Calling the Veterans Crisis Line is an act of courage, and VA crisis responders are there to provide help and save veterans' lives."
The hotline receives several hundred calls a day, although only a small percentage are from veterans in danger of hurting themselves or others. 
At a budget hearing last week, Shinseki talked about the need to help struggling veterans, especially as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan wind down. 
A VA spokesman said Shinseki was unavailable to comment on how he felt about his son-in-law's office bringing the charges against Duvall. But when Heaphy was sworn in as U.S. attorney in 2009, Shinseki gave a short speech about public service and the calling to help veterans in need.
"Veterans for some unfortunate reason lead the country in homelessness, mental health problems, depression, substance abuse and suicides," Shinseki said at the ceremony. His job is to figure out why and to help them "have a better outcome than they currently have."
A judge in Roanoke is weighing whether to dismiss the charges against Duvall or to allow the case to proceed to trial. If that happens, veterans groups say they will pack the courtroom with uniformed veterans. 
Meanwhile, Duvall is doing much better, according to the court file. He sees a counselor and a psychiatrist. He has a new job as a machine operator in a metal shop and a new apartment.
In a posting on his Facebook page in August, he told his friends about his progress.
"Thank god I'm making decent money again," he wrote. "Last two years have been rough."

U.S. tells Yemenis it will boost aid, if terms are met

BYLINE: Karen DeYoung

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A06

LENGTH: 848 words

The Obama administration is prepared to increase assistance to Yemen if its new government moves quickly to restructure its military forces, stem official corruption and implement electoral reforms, a senior U.S. official said Monday.
In conversations with Yemeni and opposition officials, the administration has made clear that "we plan to step up [aid] if they meet our test," said John O. Brennan, President Obama's top counterterrorism adviser.
Brennan, speaking by telephone from Saudi Arabia after a two-day visit to Yemen, said that the presidential election Tuesday "is a very important step, but it is just a step." The Yemenis, he said, "recognize they have a lot of work before them."  
The vote is part of a brokered agreement with opposition forces in which President Ali Abdullah Saleh ceded power late last year to his vice president, Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi. Hadi, who will now be formally elected to the job as the only candidate on the ballot, has pledged to open a dialogue with opposition and secessionist forces in the north and south and prepare the country for full-fledged elections in two years.
But his most important pledge to the Obama administration is to continue counterterrorism cooperation against Yemen-based al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP. U.S. intelligence officials have said that the al-Qaeda branch poses the most active current threat to the United States and its allies. 
Since protests against Saleh's 33-year regime began early last year, the military has split  among those loyal to him and those supporting the political opposition. Although the street battles that racked Sanaa, the capital, have waned, the country remains divided among the various factions. 
Brennan and other U.S. officials have said that Yemen's domestic upheaval has not affected counterterrorism cooperation with specially trained Yemeni troops who work with the U.S. Joint Special Operations Command and the CIA in targeting AQAP leaders such as Anwar al-Awlaki, a Yemeni American killed in a U.S. drone attack there last year.
Over the past several months, however, AQAP and other militant groups have taken advantage of the political turmoil to seize territory in the southern part of the country, giving them a new territorial base from which to operate, and formed an alliance with elements of the al-Shabab militant group in nearby Somalia. Yemen's poorly equipped forces have made little progress in efforts to combat them.
Brennan said direct U.S. efforts in Yemen are aimed only at "hard-core members" of AQAP, numbering "in the dozens," who are involved in planning attacks against the United States. Several hundred other fighters, he said, have joined AQAP on the fringes from tribal and other groups in exchange for money.
Although the United States wants to "remove from the battlefield these several dozen," he said, it hopes that the Yemeni military, with increased logistical, equipment and training support, can form a better fighting force as it "disaggregates" those who have no ideological affinity for the insurgents. 
"We are looking at their needs," Brennan said of Yemen's military, including logistical support to "give them the ability to move forces to areas where al-Qaeda now has a strong foothold."
The administration set aside about $50 million in military assistance for Yemen last year, part of which was suspended when the country's armed forces split and troops began shooting at each other.
Although Saleh has stepped down, his son and other relatives head units of the armed forces that have battled over the past year with troops fighting under the banner of senior commanders who have defected from the government.
During his visit to Yemen, Brennan said, he told the commanders on all sides: "You can be in politics, or you can be in the military, but you can't do both. . . . If you want to be in the military, you have to step away from any political engagement."
The armed forces, he said, are personal "fiefdoms" of commanders. Among a number of reform proposals, U.S. military advisers have suggested centralizing the Yemeni military's salary structure to pay troops directly and prevent division commanders from pocketing the funds.
Saudi Arabia, Yemen's other major backer, has delivered the same message, Brennan said.  
U.S. economic assistance to Yemen for fiscal 2012 is $50 million, equal to the military assistance, with a similar amount projected for 2013.
The money is divided among projects in education, health, governance and economic growth - areas that are suffering in what is one of the region's poorest and least developed countries.
The administration has said that it will increase its contributions and ask other international donors to help in those projects, as well as improvements in electrical and water supplies.

Is carrying a gun the best way to protect your smartphone?

BYLINE: Courtland Milloy

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B01

LENGTH: 740 words

Here's a self-defense quiz.
Say you're sitting at a bus stop in the District, alone at night, when a suspicious person approaches. There have been more than 475 robberies in the city this year - a 70 percent increase over this time last year - and many involve the theft of electronic devices such as smartphones.
But your chances of being victimized are greatly reduced because: 
a. Your smartphone has a disabling device that makes it worthless to robbers.
b. More police officers have been assigned to street patrol.
c. You have a gun.
Police Chief Cathy Lanierbelieves the correct answers are (a) and (b). At a news conference last week, she said that a greater police presence has resulted in more than 100 arrests in robbery cases. In addition, police chiefs throughout the country will be lobbying the Federal Communications Commission, cellphone service providers and phone manufacturers to allow for the shutdown of stolen phones so that robbers can't resell them on the black market.
"What's going to stop this is stopping the profit," Lanier said.
Of course, if you're at that bus stop, you'd be more concerned about stopping a robber who will probably want more than just your cellphone. Some robbery victims have been beaten, sexually assaulted, stabbed and shot. Which brings us to a new report by the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank based in Washington. It's called: "Tough Targets: When Criminals Face Armed Resistance From Citizens." As the title suggests, the authors would probably choose (c) as the best answer to the self-defense question.
"If policymakers are truly interested in harm reduction, they should pause to consider how many crimes - murders, rapes, assaults, robberies - are thwarted each year by ordinary persons with guns," write Clayton E. Cramer, who teaches history at the College of Western Idaho, and David Burnett, director of public relations for Students for Concealed Carry.
Their report is based on roughly 5,000 news media accounts of self-defense with guns from October 2003 to November 2011. In making the case for carrying a concealed firearm, which is illegal in the District, the authors cite 285 news stories about defenders who had licenses to carry a gun, most of whom had used their weapons to successfully thwart street robberies.
In one story, on May 5, 2010, a St. Louis man was robbed at gunpoint. While the robber was going through his wallet, the man pulled his own gun and killed the assailant.
"Many people support gun control regulations because they are convinced that the average citizen is either incapable of using a gun in self-defense or will use the gun in a fit of anger over some petty matter," the authors write. "Those assumptions are false."
Nevertheless, even the most fervent gun advocates doubt that simply carrying a gun on the streets will guarantee your safety. George Lyon, a District resident and plaintiff in a lawsuit to legalize carrying a concealed firearm in the city, explained to me what could happen if someone wearing a gun in a holster was approached by robber wielding a knife.
"A person armed with a contact weapon like a club or a knife can travel about seven yards in two seconds," Lyon said. "And 1.5 seconds is about the minimum time it takes for a trained person to react, present a firearm and get off one or two shots. So, in all likelihood, unless you are very aware of your situation and looking for attack cues, you are going to get stabbed by the assailant. Having said that, I still believe a gun is a much better self-defense or emergency-rescue tool than a knife."
Back to the bus stop example, which comes from a D.C. police crime report on Feb. 14: A woman was sitting at a bus stop on 11th Street NW about 1:30 a.m. when she was robbed of a laptop, cellphone, books, cash and credit cards.
Was the woman at fault for being out that late, carrying so many valuable items? Can she really expect to sit at a bus stop at any hour and not be targeted by criminals?
Risk avoidance - add that to the multiple-choice self-defense quiz.

From foul to fair

DATELINE: VIERA, FLA.

VIERA, FLA. -  The traces of fresh blue and black ink peeked out from under the athletic tape wrapped around Wilson Ramos's left wrist. Ramos squatted behind a plate Tuesday morning, his first act during the first organized workout for Washington Nationals pitchers and catchers. Each time Ramos stabbed at a pitch, the ball nestled softly in his catcher's mitt, and the tattoo on his forearm moved, ever so slightly, closer toward his heart.
The tattoo, etched last week, contains a Bible verse in Spanish, Philippians 4:13, that Ramos translated as, "I put everything in Jesus, because he has my back." Emblazoned under the words is 11-11-11. On November 11, 2011, Venezuelan commandoes rescued Ramos from the men who approached him outside of his home, pointed guns at his head, threw him in a Chevy Captiva and held him captive for two days.  
"I feel like I'm living again," Ramos said. "I've got a new life."
Ramos came to spring training to start his second major league season and to further separate his ordeal from his career, to separate his recent past from his bright future. Ramos, 24, is one of the most promising pieces of the Nationals' foundation, and he wants to be defined by that and not by his kidnapping. Tuesday, he expressed gratitude that he had survived the abduction and confidence that it would not affect his baseball career. 
"I'm really, really happy to be here," Ramos said. 
Ramos wants to make baseball his sole focus, and he received his first spring assignment after the pitchers and catchers stretched: catching Stephen Strasburg's first side session of the camp. 
After 10 minutes, Strasburg had thrown his allotment of fastballs and change-ups. He walked to meet Ramos halfway between the plate and the mound, where they shook hands and half-hugged. 
Upon his arrival at spring training, the Nationals did not formally address the kidnapping with Ramos. They already received him in Washington in November, shortly after his rescue, and administered a full medical check-up. Tuesday, they wanted to let him move on. 
Manager Davey Johnson barely referenced Ramos's offseason to him. As Ramos caught pitches from Strasburg, Johnson sidled up to him and asked how much Ramos had played in the Venezuelan winter league following the kidnapping. A month and a half, Ramos responded. 
"That's indicative of, he's more comfortable getting on the field rather than talking to you guys about the kidnapping," Johnson said. "He wanted to get back in there and go play. It's over with. And I'm sure it's over with him.
"He's dealt with that good. He's in a good frame of mind. We were all scared to death, but I'm not one that deals too much in the past. I deal in the present. As far as I'm concerned, it's history."
Ramos did not hit well at first in Venezuela, but by the end he helped the Aragua Tigres win their playoff series. It was an important step in recovering. For Ramos, playing in Venezuela after the kidnapping - which he did under the protection of armed guards - allowed him a degree of mental stability. 
"I tried to clear my mind with baseball," Ramos said. "If I stayed in my house, I was thinking too much."
In a country plagued by crime and kidnappings, Ramos became the first major league player to be abducted. The challenge of returning to professional baseball after such an episode, performing under high pressure before thousands and thousands, has no precedent.
In one recent winter, Nationals backup catcher Jesus Flores, also Venezuelan, was carjacked at gunpoint in Venezuela. "I couldn't play well for a week or two weeks," Flores said. "His situation was harder, more difficult. It was more mental." 
Flores went home to play winter ball this year. Even before Ramos's kidnapping, Flores traveled with a bodyguard. 
"It doesn't mean that you're going to be protected," Flores said. "I'm not really going out or doing too much on the street because of the situation. 
"It could happen to anybody. The security is very bad. It's a very dangerous country right now. Wilson, I thought that he wasn't going to be alive after that situation. We were thinking the worst. We were thinking the worst."
After two harrowing days, Ramos emerged, safe and unharmed. His life had changed forever, and not only in bad ways. His family, as families do, had grown divided before the kidnappers snatched him. The incident united his family again, he said, and his brother, sister and mother are attaining visas to visit him.
Ramos's teammates this weekend greeted him with hugs and smiles. They told him how great it was to see him - "everybody is telling me that," Ramos said - but they do not directly mention the kidnapping. 
"They know I don't want to talk about that," Ramos said. "I just want to concentrate on baseball and help my team." 
When he jogged across a matrix of backfields Tuesday morning, Ramos inserted another layer between him and his kidnapping. During a drill designed to improve framing pitches, Ramos dropped a ball. Bullpen coach Nilson Robledo hollered, "Good glove!"
"Thank you, Robledo," Ramos said, laughing.
"Need some bubblegum on there," bullpen coach Jim Lett teased. 
Ramos finished the workout with batting practice. He focused on shortening the path of his swing, as Johnson had instructed. "He looked good doing it," Johnson said. After Ramos sprayed easy line drives, he walked out of the batting cage and packed his gear. 
Ramos hopped on the rear of a golf cart for the ride back to the clubhouse. He chuckled as he drove by two familiar faces. When Ramos stopped laughing, he looked to his left, at an empty, sun-splashed baseball diamond. The smile stayed on his face.

15,000 die annually crossing rail tracks
About 15,000 people die every year trying to cross the tracks of India's mammoth rail network, a "massacre" that a government committee said was being ignored by railway authorities.
The safety panel said new bridges and overpasses are urgently needed, but it noted that previous recommendations to make the world's fourth-largest railway system safer had been ignored. Its report said railway officials were unwilling to view the deaths of people hit while crossing tracks as train accidents.
Most of the deaths occur at unmanned railroad crossings, said the report, released over the weekend. About 6,000 people die on Mumbai's crowded suburban rail network alone. An additional 1,000 people die when they fall from crowded coaches, when trains collide or when coaches derail, the panel said.

Top leaders urgedto stop infighting
Foreign diplomats,  business leaders and top Haitian politicians have been scrambling this week to prevent a confrontation that could lead to the ouster of Prime Minister Garry Conille just four months after he took office.
All have been urging lawmakers and advisers close to both Conille and President Michel Martelly to stop the infighting that threatens to leave Haiti without a functioning government just as the post-quake country appears to be gaining ground.
The appeals come on the heels of last week's public plea by Susan E. Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, for leaders to put their country's interests above their own.
Conille, a former U.N. official, and Martelly have been at loggerheads over nationality issues, an investigation of $300 million in post-quake contracts and who controls government ministers. Conille is under pressure to resign or face a no-confidence vote.

Chavez to undergo more surgery
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said Tuesday that doctors in Cuba have found a new lesion in the area where he had cancer surgery last year and that he will require surgery.
"It is a small lesion of about two centimeters [less than one inch] in diameter, very clearly visible," he told state television.
The announcement throws new uncertainty over the country's politics because the socialist leader is seeking reelection this year, hoping to extend his more than 13 years in power. He did not say when he would undergo the surgery, other than "in the coming days."
Chavez has assured Venezuelans that he is in fine shape to gain what would be his third reelection in an Oct. 7 contest against opposition candidate Henrique Capriles.

Lawyer says client has been charged in Breyer robbery: A lawyer says he will enter a plea of not guilty for a man charged in the robbery of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Stephen G. Breyer on the Caribbean island of Nevis. Attorney Henry Browne says Vedel K. Browne has been charged with aggravated robbery and could get up to 25 years in prison. Police in St. Kitts and Nevis said Vedel Browne is a "person of interest" in the case but have not described his alleged involvement in the Feb. 9 robbery at Breyer's vacation home. A machete-wielding robber took $1,000.
Pakistan seeks Musharraf's arrest: Pakistan will ask Interpol to arrest former Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf for his failure to prevent the assassination of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, the interior minister said Tuesday. Rehman Malik said the government is seeking Musharraf's arrest because he allegedly failed to provide adequate security for Bhutto, who was killed in a gun and bomb attack in 2007.
Honduran prison fire accidental, official says: The Honduran government said Tuesday that a dropped cigarette may have set off the worst prison fire in a century as it announced that another death from the Feb. 14 blaze had brought the toll to 360. Chief prosecutor Luis Alberto Rubi said results of the initial investigation show that the fire was accidental, despite earlier reports that a mattress was set ablaze by an angry inmate or by other prisoners in a fight. Others asserted that the fire was set deliberately by guards.

Trial in string of 2010 killings starts

BYLINE: Keith L. Alexander

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B03

LENGTH: 789 words

The arrest and release of a 14-year-old wrongly accused of a role in a deadly 2010 drive-by shooting has resurfaced as an element of the defense strategy for five men charged in that and other shootings. In court Tuesday, prosecutors attempted to preempt the argument, calling that arrest an "honest mistake."
The trial of the five - Orlando Carter, 22; his brother, Sanquan Carter, 21; Jeffrey D. Best, 23; Robert Bost, 23; and Lamar Williams, 23 - began Tuesday in D.C. Superior Court. In previous hearings, defense attorneys had signaled the intention to cast doubt on prosecutors' evidence and the credibility of a key witness who has already pleaded guilty to murder. 
The five men face first-degree murder, conspiracy, weapons and other charges in connection with a series of shootings in March 2010 that left five dead. If convicted, they could spend the rest of their lives in prison.
After a March 30 drive-by shooting that killed three, the teen was charged with more than 40 counts, including first-degree murder. A month later, police dropped those charges after another man - Nathaniel Simms, 28 - admitted to a role in the shootings, pleading guilty to five counts of second-degree murder and agreeing to cooperate with authorities. He has been held in protective custody.
During a more than three-hour opening statement Tuesday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Brittin said authorities "made an honest mistake" when they accused the teen of driving a minivan used in the shooting in the 4000 block of South Capitol Street.

Defense doubts witnesses
Defense attorneys plan to argue that Simms - as well as many of the other approximately 100 witnesses  prosecutors may call to the stand - have falsely implicated their clients in hopes of currying favor from the government in their own cases.
"Simms is lying," Michael O'Keefe, Best's attorney, said during his opening statement. "There's a lot of evidence of guilt by association."
Prosecutors say their evidence also includes DNA, cellphone records and fingerprints.
Prosecutors saythe string of shootingsbegan after Sanquan Carter attended a party on March 22. When he found his gold-colored bracelet was missing, authorities say, he accused other party guests of stealing it. Prosecutors say he then called his older brother Orlando, who, along with Simms, Best and Williams, drove to the party. The Carter brothers and Best fired dozens of bullets into the crowd with guns Williams provided, according to prosecutors.
Jordan Howe, 20, was killed in that shooting. Two others were injured.
Howe's friends shot and injured Orlando Carter the next day in an act of retaliation, prosecutors say.
On March 30, they say, Orlando Carter organized his friends again. He, Best, Bost and Simms allegedly shot and killed Tavon Nelson, 17, while trying to steal a gun they wanted for another shooting.
Minutes later, they opened fire on a crowd on South Capitol Street - it included many who had attended Howe's funeral earlier that day - with an AK-47-style assault weapon and a .45-caliber semiautomatic pistol, prosecutors say.
Three people who had attended the funeral were killed: Brishell "Bri" Jones, 16, DaVaughn Boyd, 19, and William Jones III, 19. William and Brishell Jones were not related. Six were hurt. None was associated with the shooting of Orlando Carter.

'A piece of costume jewelry'
"All of this violence over a piece of costume jewelry," Brittin said during his statement, holding up the bracelet adorned with fake diamonds. 
Brittin said a witness will testify that Sanquan Carter escorted a woman wearing the bracelet out of the party but did not realize it.
Sanquan Carter's attorney, Chris Roberts, said his client was not involved in the March 22 shooting.
"This case is not about a bracelet and should not be about Sanquan Carter," Roberts said. Carter was arrested two days after the shooting that killed Howe and is not connected to the March 30 drive-by shootings.
"This case will be very much about the victims," Brittin said. "What happens when rules of law are ignored and individuals take the law into their own hands."
The trial is expected to last about three months. During four days of jury selection, 12 jurors and five alternates were picked. Judge Ronna Beck removed two jurors from the trial Tuesday, one for personal reasons that were were not disclosed publicly and the other because he knew Howe's mother.
Beck later said she was "concerned" about losing two jurors so early in the trial.

What happened in Iraq?

BYLINE: David Montgomery

SECTION: STYLE; Pg. C01

LENGTH: 2173 words

On July 12, 2007, during a long, hot mission, American soldiers searched houses in a ruined maze of a neighborhood in east Baghdad. The largely routine effort came to a violent conclusion: An Apache helicopter circling overhead spotted several men carrying weapons. The chopper stalked the targets, then opened fire. Among the 11 killed were a Reuters photographer and his driver. Among the wounded were two young children.
The Army investigated. No one was publicly found at fault. 
And no man recalls things the same. Each member of Bravo Company of the 2-16 - Second Battalion, Sixteenth Infantry Regiment of the Fourth Infantry Brigade Combat Team, First Infantry Division - played a slightly different role, in different locations, affording various perspectives. They have reached two broad, opposite conclusions about what happened that day. 
Ethan McCord - who says he scooped up the children - and at least one of his comrades say the incident revealed the bankrupt brutality of the war. Michael Bailey - a medic who treated some of the wounded Iraqis - and an apparently larger number of 2-16 veterans say it showed soldiers acting honorably amid the inevitable horror of war.
The two views might have remained frozen there, to be rehashed into old age in the twilight of VFW posts - except that unlike so many fading war stories, this one comes with a DVD.
First, a classified video of the action as seen from the Apache was released by WikiLeaks in April 2010. Now a 22-minute documentary of the "Incident in New Baghdad" by director James Spione is up for an Academy Award at the Oscar ceremony Sunday.
Yet for all the documentary evidence - video doesn't lie, does it? - collective truth remains elusive. Nobody, including the Pentagon, disputes the authenticity of the video. What it means, however - and what happened before, what happened after, what were the intentions of the actors - those are different questions.
Rather than clearing things up for the men who were there, if anything, the politically motivated dissemination of the video - which WikiLeaks called "Collateral Murder" - dug the two camps more deeply into their positions. The prospect of an Oscar for "Incident in New Baghdad" - based on the video and featuring McCord's take on events - has driven defenders of the 2-16's honor to a furious activism of their own.
"We're angry at McCord, because he's making us out to be heartless killers," says Bailey, who created a Facebook page for 2-16 vets to challenge McCord and the documentary. "He's the only man who's been given a microphone. His opinion of the war is the only one that's been carried, and his opinion of his fellow solders is not one that people should take so much to heart."
McCord does not fault his comrades, although he says troops killed civilians "every day" in Iraq because of the way the war was fought, as dictated by politicians and superior officers. 
"You can't blame soldiers for being put in this situation," McCord says. "Blaming soldiers is like slapping a child because his mother is ugly. This is what we're trained to do."
July 12, 2007, was not even the worst day in Iraq for members of the 2-16. 
For one thing, none in the battalion were killed. Two had been killed in the weeks leading up to the house-search mission. Bailey endures the psychic pain of fellow soldier Andre Craig lying mortally wounded in his arms June 25. McCord, in honor of the same loss, tattooed images of Craig's dog tags on his arm.
But the video and documentary have made July 12 perhaps the unit's most high-profile day - and the most ambiguous. (The day also merits a chapter http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/14/AR2009091403262.htmlin http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/11/AR2009091102405.html"The Good Soldiers," Washington Post reporter David Finkel's 2009 book about the 2-16.) 
"If you watched just the video, you wouldn't know we'd been receiving fire all day," Bailey says. "You wouldn't know the mortars platoon came close to losing someone. And you wouldn't know the tactics of [the insurgents] Jaish al Mahdi. That's the problem with this whole incident. There's no way you can put it into context, unless you . . . make it a movie that's 'War and Peace' and 12 hours long."
After the guns fall silent, and the videos are replayed and the stories retold, it becomes a war over context. 
"I'm not here to please the left and I'm not hear to please the right," McCord says in an interview. "I'm here to provide context. If you don't like it, I'm sorry. That's my truth. I'm providing what I saw, what I felt."
A little context, then, from those on the ground, on the screen and behind the cameras.
McCord, now 35, was older than most of the recruits in the 2-16. He had served in the Navy. He says he joined because he wanted to be part of the "good cause" to "help the Iraqi people."
Bailey, now 28, had served a previous tour in northern Iraq and had the strong sense he was making a positive difference in Iraqi lives. 
July 12 gets off to an unnerving start before dawn, with a few enemy rounds flying over the exposed troops' heads as they are preparing to leave their base. 
The mission is to flood a zone where insurgents have been especially active and the 2-16 has suffered numerous recent casualties. The soldiers reach the neighborhood and settle into a rhythm of searching houses. They confiscate some weapons and detain some suspects. Someone snaps a picture of a smiling McCord and his buddy Anthony Merlino playing with a goat. 
"All of a sudden, we heard gunfire from a rooftop," Merlino recalls. "At one point, an RPG [rocket-propelled grenade] just misses us."
The troops advance house by house, rooftop by rooftop, but whoever was shooting at them apparently slips away. 
Two Apaches from another unit circle overhead. Their 30mm automatic cannons are poised, their video cameras and voice recorders are on.
One Apache crew spots men carrying what appear to be weapons. Later, a grenade launcher and at least one AK-47 will be found at the scene. But two other devices the crew takes for weapons are actually cameras with long lenses carried by Reuters photographer Namir Noor-Eldeen, 22, and driver Saeed Chmagh, 40. 
The Apache crew gets permission to open fire from members of the 2-16 on the ground, according to radio chatter captured on the video.
"Light 'em all up," says one crew member.
A gunner fires several bursts of the automatic cannon. The men jerk and crumple and disappear in a cloud of dust. 
"Oh yeah, look at those dead b-------."
"Good shootin'."
"Thank you."
The video shows a van pulling up to a wounded man, as if to take him away.
The Apache radios to the 2-16 that the van is "possibly picking up bodies and weapons" and requests permission to shoot again. Granted. 
"Right through the windshield." 
"I think we whacked 'em all."
Members of the 2-16 are seen in the video, advancing to secure the area. 
One of the first to look in the front of the van is Merlino, according to Merlino and McCord. The video doesn't show the van's interior. Merlino sees the driver is dead. A boy next to him looks dead. Another front-seat passenger is alive.
"I saw the little girl," Merlino recalls. "It was something I'll never forget. She wasn't screaming, she wasn't yelling; she was looking down. She looks up at me with the whitest eyes I've ever seen. Snow white. And her face was covered in blood."
Merlino remembers feeling on the verge of vomiting as he is ordered away from the van to secure the area. 
McCord looks in the van and, he recalls, gathers the girl into his arms. She appears about 4. He carries her to a house where medic Ryan Searles starts treating her. McCord recalls picking glass off her face and hair and washing away blood with water. 
This moment is a turning point for McCord, when his growing doubts about the war begin to crystallize. His recollection of this moment is the crux of the documentary.
"I almost felt as if I were holding my own child," he says in the film. "The whole time, I'm fighting back tears. . . . Things from that day changed for me. I no longer felt I was doing good in Iraq."
Searles, now a security contractor in San Antonio, remembers those moments differently.
McCord, Searles says, never held the girl. "I pulled her out of the van. McCord was never in the house."
In an interview, McCord insists on the veracity of his account - which he has told consistently many times over the years. Both he and Searles sound sincere and certain.
The video records someone on the ground reporting a child with a belly wound who needs to be evacuated.
"Ah damn. Oh well," says a voice in the chopper.
"Well, it's their fault for bringing their kids into a battle."
"That's right."
Searles says he hustled the girl to a Bradley Fighting Vehicle for evacuation. 
McCord recalls looking back inside the van and seeing the boy take a labored breath. The child appears about 7. McCord pulls him out of the van and runs him to the Bradley. 
 Searles insists it was he who collected the boy from McCord and carried him to the Bradley. The medic treated both children on the way to a hospital. 
When soldiers disagree on their own actions, does it affect the meaning of the incident? From the sky, the Apache camera captured it all. But the video is little help. Soldiers are seen trotting gingerly with the children in their arms. It's all but impossible to tell which soldiers. 
Bailey arrives on the scene just as the Bradley is departing. He starts treating two gravely wounded adults, one of whom is found lying on top of a rocket-propelled grenade launcher with a grenade in the tube.
According to the documentary, the children survived. Their names are Duaa and Sajad Mutashar, and they live with their mother and uncle in Baghdad.
After an investigation, which the Army did not make public, and an initial burst of media attention, the incident seemed over, consigned to the private theater of each man's psyche. 
But when the WikiLeaks video burst on the public scene, the incident acquired a sensational afterlife. Members of the 2-16 had the surreal experience of seeing themselves in the washed-out black-and-white of the Apache's camera. 
McCord and Josh Stieber, another former member of the 2-16 who was not part of the action that day, wrote an "open letter of reconciliation and responsibility to the Iraqi people." 
McCord began speaking and writing publicly against the war, highlighting the mental toll on the troops. 
Bailey, Merlino and Searles followed his comments on the Internet but didn't speak publicly until now. Facebook users have posted threatening messages against McCord.
Merlino, who says he remains haunted by the girl's white eyes and bloody face, does not see an indictment of the American mission in her suffering. 
"We had no idea there were children there. We didn't know there were journalists there," Merlino says. "I don't know what people in America think war is, but it doesn't come in pretty little boxes. . . . I'm proud of what we did. We helped that area. We helped the people. And we did our jobs honorably." 
Searles asks: "Do civilians die during war? Yes. It's gonna happen. Do we purposely kill them? No. Ethan, I guess, couldn't handle it. He's trying to make [the incident] antiwar and we were these horrible people - which we weren't."
McCord's former comrades interviewed for this article had not seen the documentary because it wasn't widely available until this month. However, McCord's recollections and conclusions in the documentary are consistent with what he has been saying since the WikiLeaks video came out.
"I'm challenging people's self-justification for their actions in Iraq," McCord says in an interview. "Because I cannot self-justify why I was there."
The film has won prizes at several film festivals. Director Spione says he intends to make a feature-length work including many perspectives - including McCord's - on the incident.
The firing on the van troubles McCord the most. 
 "I didn't shoot those children, and I didn't shoot their father or those men on the ground," he says in the documentary. "But I am a part of that system that killed those people. And I think every American is a part of that system."
Bailey, who studies history and international relations at West Virginia University, casts the fate of the van in a different light.
"Any vehicle that comes on to an active incident like that is already suspicious from the get-go," he says. "Maybe it's humanitarian, maybe it's not. You don't have time to assess that.  . . . It's extremely possible that a bunch of militia could have jumped out of that van and continued the engagement.
"You have people who are doing a difficult job at a difficult time, and they're doing the best they can."
McCord and Bailey agree on one thing: They don't think the American public has bothered to learn the full reality of the Iraq war. McCord thinks that the knowledge would make more people oppose the war. Bailey is convinced that it would increase respect for the troops.

At least he didn't say 'another Vietnam'

BYLINE: Al Kamen

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A13

LENGTH: 1141 words

Some analogies are perhaps best avoided.
Take, for example, Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper's appearance last week before the Senate Armed Services Committee.
Committee ChairmanCarl Levin(D- Mich.) told Clapper he was "concerned by recent news reports that the latest National Intelligence Estimate, or NIE, reflects a difference of views between the intelligence community and our military commanders over the security situation in Afghanistan."
The dissenting views were signed by Gen. John R. Allen, head of U.S. forces there; Ambassador Ryan Crocker; Gen. James Mattis, head of the Central Command; and Adm. James G. Stavridis, the supreme allied commander in Europe - not exactly a group you want to trifle with.
Are the news reports accurate? Levin asked. 
Well, yes, Clapper said, those officials "took issue with the NIE on three counts having to do with the force structure, didn't feel that we gave sufficient weight to Pakistan and its impact as a safe haven and generally felt that the NIE was pessimistic" about the situation in Afghanistan and "the prospects for post-2014," when troops are to withdraw. 
Clapper tried to ease Levin's concerns. "If you'll forgive a little history, sir," he began. "I served as an analyst briefer for General Westmoreland in Vietnam in 1966." Clapper said he learned there that it's typical that the "operational commanders sometimes don't agree" with the intelligence team's assessment of their efforts.
Gen. William Westmoreland, we recall, was notorious for predicting victory in Vietnam, telling an enthusiastic Congress in 1967 that, with time, "we will prevail in Vietnam over the Communist aggressor."
Maybe might want to leave comparisons to Westmoreland out of it? Not a confidence-booster, after all. 

The best defense . . . 
Press-bashing is an important staple of any candidate's repertoire, in part because it's so easy and always useful. 
Former House speaker Newt Gingrich made excellent use of it when, in a televised debate, he went after CNN's John Kingfor daring to ask about his second wife. Some say it may have givenGingrich the boost to win the South Carolina primary.
More recently, former senator Rick Santorum used the "double standard" feint to excellent effect to deflect criticism of a backer's now-infamous "aspirin between her legs" observation on women and contraception.
"Look, this is what you guys do," he told CBS News's Charlie Rose. "You don't do this with President Obama. In fact, with President Obama, you . . . defended him" after the Rev. Jeremiah Wright's pyrotechnic sermons were revealed, he said.
"It's a double standard, this is what you're pulling off," he said, "and I'm going to call you on it." Seemed to work well.
We recall the Rev. Wright controversy was huge newsat the time, and the constant media pounding forced Obama to make a big speech on the issue, but whatever. 
Pols would do well to be guided by the master on handling the media, President Richard M. Nixon.
Our colleague Karen Tumulty reminds us of a June 2, 1971, memorandum Nixon wrote to his chief of staff Bob Haldeman, before Haldeman's Watergate resignation.
"I hope you will note the next time you are talking to [press secretary Ron Ziegler and other aides] that in this first press conference . . . after the White House Correspondents Dinner, where I played the 'good sport' role, the reporters were considerably more bad-mannered and vicious than usual. This bears out my theory that treating them with considerably more contempt is in the long run a more productive policy."
Advice to be pinned on the wall of everyone who ever runs for office.

Just don't 'reply all'
Much like the airing of dirty laundry, the public release of once-private e-mails can be embarrassing. 
In messages revealed as part of the investigation into the Justice Department's "Fast and Furious" operation - and brought to our attention by our eagle-eyed colleague Sari Horwitz - Arizona's former U.S. attorney called the department's public affairs officials "chuckleheads" for criticizing a news release from his office and then took a veiled dig at Michelle Obama's obesity campaign. 
According to the electronic missives, Dennis Burke, who has since resigned, had approved a January news release in which his office described "Mexican drug lords . . . shopping for war weapons in Arizona." In a quote from the release, the head of the state's field division used the phrase "the ongoing Mexican drug war." That phraseology, apparently, didn't sit well with Washington. 
"OPA didn't like me using 'war,' " Burke complained in an e-mail to U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman of New Jersey. "30,000 people are dead in Mexico. Sounds like war to me."
Then Burke referred to the anti-obesity campaign championed by the first lady. "Ok to have a 'War on Obesity' but not regarding Mexico," the e-mail said. 
In a similar e-mail to Preet Bharara, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, Burke expressed frustration at the public affairs shop's criticism. "So the chuckleheads at DoJ OPA called my office to complain that I used the word 'war' about the current circumstances in Mexico," he wrote. 
Bharara responded with sympathetic solidarity. "Don't listen to them," he replied in an e-mail. "Thanks for the heads up, because now I will use 'war' constantly."
The electronic exchanges were made public after Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.),chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, subpoenaed the Justice Department to provide them as part of his panel's probe into Fast and Furious.
This wasn't Burke's first brush with cringe-inducing e-mails. Messages contained in a previous batch of records released as part of the probe reportedly show Burke calling staffers for Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) "willing stooges for the Gun Lobby."

Personnel notes
We're hearing that Tony West, assistant attorney general in the Justice Department's civil division, is in line to fill the shoes of Associate Attorney General Tom Perrelli, the department's No. 3 official. Perrelli announced a few weeks ago that he would leave his post in March.
It's not a done deal, but we've heard the phrase "almost certain." 
No word yet on who would replace West. 
In other Justice Department revolving-door news, Michael DuBose, former chief of the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, has joined the Kroll consulting firm. DuBose is managing director and leader of the cyber-investigations practice for the company, which specializes in risk management. 
Elsewhere, the White House has nominated Carlos Pascual to be assistant secretary for energy resources at the State Department. Pascual is a former ambassador to Mexico and serves as special envoy and coordinator for international energy affairs.

Profiting in Afghanistan

The U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command on Feb. 1 approved a $330 million five-month extension on a five-year contract.
That contract now totals $2.3 billion and provides more than 8,000 interpreters working for U.S. forces at 200 sites in Afghanistan.
The Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM) contract extension is another reminder of the varied expenses of this war and how some people are profiting. 
In Columbus, Ohio, in 2004, a police officer and two Special Forces reservists who spoke Arabic started Mission Essential Personnel (MEP). The goal was to provide language and security training to the U.S. government and corporations focused on the Middle East.
MEP really began to grow in 2005 with a 30-month State Department contract for interpreters and security services at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. But the big breakthrough came in 2007, when MEP, as a "small business," won the contract that INSCOM extended last week.
The original ceiling was to be $703 million, but as more troops kept coming, the ceiling rose by $78.5 million in March 2010 and by $679 million in May 2010. By last March there was an additional $525 million.
The Army wanted to put out a new contract for competition in late 2010, but a series of appeals and threatened court actions by prospective bidders delayed the final offering. The result was the latest extension for MEP.
Meanwhile, as the Army said in its justification document, "the need for linguists in theater evolves on a daily basis while remaining critical to current and future operations."
Afghanistan's population is spread out, with a high illiteracy rate and "dozens of languages and dialects." The number of linguists needed by U.S. troops far "exceeded the number of locals that could take jobs," according to the Army.
In addition, there are three types of interpreters needed - locals and others who have no security clearances; U.S. citizens who have secret clearances; and U.S. citizens with top-secret clearances and "capable of supporting continuous operations on a 24/7 basis in austere/hostile locations throughout Afghanistan," according to the Army.
Salaries can range from as low as $900 a month for an Afghan to $200,000 or more a year for an American working at forward operating positions. It is a dangerous business, and even more so for Afghans, who become special targets for the Taliban.
MEP in September said that over the years 73 of its employees had been killed, with 312 injured and 10 missing.
In January 2010, one of its interpreters, Nasir Ahmad Ahmadi, went on a rampage and killed two U.S. soldiers at a fire base and wounded another. Ahmadi, a 23-year-old Afghan who had immigrated to the United States in 2009, was in turn fatally shot by a U.S. Army sergeant.
A wrongful-death lawsuit was filed last year against MEP by relatives of the dead soldiers who claimed that Ahmadi had been hired without proper vetting. The company said that Ahmadi had been thoroughly vetted and that his actions were "entirely unforeseeable." The case is pending.
Meanwhile, MEP is rising on Washington Technology's list of the 100 biggest defense contractors. It was No. 42 last year, up from No. 62 in 2010. The company was even mentioned at a July 26, 2010, hearing of the Commission on Wartime Contracting.
Former representative Christopher Shays (R-Conn.), co-chairman of the panel, noted that MEP got its interpreter contract increased without competition. Although Shays said that MEP had received at that point more than a billion dollars and "was a great American success story," he added that it hadn't had any audits. "Whatever your costs are, you get something plus," he said, meaning that the company gets a fee and whatever its operating costs are.
MEP's then-chief executive Chris Taylor responded that the Defense Department's auditors were at the company's offices and that the firm was current on its invoices to the Army.
One element in MEP's growth that imitates what other big defense contractors have done is to create a "board of advisers" and stock it with former government officials.
Among the current advisory board members are retired Adm. Eric T. Olson, former head of the U.S. Special Operations Command; Michael Chertoff, former secretary of homeland security; John Nagl, president of the Center for a New American Security and a member of the Defense Policy Board; and David Kilcullen, senior counterinsurgency adviser to Gen. David H. Petraeus during the 2007 surge and adviser to the Afghanistan International Security Assistance Force in 2009 and 2010.
According to the Army, there are five applicants for the new Afghanistan interpreter contract, which is scheduled to run for another five years, from 2012 to 2017. MEP is one of the bidders. 
It will be interesting to see who wins.

'Absolutely horrific'

BYLINE: Editorial Board

SECTION: EDITORIAL COPY; Pg. A16

LENGTH: 531 words

"I WATCHED a little baby die today. Absolutely horrific. There is just shells, rockets and tank fire pouring into civilian areas of this city, and it is just unrelenting." Thus reported Marie Colvin, an American journalist of extraordinary courage and integrity, to the BBC on Tuesday from the Syrian city of Homs. On Wednesday she was dead, killed along with the French photographer Remi Ochlik, reportedly by rocket fire.  
The death of Ms. Colvin, who covered wars around the world for Britain's Sunday Times, was a tragic loss for Western journalism. It followed by days the death of another great reporter seeking to cover the slaughter in Syria, Anthony Shadid of the New York Times - a two-time Pulitzer Prize winner for The Post.
If they serve any purpose, these terrible blows to our profession should call attention to what Ms. Colvin was witnessing when she died: the "absolutely sickening" assault by Bashar al-Assad's troops on the Homs neighborhood of Baba Amr - where an act of mass murder is underway. "The Syrian Army," she told CNN on Tuesday, "is simply shelling a city of cold, starving civilians."
The siege of Baba Amr, which houses 28,000 people, began on Feb. 4. According to a riveting dispatchby Ms. Colvin published last weekend in the Sunday Times, she sneaked into the city on a smugglers' route, "climbing over walls in the dark and slipping into muddy trenches." She was working out of a makeshift news center in a building whose top floor, she reported, had already been blown off by artillery fire. The site may have been targeted by regime forces tracking satellite telephones; two other foreign journalists were reported wounded in the attack.
Here is how Ms. Colvin described Homs: "It is a city of the cold and hungry, echoing to exploding shells and bursts of gunfire. There are no telephones, and the electricity has been cut off. Few homes have diesel for the tin stoves they rely on for heat in the coldest winter that anyone can remember. . . . The scale of human tragedy in the city is immense. The inhabitants are living in terror. Almost every family seems to have suffered the death or injury of a loved one."
Ms. Colvin reported that regime forces had "dug a huge trench around" the Baba Amr district "and let virtually no one in or out." Snipers posted on rooftops "shoot any civilian who comes into their sights." And the worst may be yet to come: "About 5,000 Syrian soldiers are believed to be on the outskirts of Baba Amr, and [opposition forces] received reports . . . that they were preparing a ground assault. The residents dread the outcome."
In her final interview with the BBC, Ms. Colvin, who covered the wars in the Balkans during the 1990s, cited the massacre of Srebrenica, where Serb troops killed thousands of civilians; she recalled the international investigations that followed and the solemn "vows to never let it happen again."
What Ms. Colvin was trying to tell the world is that it is happening again, in Baba Amr. "No one can understand how the international community can let this happen," she said. If the Western nations and Syria's neighbors continue to stand by passively, Ms. Colvin's words will come back to haunt them.

Donald is a Match Play first-round loser

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. D02

LENGTH: 768 words

Luke Donald became only the third No. 1 seed to lose in the opening round of the Match Play Championship.
Ernie Els built an early lead and never let go in a 5-and-4 victory Wednesday in Marana, Ariz.
Donald, who never trailed in any of the six matches he won to capture the title at last year's event, joins Tiger Woods in 2002 and Steve Stricker in 2010 as the only top seeds to fail to get out of the opening round. 
Woods barely won his opening match Wednesday. He trailed Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano by one hole until winning the 15th and 16th, then holed an eight-foot par putt on the 18th hole to avoid going into extra holes.
It was the fourth time Woods was taken to the 18th hole in the opening round of this fickle event. He next plays Nick Watney, who had no trouble beating British Open champion Darren Clarke.
Dustin Johnson made the day's greatest escape, beating Jim Furyk in 20 holes. Ryo Ishikawa also rallied late to beat Riviera winner Bill Haas.

Pro Basketball
Former NBA player Javaris Crittenton is back in jail. 
Out on bond on charges that he killed a woman in an August drive-by shooting in south Atlanta, authorities say he was jailed Wednesday in Riverdale, Ga., after being pulled over for speeding and refusing to get out of his Porsche. . . . 
Atlanta Hawks guard Joe Johnson will miss All-Star Weekend in Orlando because of tendinitis in his left knee. NBA Commissioner David Stern picked Boston Celtics guard Rajon Rondo to replace Johnson in the All-Star Game this weekend, passing over Atlanta forward Josh Smith.
Oklahoma City's Kevin Durant will take Johnson's place in the three-point contest.
Johnson is also skipping the Hawks' last two games before the break, at New York on Wednesday night and a home game against Orlando on Thursday night.. . . .
New Jersey Nets forward Shawne Williams had surgery to repair an old fracture and remove two small bone fragments in his left foot. He will miss the rest of the season. . . .
The Washington Mystics signed veteran guard Dominique Canty. Canty has averaged 7.4 points, 2.6 rebounds and 2.8 assists per game during her 13-year WNBA career.

Soccer
Unheralded Basel added Bayern Munich to its list of Champions League conquests, beating the four-time European champions, 1-0, in the first leg of the second round.
Having beaten Manchester United in the group stage, Basel twice hit the frame of the goal before substitute Valentin Stocker scored in the 86th minute on a shot through goalkeeper Manuel Neuer's legs.
Marseille also scored late for a 1-0 home win over Inter Milan, with Andre Ayew connecting in the third minute of injury time.

Colleges
Temple and the Big East are talking about the Owls rejoining the conference as soon as next season.
Mid-American Conference Commissioner Jon A. Steinbrecher said in a statement that his league is "aware that Temple has been in discussions with the Big East regarding membership."
A person familiar with the talks said the school and the Big East are trying to negotiate a deal that could have Temple in the league for all sports by next season. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks are  ongoing.
Temple played in the Big East in football only from 1991 to 2004, but was forced out of the league. It played as a football independent and eventually landed in the MAC in 2007. The Owls' other sports programs, including men's and women's basketball, are in the Atlantic 10. . . .
Boise State will remain in the Mountain West for the 2012-13 athletic seasons after considering an early move for its football program to the Big East. The school announced that it was not "fiscally responsible" to move its football program a year earlier than scheduled. . . .
Connecticut men's basketball Coach Jim Calhoun will undergo surgery next week to address a lower back condition and he will miss the Huskies' next two games. The university said the status of the Hall of Fame coach, who has been on a medical leave of absence since Feb. 3, will then be evaluated on "a day-to-day basis."

Hockey
The Carolina Hurricanes agreed to a four-year, $19 million extension with forward Tuomo Ruutu. He would've been an unrestricted free agent after this season. Ruutu, 29, has 17 goals and 30 points in 57 games. . . .
The Columbus Blue Jackets traded center Antoine Vermette to the Phoenix Coyotes for two draft picks and goaltender Curtis McElhinney.
The deal would give Columbus a second-round pick in the 2012 draft and a fifth-round pick in 2013. The fifth-round pick will become a fourth rounder if the Coyotes make the playoffs this season and win their first-round series.

A suicidal vet's plight

BYLINE: Editorial Board

SECTION: EDITORIAL COPY; Pg. A16

LENGTH: 500 words

LIKE SO MANY PEOPLE, including too many veterans in this country, Sean Duvall found himself incapacitated by the illness of depression.
Mr. Duvall's part-time job as a cook on the Virginia Tech campus had come to an end and, with it, the means to pay for his apartment. On June 1, the 45-year-old left his home and began walking the streets of Blacksburg. In his backpack: a cellphone, a letter to his family and an eight-inch pipe he had designed to shoot one bullet when slammed against a wall. That bullet, Mr. Duvall thought, would bring an end to his misery. 
Fortunately, Mr. Duvall, who enlisted in the Navy during the Persian Gulf War, did not take his own life. Shortly after midnight on June 8, he called a Veterans Affairs confidential crisis hotline. Minutes later, a Virginia Tech officer arrived, and Mr. Duvall alerted him to the makeshift gun. The call likely saved Mr. Duvall's life, but it also led to a legal showdown with the federal government that could land Mr. Duvall in prison for 40 years.
Virginia originally charged Mr. Duvall with carrying a concealed weapon without a license - a misdemeanor that carries a possible 12-month sentence and $2,500 fine. Even this charge seems uncalled for, given the circumstances and the fact that Mr. Duvall never threatened or attempted to harm anyone else. The travesty was multiplied when state prosecutors dismissed their case to allow the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Virginia to press federal charges. Federal prosecutors obtained a four-count indictment that included charges for possessing and manufacturing a "destructive device"; each count carries a possible 10-year sentence. 
Mr. Duvall's lawyers argue unconvincingly that a federal judge should dismiss the case because it is "a violation of due process" for the United States to promise confidentiality for hotline callers only to "use statements and evidence provided in reliance on that assurance . . . as the basis for a criminal prosecution." Taken to an extreme, this argument would foreclose charging a veteran who called the hotline and then murdered his family. This cannot be right. But it should not take a judge's intervention to see the charges dismissed; U.S. Attorney Timothy J. Heaphy should do that on his own.
In court papers, Mr. Heaphy's office argues that "the law must be applied with equal force to all in this country." In the same document the office acknowledges that the United States also "has discretion in determining which charges to bring." Exactly: Prosecutors wield enormous power, and with that power comes an obligation to ensure that justice is done.
Mr. Heaphy and his office are right to be alert to the danger of guns near or on the Virginia Tech campus, given the 2007 massacre that took the lives of 32 people and injured two dozen more. But they're also obliged to evaluate each case judiciously. In the Duvall case, the prosecutor has transformed what should be a tool for justice into a cruel and blunt instrument.

Afghan police torn over Koran burning

BYLINE: Kevin Sieff

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A01

LENGTH: 1129 words

DATELINE: KABUL

KABUL - The police officers had been told to be vigilant. They had been warned that protests could occur spontaneously and could again turn deadly, as they had for two days after U.S. military officialsburned copies of the Koran.
But some of those same Afghan police officers showed few qualms Thursday in telling a foreign reporter that their mission left them deeply uneasy. What their government was asking, they said, was for police officers to quell protesters whose cause they fully shared. 
"Afghans and the world's Muslims should rise against the foreigners. We have no patience left," said one police officer in central Kabul, who has worked at the same checkpoint since he joined the force seven months ago. He looked at his colleague, who stood next to him, nodding. "We both will attack the foreign military people."
Police officers interviewed at four posts in the Afghan capital voiced the anti-American sentiments on the same day that two U.S. troops in eastern Afghanistan were fatally shot by a man wearing an Afghan army uniform. The killings were the latest apparent incident of fratricide aimed at Americans within a nominally united U.S.-Afghan force, and they have added to misgivings among many U.S. troops about the loyalty of their Afghan counterparts.
In the wake of the Koran burning that came to light Tuesday at the largest U.S. military base in Afghanistan, some uniformed Afghan officers have worked tirelessly to keep the peace through three days of demonstrations and riots. At least three protesters were killed Thursday, bringing the week's death toll to 10, as some police officers were ordered to fire on demonstrators.
But it has been Afghan civilians, not Taliban insurgents, who have taken the lead in the violence, and in five interviews Thursday, members of the Afghan police force made clear that they and others in positions of authority share in the anger and resentment.
"Those behind the act should be asked about their deed and must be punished," said an officer near a U.S. military base in Kabul. "If I find the opportunity, I would shoot them in the head."
The police officers would discuss their sentiments only on the condition of anonymity, saying they would risk their livelihoods if they were to sympathize publicly with those fomenting violence. But their comments left little doubt that the fallout over the U.S. military's mishandling of the Korans includes fresh hostility among a crucial population of workaday Afghans, including some who man security checkpoints near Western installations. 

U.S. apologies dismissed
In a bid to ease tensions, President Obama took the unusual step of extending a personal apology for the incident. 
White House spokesman Jay Carney, speaking to reporters Thursday aboard Air Force One en route to Miami, said the apology was part of a three-page letter to President Hamid Karzai covering a variety of issues. Carney said the apology was "wholly appropriate, given the sensitivities to this issue," as well as Obama's "primary concern" for the safety of American military and civilian personnel in Afghanistan.
With tensions still high, however, the U.S. Embassy remained on lockdown for a second day and extended its travel restrictions to a typically peaceful part of northern Afghanistan. 
In a meeting with Karzai ahead of Friday prayers, some members of the Afghan parliament demanded harsh retribution, while religious officials spoke of jihad and the urgent need to respond with violence. At the same time, the Taliban issued a harshly worded statement encouraging Afghan security officials to take up arms against Western forces. 
On the streets of Kabul, police officers said they didn't care about the flurry of U.S. apologies, including the one from Obama, or the demands of Afghan politicians. The offense felt was personal, most said, not diminished by contrition or inflamed by hostile rhetoric.
"It is difficult sometimes to convince people not to resort to protest," said Qaseem Jangalbagh, the police chief of Panjshir province. Asked whether that included his own officers, he said, "It is a problem."
Junior officers spoke more bluntly, saying they would shirk their duties rather than quash demonstrations and referring often to their own violent impulses. 
"We should burn those foreigners," said a police officer in his early 30s who has been in the force for almost 2ג[#x20ac][#x160]1 / 2 years. Like most of the country's security officers, he was trained by NATO troops.

Anger within Bagram base
Police officers weren't the only Afghans assumed to be U.S. allies who spoke of mounting friction. The first early morning protests Tuesday were led by Afghan employees of Bagram air base, where the religious materials were burned. NATO military officials have said in public statements that the incineration was accidental. 
Some Bagram employees - who often face threats for aiding the United States - waved the charred books in the air, demanding a response. 
Those employees, among the 5,000 Afghans who support the base's operations, chanted "Death to America" and lobbed rocks at gates that some had entered for years. Some cursed their bosses and promised never to return to work at Bagram.
"How could we ever work for someone who could do this?" asked a 21-year-old man who said he had worked for two years in a warehouse on the base. "This couldn't have happened by accident. This was meant to offend us."
Taliban officials, who are in the middle of tenuous peace talkswith the United States, had initially condemned the burning but stopped short of advocating violence - an uncharacteristically muted response. But in the written statement released Thursday, the insurgent group took a tougher stance.
The statement described the burning as a "deliberate" act, despite repeated statements by top U.S. officials that the books were sent to the incinerator by mistake. The Taliban statement said Afghans and Muslims should not be placated by the U.S. apologies and declared that protests and "mere slogans" were not enough of a response.
"For the defense of our holy book, we . . . must target the invaders' military centers, their military convoys and their invading forces . . . so that they can never dare to desecrate the holy Koran again," the statement said.
It was difficult to determine whether the attack Thursday on the U.S. troops was orchestrated by the Taliban or was a response to the group's call for revenge. The attack occurred in eastern Afghanistan, the U.S. military said. Few details were released.

SEALs foil plot, and vice versa

BYLINE: Mark Jenkins

SECTION: WEEKEND; Pg. T31

LENGTH: 484 words

Military reality and video-game fantasy shake hands and come out fighting in "Act of Valor," an action flick that stars actual Navy SEALs. The exercises are genuine, and so is the hardware. But the script undermines the sense of authenticity at every turn. 
Conceived as a recruitment film, "Act of Valor" was directed by TV-commercial veterans (and former stuntmen) Mike McCoy and Scott Waugh. Because the movie wasn't originally supposed to be a commercial feature, the filmmakers got unprecedented access to guns, choppers, submarines and other expensive gear. This enabled them to make a blockbuster-size movie for about $12 million.
The action begins immediately, with a training jump near San Diego. But screenwriter Kurt Johnstad (who toiled on "300") is already sketching the back story. Rorke is the son of a military man for whom "being dangerous was sacred." (There are many lines like that.) Also, he's about to learn that his wife is pregnant with their first child.
Rorke is the real first name of the SEAL who plays the movie's central character. (None of the SEALs' surnames are revealed.) He's clearly not trained in delivering dialogue or expressing emotion. Yet the stiffness of the Navy men's performances is less of a problem than the global-conspiracy plot that's about to commence.
In Costa Rica, a CIA agent is posing as a doctor while observing an international drug and arms smuggler. Her cover is blown, and she's captured and tortured. Soon, the SEAL team arrives for the rescue.
But their work has just begun. The smuggler is a Ukrainian Jew who grew up with a Chechen Muslim who has become a terrorist. The dealer is helping the terrorist smuggle a group of Filipinos into the United States from Mexico. They're suicide bombers, outfitted with explosive vests that supposedly can't be detected. The SEALs must follow the group all the way to the final shootout.
This is where the movie enters "Mission: Impossible" territory. In real life, SEALs handle individual missions. But this movie turns them into a squad of indispensable Ethan Hunts, hopping the globe to foil supervillains, and following the tidy plot to its bloody conclusion.
Like most recent action movies, "Act of Valor" is fast, loud and strenuously over-edited. The filmmakers successfully conjure a chaotic, you-are-there sensation. Exactly what's happening, however, can be hard to follow.
While the SEAL raid that eliminated Osama bin Laden hadn't occurred when this project began, reconstructing a single assignment like that would have made for a better, and more believable, movie. "Act of Valor" is gripping when it focuses on procedural details. But whenever the movie goes Hollywood, its celebration of steely competence softens into macho sentimentality.

Accessory sentenced in trooper killing 
The man who provided the gun used to kill a Maryland state trooper outside a Forestville restaurant in 2010 was sentenced to five years in prison Thursday for his role in the shooting, authorities said.
Anthony Milton, 29, had pleaded guilty to being an accessory after the fact in the June 2010 slaying of Trooper Wesley Brown, who was shot while working an off-duty security job at the Applebee's on Donnell Drive. The five-year sentence was part of a deal with prosecutors in which he agreed to testify against Cyril Williams, the man who shot and killed Brown. 
Williams was convicted last week of first-degree murder and related offenses.

VIRGINIA

State seeks relieffrom 'No Child' law
The Virginia Board of Education voted unanimously Thursday to request relief from key parts of the federal No Child Left Behind law, which has been widely criticized as saddling schools with unrealistic goals and harsh penalties.
If Education Secretary Arne Duncan grants Virginia's request, schools will no longer be required to ensure that all students are on track for proficiency in math and reading by 2014.
Instead, Virginia will judge schools according to a state accreditation system, which is based on graduation rates and student proficiency on math, language arts, social studies and science tests. 
Ninety-six percent of Virginia schools were fully accredited last year, as opposed to 38 percent deemed successful under No Child Left Behind.

Mother tells jury about trying to hold her slain son

BYLINE: Keith L. Alexander

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B03

LENGTH: 485 words

The mother of a District man whose 2010 slaying set off a series of shootings that left four others dead and nine injured broke down in tears in D.C. Superior Court as she described hearing a hail of gunshots and seeing her dying son slumped over in the driver's seat of a car. 
"It sounded like a war was going on," Diane Howe told jurors Thursday. It was after midnight, and Howe was in bed on the third floor of an apartment building in the 1300 block of Alabama Avenue where her son, Jordan Howe, 20, and others gathered the night of March 22, 2010 for a party.
Diane Howe said she jumped up, ran outside and asked people where her only child was. One of her nieces, covered in blood, said he had been shot.
Howe ran to the car and tried to hold her son but was fearful moving him could cause more harm. "Don't leave me, Jordan," she recalled saying. "You promised me you wouldn't leave me." 
Several people told Howe that her son's childhood friend, Sanquan "Bootsie" Carter was one of the shooters in an incident that left two others injured, she testified. Howe had known Carter, 21, for more than a decade. 
Diane Howe's testimony came in the trial of five mencharged in her son's shooting and two others. Prosecutors say Carter, his older brother Orlando Carter, 22, and friends Jeffrey D. Best, 23, and Nathaniel Simms, 28, armed with an AK-47-style-assault rifle, a .380 pistol and a 12-gauge shotgun - weapons, prosecutors say, which were supplied by Lamar Williams, 23 - descended on the building after Sanquan Carter told them someone stole his bracelet, a gold-painted piece of jewelry with rhinestones. 
A day later, Orlando Carter was injured in a shooting that prosecutors say was retaliation for Howe's murder. Prosecutors say Carter then organized friends, including Robert Bost, 23, to orchestrate a retaliation shooting. 
On March 30, the day of Howe's funeral, Orlando Carter, Best, Bost and Simms allegedly shot and killed Tavon Nelson, 17, while trying to steal Nelson's gun. Minutes later, the men drove to the 4000 block of South Capitol Street SE and opened fire on a crowd of mourners. Three teenagers were killed and six others were wounded. 
Attorneys for all five men said their clients were not guilty. Simms later pleaded guilty to five counts of second-degree murder.
Howe had no knowledge of the bracelet. During the March 22 party, Howe's girlfriend Keya Harrington, unbeknownst to anyone, picked it up from a dresser and placed it on her wrist. Harrington, 20, told jurors she "forgot" she had the bracelet when she left. That evening, she testified, she watched Carter searching for something but he never said what he was looking for. 
Norman Williams, Howe's father, shook his head as Harrington testified. "It seems so surreal that five young people are dead over something they never knew anything about, a bracelet," Williams said later. "It's senseless."

Family Filmgoer: 'Secret World of Arrietty,' 'The Vow' and more

BYLINE: Jane Horwitz

SECTION: WEEKEND; Pg. T34

LENGTH: 912 words

7

and older
The Secret World of Arrietty (G).ג[#x20ac][#x201a]Children age 7 and older will delight in this charmer - a stunning, artful adaptation of Mary Norton's popular children's book "The Borrowers." Young Shawn, an adolescent boy with a heart problem, comes to stay at a country cottage while he awaits surgery. He's shocked and thrilled to see tiny teenage Arrietty and tries to make friends with the salt-shaker-size girl, but her parents have told her never to trust humans. Eventually, Shawn earns that trust by helping retrieve supplies for her family's cozy home under the floorboards. When Haru, the eccentric housekeeper at the cottage, suspects Shawn has discovered those little people, she tries to capture them. Shawn and a woods-dwelling Borrower named Spiller help Arrietty and her parents to safety.
THE BOTTOM LINE: There are moments of suspense when you fear that the Borrowers will fall or be caught by humans. Kids younger than 7 may be upset to see Arrietty's mother imprisoned in a jar. Shawn's heart ailment could worry some children. The ending has a slightly bittersweet tone not common to Hollywood animated features. 

PG-

13
This Means War. Too crass for middle-schoolers, "This Means War" may amuse high-schoolers looking for a bit of mindless entertainment. Two hunky CIA agents in the Los Angeles branch fall in love with the same woman, unknown to them or to her. They are working partners and best buds. When Tuck and FDR discover they've both fallen for Lauren in separate encounters, they don't tell her. Instead, they compete ferociously to win her. Lauren is clueless. She deals with her angst over dating two guys by talking to her foul-mouthed married friend and decides she must sleep with each guy to make a final choice.
THE BOTTOM LINE: The film is replete with sexual innuendo, some of it awfully crude. Sexual situations are occasionally steamy for a PG-13. The script includes frequent midrange profanity, including the F-word, and a drug reference. There is understated violence.
The Vow. Teens can get out the tissues and have a good time at this tale of love that's found, lost and then found again. There's nothing in it, really, that should exclude middle-schoolers. "The Vow" traces the love of Paige, a sculptor, and Leo, who owns a recording studio. They fall in love and get married. Their life is arty, urban and loving. Four years later, they're in a bad car accident and Paige loses all memory of their relationship. Her ultra-controlling parents urge her to come home. It's up to Leo to make Paige fall in love with him again.
The bottom line: The car accident is disturbing, but not bloody. We see the start of a sexual situation, but it's nongraphic and the scene cuts to the next morning. There is brief nonsexual back-view nudity. The script includes occasional midrange profanity and discussion of an extramarital affair. Characters drink wine and engage in a fistfight.

R
Rampart. Teens 17 and older, especially college-age cinema buffs, will be gripped by Woody Harrelson's portrayal of a downward-spiraling Los Angeles cop. The film takes place in 1999, when the LAPD was going through a major corruption scandal, but the story of street cop Dave Brown is fiction. He has a promiscuous, liquor-fueled personal life, and an approach to police work that is a disaster. After realizing he's under investigation, he tells the police internal affairs people and the district attorney's office where they can go. 
THE BOTTOM LINE: Harrelson's character engages in beatings and point-blank shootings. He smokes, drinks and abuses drugs. Other characters smoke pot. We see him involved in steamy sexual situations that are semi-explicit. Scenes at a sex club show partial nudity. 
Act of Valor.ג[#x20ac][#x201a]Genuine Navy SEALs battle fictional terrorists in this action-heavy movie. Originally conceived as a recruiting film, it's likely to appeal to teenage boys. As in most contemporary battle flicks, the fidgety combat scenes have a video-game feel. The dialogue is wooden, as is the SEALs' delivery, but there's not much talk amid the firefights. The individual sequences seem realistic, if over-edited. But the plot becomes more and more implausible as it escalates from the kidnapping of a CIA agent to a scheme to import a squad of suicide bombers into the United States.
THE BOTTOM LINE: The tough-guy talk includes profanity, but this movie earns its R with intense violence, including torture. One central character suffers a gruesome death, there are explicit depictions of battlefield medicine, and a woman is interrogated with the assistance of an electric drill.
Coriolanus.ג[#x20ac][#x201a]High school seniors and college students may find this adaptation of Shakespeare's "Coriolanus" gripping and modern, though it is too realistically violent for under-17s. A military hero, Caius Martius has no problem representing his country, "Rome," in war. But when he's named consul and given the title Coriolanus, he is unable to humble himself before the common people and ask for their support. He so offends the people with his arrogance that he is banished. Embittered, he joins forces with Rome's enemy. The story and the abridged Shakespearean text, while not easy, are sharply to the point.
The bottom line: The warfare scenes are violent and bloody. The bombed-out urban scenery and hollow-eyed inhabitants are reminiscent of the 1990s Bosnian war.

gANNA IN THE TROPICS
At GALA Hispanic Theatre through March 4
Nilo Cruz's Pulitzer Prize-winning drama centers on a family-owned cigar factory in the Ybor City section of Tampa in 1929. After the family matriarch hires a lector named Juan Julian, he begins to read "Anna Karenina" to his new audience. Gradually, Tolstoy's tale influences the lives of the factory community in ways that are redemptive, erotic and tragic. It's the personal dynamics that surge to the fore in this production, which marks the Spanish-language premiere of Cruz's play. Actors portraying two sets of couples create moments of arresting intimacy, while emphasizing the human ability to endure and trust in the face of disappointment and suffering. When not deployed in a scene, the actors sometimes stand around the edges of the stage, in view of the audience - a reminder of how personalities, both known and fictional, haunt the imaginations of Cruz's characters.

gASTRO BOY AND THE GOD OF COMICS
At Studio Theatre through March 11
A visit to Natsu Onoda Power's breathtakingly imaginative, eye-delighting performance piece will set your inner 10-year-old free. For this idea-packed excursion into the life and work of cartoonist legend Osamu Tezuka, who created the '60s Japanese robot action hero Astro Boy, Power appropriates the tools of other graphic and creative arts and shows us what it feels like to exert an exuberant control over them all. The piece tries out its own act of animation on the spirit of an artist. And it does so in lovingly virtuoso style, the likes of which Washington theater has not encountered. The play consists of 10 episodes unfolded in reverse chronology, and you have some potential coherence issues. I suspect the director-playwright may be loath to make any pedestrian alterations to her nonlinear construction, but some additional surrender to the need for biographical clarity, especially at the show's outset, would be helpful.

gCIVILIZATION (ALL YOU CAN EAT)
At Woolly Mammoth Theatre through March 11
Sarah Marshall is Big Hog, who starts Jason Grote's weirdly worth-it new play as just another quadruped marked for slaughter and ends up on two feet, the formidable representative of a money culture in which one can claw and devour one's way to the very top. Grote makes the ascendancy of an animal to high social standing one of the narrative pillars of his surrealist exploration of the moral stew of contemporary life. The play is a well-constructed satire, thoughtfully orchestrated by director Howard Shalwitz, and designed for an age of ominous indicators. Although the final tableau could send us out of Woolly with a bit more oomph, it does succeed at its goal of turning our stomachs. In service of that achievement, the play can surely be said to go whole hog.

GENESIS REBOOT
At Synetic Theater at Crystal City through March 3
Wouldn't you know, no matter how hard the heavenly forces try to prevent it, something always goes wrong when a fallible species is created - especially when profaner spirits can't keep their hands off. That is the tack of director Ben Cunis, who with his brother wrote this modernized fable, an earnest effort that never quite catches fire. The production is in need of a clearer path. While the story of Eden II is fleshed out with energetic earnestness - thanks largely to Eve and Adam - an accompanying version of Cain and Abel provides a strange counterpoint. The umbrella title under which the show is presented, "New Movements," is a bit misleading because the evening is more talk than action. (Irina Tsikurishvili's choreography is, for once, sporadic and disappointing.) Worrisome, too, is the reinforcing here of Synetic Theater's sometime tendency to take on a big, portentous subject without a fully functioning narrative. Maybe the company should change up more often and tackle topics with a larger quantity of helium than lead.
- P.M.

HERCULES IN RUSSIA
At Montgomery College Cultural Arts Center through March 4
In imagining the life of Jim Hercules, a black Alabaman living in St. Petersburg in the early 20th century, Allyson Currin's historical drama traces ironies and thematic parallels that are sharp and tidy. As Robert K. Massie related in his book "Nicholas and Alexandra," Jim Hercules served as an attendant to the imperial family in the years before the Russian Revolution. In Currin's telling, receiving its world premiere from the Doorway Arts Ensemble, he's a refugee from American racism and race-inspired conflict who finds comfort and security as a loyal member of the St. Petersburg court. Unfortunately, as the play fleshes out these relationships and evokes the lead-up to revolution, it graphs the tale onto a set of trim moral symmetries. Surmounting the script's didacticism, several of director Jessica Lefkow's actors manage to conjure up vibrant characters. However, Ricardo Frederick Evans's Jim is a little flat.

gINTO THE DOLLHOUSE
At Flashpoint through Sunday
Carmen C. Wong zeroes in on the growth stages of womankind in this play, her interactive contemplation of what gets filtered through the consciousness of a girl in a world governed so thoroughly by external appearance. This soothing new performance piece cocoons an audience in the music and imagery of popular culture and moves Wong a step or two closer to conventional narrative, in the sense that for this new nonlinear work, an audience member participates only as much as he or she wants to. The play is for those with a predilection for theater that wanders out of bounds. Wong's intriguing mֳ©tier is performance that's more associative than demonstrative: You pass through the permeable layer of Wong's artifice and into her warm imagination.
- P.M.

PETER PAN: THE BOY WHO HATED MOTHERS
At H Street Playhouse through March 3
It's a nasty drop from the warm and fuzzy Darling family of the popular Broadway musical version of "Peter Pan" to the suffering brood of dramatist Michael Lluberes's adaptation. If your temperament is suited to some of the colder considerations of "Peter Pan" - the beloved tale of the boy who defies nature by refusing to grow up - then this inventive though uneven production, written and directed by Lluberes, will strike you as a novel spin on a dramatic chestnut. No Rules Theatre Company's staging in the compact Playhouse space doesn't always allow for the most graceful of scene changes or athletic of sword fights. And during a few talky stretches of the long first act, one wishes that the pirate captain might from time to time level that hook at the script. Still, Lluberes takes an admirable stab at enveloping the two worlds of the story - the Darling household and Neverland - in a unifying starkness, and as a result, makes it clear how thoroughly this scarred Wendy and Peter find consolation in each other's realities.

ALMOST, MAINE
At 1st Stage through Sunday
The whimsy is laid on with a trowel in "Almost, Maine," John Cariani's evening of interlocking playlets about the travails and magic of young love. A talented young cast backed by an inventive design team has sporadic success cutting through the emotional peanut butter that is the script. Director Michael Chamberlin and his actors might have done better to work a little against the play's grain, instead of approaching it with so much wide-eyed wonder. The opening scene sets the tone: Two love-besotted young people (Jessica Shearer and Elliott Kashner) cavort in the snow in slow motion, then remark upon the stars. In the next scene, a hiker (Megan Dominy) arrives at an old farm house intending to camp nearby and view the Northern Lights. The homeowner (Jonathan Lee Taylor) falls instantly in love with her and plants a surprising kiss on her lips. It all gets to be a bit much pretty fast. The surfeit of cuteness aside, there are a few lovely moments in "Almost, Maine" that allow the cast to shine and director Chamberlin to show a certain nimbleness with a cloying script.

BLOOD WEDDING
At Source through March 4
Ah, the high ceremony and doom of Federico Garcia Lorca's "Blood Wedding": You can hear it in the opening notes of Mariano Vales's original music for Constellation Theatre's new production. Behzad Habibzai plucks his flamenco guitar and you sit up straight, as if you've just heard a rattlesnake's warning. It turns out to be a false alarm, for this "Blood Wedding" slacks off almost as soon as it begins. Lorca's 1933 tragedy chronicles irresistible passion and a deep family feud, and it does so in a high poetic style that eludes much of this show. The characters are archetypes: the severe Mother, the handsome Groom, the furtive young Bride, etc. Only Leonardo, the hot-tempered rival for the Groom's fiance, has a name. The fable is a sequence of small moments and grand gestures, but the size and suddenness of Lorca's style hasn't really been mastered by director Shirley Serotsky and her cast.

ELEPHANT ROOM
At Arena Stage through Sunday
The Kogod Cradle, Arena Stage's architecturally high-toned third stage, may not have been the ideal host for "Elephant Room," a tacky bit of absurdist illusioneering, informed by the ambience of strip-mall cocktail lounges and landscapes featured on motel room walls. No, "Elephant Room," written and performed by Steve Cuiffo, Geoff Sobelle and Trey Lyford, would look far more comfortable in some ramshackle, claustrophobic space, where its raw aesthetics and ironic sensibility might not pose the glaring counterpoint that it does to refined surroundings. As it is, the 70-minute show, directed by Paul Lazar, comes across as a thin - and occasionally downright sloppy - riff on the sorry state of that quaint staple of birthday parties and down-market casinos, the professional magician. Relying on the good will of audience members (a couple of whom are brought into the antics) the show gives the appearance of being more sincere than, say, something caustically whipped up by the put-on jokester Sacha Baron Cohen of "Borat" fame.

gTHE GAMING TABLE
At Folger Theatre through March 4
With a buoyant air and a bouquet of ripe performances, Folger Theatre further expands Washington's classical borders with "The Gaming Table," a sendup of 18th-century social probity by the Restoration-comedy playwright Susanna Centlivre. Name doesn't ring a bell? Nope, not with me, either. That's partly why this piquant dish, mounted with considerable aplomb by director Eleanor Holdridge - and dressed to the sensational nines by costume designer Jessica Ford - comes with a side of pleasant discovery. Centlivre, whom history records as a feisty, self-reliant sort (How, really, could she not have been?), was one of the few women writing popular plays in England at the turn of the 18th century, when comic dramatists such as William Congreve ("The Way of the World") were in vogue. Refreshingly in "The Gaming Table," it's the women who, by and large, dictate romantic terms. They're ladies who know what they want and only reluctantly yield to the entreaties of husbands and suitors.

JOSEPHINE TONIGHT
At MetroStage through March 18
Even while applauding the veteran team behind this undeniably entertaining new musical based on the early life of Josephine Baker, one can't help coming away from the show with a stubborn sense that something is off. "Josephine Tonight" feels small in ways that have little to do with MetroStage's intimate space. In fact, director-choreographer Maurice Hines has filled the stage with crackling dance numbers and sharp acting by the four highly seasoned pros in the cast of five. The rag-and-blues-inspired tunes were composed by the late Wally Harper, best known as singer Barbara Cook's longtime musical director and accompanist. The lyrics and script are by Sherman Yellen, a Tony nominee for the book of the 1970 musical "The Rothschilds." Harper's and Yellen's ragtime- and blues-inspired songs often sparkle with wit, melodiousness and infectious rhythm. But there are simply too many songs, especially in the very top-heavy Act 1. More important, though, is the lack of depth and grit in the performance of singer/dancer/actress Zurin Villanueva as Josephine Baker. Villanueva needs to be the molten core of the show and she isn't - not yet.

LES JUSTES
At Artisphere through March 11
In WSC Avant Bard's bright, fast production of Albert Camus's "Les Justes (The Just Ones)," the characters gather and debate on a tight, elevated white platform, with the audience in Arlington's intimate Artisphere surrounding the stage. David C. Ghatan's set and lights display the drama as gleamingly as the Hope Diamond. It's a precious setting for the blood-and-guts terrorist philosophizing of Camus's 1949 play, which follows a band of conspirators as they carry out a political assassination. But then, what can you do with Camus? The script, translated and adapted by local actor-director-writer Rahaleh Nassri, is full of idealistic speeches that quickly blow cold on the stage. Terror, Justice and Love are discussed like classroom abstractions, amounting to a 90-minute parade of principles that rapidly begs to be roughed up. The sheer physical energy feels like a stab at pumping up the lofty manner of the play, which is more interested in articulating ideas than in dramatizing them. Only John Stange's Stepan, the figure who argues that even children should not be spared in the pure and necessarily violent crusade for revolutionary change, conveys an urgency that's truly persuasive.

NEXT FALL
At Round House Theatre through Sunday
The emotional stakes are high in Geoffrey Nauffts's affecting intimate tragicomedy about love, faith and death. Thanks to a gifted cast and a sensitive director in Mark Ramont, the emotional rewards are high for audiences, as well.This is not to say that the Tony-nominated play (it ran on Broadway in 2010) and Round House's new production unfold flawlessly. Yet the figurative punch in the sternum that theater lovers long for happens at this show in spades. It opens with all the characters save one gathering in a care unit of a New York hospital. Luke, a rising stage actor, has had an accident and lies in a coma. In the waiting room we meet his friend Holly, a new-age-type candle shop owner; his friend and perhaps onetime lover, the uptight Brandon; his voluble, up-from-trailer-trash mother, Arlene, long divorced from but still squabbling with Butch, his Christian fundamentalist father. Dashing in from the airport is Adam, Luke's lover of four years. Nauffts tells the story of Adam and Luke's relationship in flashbacks. We learn how Adam, a 40-year-old hypochondriac with self-confidence issues, met Luke, a 20-ish hunk of a "cater-waiter" and wannabe actor. Adam has had a choking incident at a party. He runs to the restaurant roof to breathe, having been Heimliched by Luke, who follows him up there. They're hooked. Yet this is a match most certainly not made in heaven.

If you gave "The Phantom Tollbooth" some footlights and a contract with Def Jam Recordings (with a G-rating requirement), you might end up with entertainment as inspired and quirky as "P.Nokio: A Hip-Hop Musical." Sure, the latest Imagination Stage world premiere riffs on the so-well-known-it-has-been-Disneyfied story of Pinocchio. But playwright Psalmayene 24 doesn't settle for a bland rehash. As he demonstrated with "Zomo the Rabbit," which Imagination Stage premiered in 2009, Psalmayene 24 has a flair for folding fairy-tale wonder into an infectious hip-hop vibe. As the director of "P.Nokio," as well as its writer and star, he repeats the trick, teleporting us to the realm of Hip-Hopia, where people pay bills in street credits and boomboxes can be the size of city blocks. One of Hip-Hopia's residents is G.Petto (James J. Johnson), a computer game designer who creates a screen-transcending animated child named P.Nokio. Sent off to attend the Old School, P.Nokio willfully wanders past a Fork in the road into the Forest of Fraudulent Fun, where he is bamboozled by con artists Fox Madoff (Jacob Yeh) and Cat Burgler (Carkuff). But all ends happily, thanks to the intervention of the spray-painting Graffiti Fairy (Paige Hernandez) and, more important, P.Nokio's real love for G.Petto.

REALLY REALLY
At Signature Theatre through March 25
This may be the first time you're hearing of Paul Downs Colaizzo, but on the evidence of his crackling new play, "Really Really," the name bears committing to memory. A sexually charged comedy-drama about self-serving collegians of a coldly calculating variety, "Really Really" sucks you in with its brio and caustic wit and holds you with its teasingly clever double-edged plot. As shepherded by Signature's artistic second-in-command, Matthew Gardiner - who hereby submits his credentials for entry to the first-class cabin of Washington directors - "Really Really" is the sharpest original play the Arlington company has offered up in years. Granted, this has not been Signature's strongest suit. Still, the confident wit and topical vitality of "Really Really" assuredly propels Signature into the thick of the region's hunt for new plays of provocation and style. The 26-year-old Colaizzo wags a scandalized finger at his own generation in "Really Really" and cries "shame." Colaizzo's young people - all students, save one, at some American university or other specializing in course work and material comfort - practice what Colaizzo sees as the sorry singleminded preoccupation of the age: looking out ruthlessly for Number One.

RED
At Arena Stage through March 11
For all its highfalutin discourse, the most engrossing moment of Arena Stage's immensely enjoyable "Red" comes when the two actors dip their brushes into buckets and paint. The activity in which the superbly matched Edward Gero and Patrick Andrews engage, in point of fact, is priming a canvas half again as tall as the two of them. The pleasure of the interlude is in the way it conveys the full, symbiotic immersion of the characters: Gero's Mark Rothko, the vain, abrasive creator of all those mesmerizing canvases of migrating mood and undulating color, and Andrews's Ken, a composite of the assistants who toiled in Rothko's Manhattan studio. Rothko acknowledges anxiety over the pop-art movement that is supplanting abstract expressionism. Ken pricks Rothko's conscience. Both the painter and his assistant know from pain; it's as certain an ingredient in their work as the pigments they mix. Maybe that helps explain why Rothko and his young employee find in the act of priming a canvas a cathartic common pursuit. They don't simply aim to prime that canvas. They want to unleash the Furies on it.
- P.M.
Friday and Thursday at 8, Saturday at 2 and 8, Sunday at 1 and 6, Tuesday at noon and Wednesday at noon and 7:30. 1101 Sixth St. SW. 202-488-3300. www.arenastage.org. $55-$100.

THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA
At Lansburgh Theatre through March 4
The Shakespeare Theatre Company's entertaining but over-the-top "The Two Gentlemen of Verona" wastes no time coming at you. PJ Paparelli's production of Shakespeare's comedy about double-crossing friends opens in a fast-food parking lot with teenagers engaging in binge drinking. Yes, it's a comedy: The play has two clowns and a dog, and the lovers and friends spend a lot of time swapping witty repartee. But the emotional switchbacks are sharp, and the play's sudden ending threatens real violence. If the show doesn't quite click, it's largely because of its cineplex-style use of U2 tunes and firearms. Music is oxygen in this milieu, of course, but some of the songs are so painfully on the nose as to be eye-rolling. There are "Glee"-spirited moments that will make you laugh, but that's offset by the sense of applying an easy pop patch where the characters or story seem reluctant to fly. But the big test of how you feel about this lively "Two Gents" is how you respond to its violence. Some of the chase scenes and scuffles are fabulous, but this weaponized show repeatedly pushes its kids to extreme moments of despair and self-damage with razors and pistols, making this play darker and more disturbing. In his last plays, Shakespeare used magic and an expansive spirit to make us accept crazy tales. For the rougher "Two Gents," Paparelli gets it done at gunpoint.

Mystics exchange Anosike for guard, forward

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. D02

LENGTH: 649 words

After signing one free agent center and trading for another this offseason, the Washington Mystics made another move Thursday to balance out its roster. General Manager and Coach Trudi Lacey announced the team has acquired guard Natasha Lacey and forward LaToya Pringle from the Los Angeles Sparks in exchange for center Nicky Anosike.
Pringle, a 6-foot-3 forward, was the 13th overall pick in the 2008 WNBA draft by the Phoenix Mercury out of North Carolina. She averaged 3.9 points and 2.4 rebounds per game last season while playing for the Sparks. 
Lacy averaged five points, 2.2 rebounds and 1.7 assists per game last season. Originally a second-round pick by the Detroit Shock in 2008, the 5-10 guard is currently playing alongside new Mystics forward Ashley Walker for Ceyhan BLD in Turkey.
"We are happy to have acquired two versatile and experienced players," Lacey said in a team-issued statement.
- Mark Giannotto
Former NBA player Javaris Crittenton has been freed from jail in Riverdale, Ga., following his arrest on charges of obstructing a police officer and speeding.
Crittenton has been out on bond on charges that he killed a woman in Atlanta. He faces a murder charge after police accused him of killing 23-year-old Jullian Jones during an August drive-by shooting. A message left for Crittenton's attorney was not immediately returned.
Crittenton was jailed Wednesday after being stopped by police, who say he refused to get out of his Porsche. Riverdale police Maj. Greg Barney says he was going more than 60 mph in a 45-mph zone.
Clayton County Jail records show that the former Washington Wizards player was released on bond Wednesday evening.

HOCKEY
Todd Bertuzzi has revitalized his career with the Detroit Red Wings, finding a good fit on the ice and perhaps restoring his reputation, too.
The Red Wings signed the 37-year-old forward to a two-year contract worth just more than $4 million.
"He likes it here and we like having him here," Detroit General Manager Ken Holland said. "He's been a good player for us, giving us around the mid-40s in points. He's a big guy with skills hard to find in one player."
Bertuzzi had 12 goals and 29 points going into Thursday's game against Vancouver, one of his former teams. In all, he has 301 career goals and 742 points with the Red Wings, Canucks, New York Islanders, Anaheim, Calgary and Florida.
Bertuzzi has slowly put his most infamous act behind him.
While playing for Vancouver on March 8, 2004, Bertuzzi sucker-punched Colorado's Steve Moore in the head in one of hockey's ugliest episodes. He served a 17-month suspension after hitting Moore and driving him face-first into the ice and breaking three vertebrae in his neck.

TRACK AND FIELD
Two-time Olympic champion Yelena Isinbayeva broke her indoor pole vault world record at the XL Galan meet in Stockholm.
Isinbayeva cleared 16 feet 51  /  4 inches on her second attempt at Globe Arena, topping her mark of 16-43  /  4 set in 2009 at Donetsk, Ukraine.
"This was the real comeback," she said. "This happened because of my dear coach who made me realize that this is my level."
Holly Bleasdale of Britain was second and Yarisley Silva of Cuba third, both clearing 15-53  /  4.
Isinbayeva hasn't won at a major championship since successfully defending her Olympic gold medal in Beijing four years ago.

TENNIS
Jelena Jankovic of Serbia defeated U.S. Open champion Sam Stosur, 6-4, 6-2, to reach the semifinals of the Dubai Tennis Championships.
Defending champion Caroline Wozniacki also reached the semifinals by defeating the other Serbian quarterfinalist, Ana Ivanovic, 6-3, 7-5.
Jankovic next plays fifth-seeded Agnieszka Radwanska. The Pole advanced after defeating ninth-seeded Sabine Lisicki of Germany, 6-2, 6-1. Wozniacki will play the winner of Thursday's last third-round match between Germany's Julia Goerges and Slovakia's Daniela Hantuchova.

In memo, Mubarakasserts innocence
Former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak told the court trying him for complicity in the killing of protesters during last year's uprising that he was saddened by what he called "baseless" claims against him and expressed confidence that the judicial system and history would clear his name.
Mubarak's remarks were made in a memo published in the Tahrir newspaper on Thursday, a day after the former president's defense lawyers delivered their closing remarks after a seven-month trial that has transfixed the nation. 
Lawyers confirmed that Mubarak had presented a letter to the court but said they did not know its contents.
In the letter, which filled three columns on the daily's front page, Mubarak, 83, struck a defiant tone.
"The unjust accusations and the baseless allegations I am facing sadden me," the published letter said. "I am not someone who would shed his people's blood. I have spent my life defending them. Hosni Mubarak is not someone to smear his military honor with ill-gotten wealth."

Merkel apologizesin neo-Nazi case
German Chancellor Angela Merkel apologized Thursday to relatives of those slain in a series of neo-Nazi attacks, asking their forgiveness for botched investigations that left the killers undetected for more than a decade.
Merkel addressed the families of the victims - eight Turks, a Greek and a German policewoman - at a memorial service in Berlin, calling the crimes an attack on German democracy.
Rather than suspecting a right-wing connection to the killings between 2000 and 2007, investigators had looked for mafia or drug-dealing links and even investigated victims' relatives, Merkel said.
It was learned only in November, after a botched bank robbery, that an extremist right-wing cell calling itself the Nationalist Socialist Underground was behind the shootings.

Car bomb kills 13in northwestern city
A car bomb tore through a crowded minibus depot in the northwestern city of Peshawar on Thursday and killed at least 13 people, including at least two children, ending weeks of calm in a city known as a magnet for militant violence.
About 100 pounds of explosives, including artillery shells, were packed into a Honda City car that was detonated by remote control, police said. The depot is routinely thronged with hundreds of passengers heading to or from Pakistan's troubled tribal areas.
No militant group asserted responsibility for the attack.

Guns N' Roses: Out of ammo

BYLINE: Chris Richards

SECTION: STYLE; Pg. C01

LENGTH: 752 words

Guns N' Roses stepped onto the Fillmore Silver Spring stage a few ticks after midnight Friday morning and didn't pack it up until 3:04 a.m. 
It wasn't a rock concert. It was a hostage situation.
Where did these guys even find the gall to call themselves Guns N' Roses? Led by the band's only original member, frontman Axl Rose, this unfocused eight-man crew pranced and preened with the enthusiasm and talent of a tribute band. For three torturous hours, the guys sucked the life force from some of the most anthemic rock songs ever written - "Sweet Child O' Mine," "Paradise City" and "November Rain" among them. 
To call it a train wreck wouldn't be right. Train wrecks are fast and violent. This was like being stuck in gridlock traffic behind a garbage truck in August.
Since Guns N' Roses' beloved original lineup dissolved in the mid-'90s, Rose has become a master of this brand of show-biz sadism. In order to bask in his mediocrity, we must wait. Fans stuck around for 15 years as the man tinkered with "Chinese Democracy," the 2008 opus that only proved how far he had fallen. Now, at age 50, Rose is touring with this version of Guns N' Roses as the band prepares to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in April.  
Dreamers dreamed that this warm-up tour of relatively intimate club dates might include some of the band's early members - guitarists Slash and Izzy Stradlin, bassist Duff McKagan, drummer Steven Adler - that fantastic collision of characters that made Guns N' Roses so magnetic 25 years ago when its album "Appetite for Destruction" gave rock-and-roll its last massive injection of sex and danger.
Instead, Rose has surrounded himself with sloppy, unimaginative players who make him sound dated, safe and sexless. They had no command of pace or rhythm Friday. Drum fills were dashed off. Guitar leads were hurried. And anytime Rose left the stage for one of the dozens of breathers he took throughout the set, the band would wander off into instrumental dead zones, as if trying to discover the intersection of pathetic and insulting. (They found it during a three-minute guitar solo over the "Pink Panther" theme.)
Vocally, Rose sounded battered but not beaten. His indelible screeching - half bird of prey, half race car brake pad - was never expected to last for a lifetime, but his voice sounded stronger than it should.
And he made up for any botched notes with those iconic moves, furiously pacing the stage, leaning against phantom walls, doing that snakey thing with his hips. His physicality was the only thing connecting him to a more glorious past. 
So why did he keep leaving the stage? It served only as a repeated reminder of the Guns N' Roses we weren't seeing. 
The primary stench emanated from Frank Ferrer's drum kit as he carelessly let the songs slip out of focus. It felt most egregious during the finale of "November Rain," as he turned those riveting rat-a-tat snare hits into lazy thwickity-thwacks. 
More embarrassing: the Slash pantomime performed by guitarist DJ Ashba. He seems to have been hired for his ability to wear a top hat, play a Les Paul and smoke cigarettes simultaneously. 
Even the group's most veteran members - bassist Tommy Stinson and pianist Dizzy Reed - failed to bring dignity to these songs. Back to noodling at Guitar Center, all of you! 
"Ya' hangin' in there?" Rose asked  before "Shackler's Revenge," a song from "Chinese Democracy" that even fans in "Chinese Democracy" T-shirts seemed annoyed by. It was 1:59 a.m. Sixty-five more minutes to go. 
A distended version of "Knockin' on Heaven's Door" was followed by the evening's only real stage banter: Rose reminiscing about the legendary Baltimore rock club Hammerjacks. "I remember Maryland," he told the thinning crowd. Yet somehow, this non-story felt endearing, reminding us that there was a human being up there trying to be great again. Stockholm syndrome had officially set in. Encore! Encore! 
Exhausted applause at 2:31 a.m. earned the audience another gratuitous guitar solo interlude, two more tunes from "Chinese Democracy," the acoustic ballad "Patience" - irony! -  and the band's signature, "Paradise City."  
Fans sang along with new zeal, perhaps realizing the song's double-time finale  meant their freedom: "Take me down to the paradise city / Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty / Oh, won't you please take me home?" 
Yes, yes, yes. Let's all get home safely and quickly. Tomorrow, we start trying to forget this night ever happened.

One twin convicted in 2004 bombing
A federal jury on Friday found one of two white supremacist brothers guilty in the racially motivated bombing of an official in suburban Phoenix in 2004.
Identical twins Dennis and Daniel Mahon, 61, of Illinois, were on trial for six weeks.
The jury found Dennis Mahon guilty in the bombing but decided Daniel was not guilty. 
The verdict came nearly eight years after the Feb. 26, 2004, bombing that injured Don Logan, who is black and was Scottsdale's diversity director at the time. Logan was hospitalized for three days and needed four surgeries on his hand and arm. The bombing also injured a secretary.
Prosecutors argued that the Mahon brothers attacked Logan on behalf of a group called the White Aryan Resistance, which they say encourages members to act as "lone wolves" and commit violence against non-whites and the government.
Defense attorneys argued that someone working for the city of Scottsdale was a likelier perpetrator because Logan's job made him unpopular.

Lawmaker sorry for  murder remark    
An Oklahoma congressman apologized Friday for suggesting that "killing a couple" of U.S. senators might be the only way to get a budget through Congress.
U.S. Rep. John Sullivan made the comments Wednesday during a town hall meeting in Bixby. When asked about federal spending, the Tulsa Republican expressed frustration with the Senate's failure to approve a budget.
"I'd love to get them to vote for it," Sullivan said. "Boy, I'd love that, you know. But other than me going over there with a gun and pointing it to their head and maybe killing a couple of 'em, I don't think they're going to listen unless they get beat."
Sullivan's comments were first posted on Talking Points Memo.

Priest says cardinal ignored predators list
A Philadelphia church official facing trial in the priest abuse scandal says he created a list of problem priests in 1994 - but Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua had it destroyed.
Monsignor William Lynn says the Archdiocese of Philadelphia recently turned over a surviving copy that corroborates his claims.
Lynn asked Friday to have his conspiracy and child endangerment case thrown out. 
Lynn is the first U.S. church official charged for allegedly keeping predator-priests in ministry. Bevilacqua died last month.

Marine not guilty in hazing trial: A military jury on Friday found a Marine not guilty of hazing a fellow Hawaii-based lance corporal who killed himself in Afghanistan. The panel found Lance Cpl. Carlos Orozco III not guilty at a court-martial at Marine Corps Base Hawaii in Kaneohe Bay. He was accused of humiliating and demeaning Lance Cpl. Harry Lew by pouring sand on his face and forcing him to do push-ups and leg lifts at their Afghan base. Lew fatally shot himself at the remote patrol base on April 3. 
Postermaker pleads guilty:  The creator of the Barack Obama "HOPE" poster pleaded guilty Friday to criminal contempt, saying he made a "terrible decision" in 2009 to destroy some documents and fabricate others in a civil lawsuit pertaining to the Associated Press photograph he relied upon to make the poster. Shepard Fairey entered the plea in federal court to the misdemeanor charge, which carries a maximum potential penalty of six months in prison. Sentencing was set for July 16.

Arrests reported in more than a dozen thefts

BYLINE: Martin Weil

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B04

LENGTH: 367 words

One victim was painting a fence in Anacostia on Tuesday when his wallet was taken and he was knocked from a ladder. Another victim was leaving the Potomac Avenue Metro station Thursday when he was assaulted and his headphones were taken. 
D.C. police, who are trying to combat a surge in robberies, announced Friday that they recently made arrests in those and more than a dozen other such incidents. Overall, police said, they have made 243 robbery arrests this year.
Several arrests came in incidents involving efforts to take cellphones, according to a police announcement. Others involved purse snatchings. A gun was seen in at least three of the crimes, and a car was taken in one of those three. At least two of the robbery victims suffered minor injuries.
On Tuesday, police said, a man was arrested in the robbery of a business in the 5000 block of Connecticut Avenue, in upper Northwest Washington. Most or all of the others appeared to be street crimes.
One of the downtown incidents occurred Feb. 16, when an iPhone was snatched about 9 p.m. in the 500 block of Seventh Street NW. Police said they arrested a juvenile suspect the next day.
In a Feb. 17 incident in the 1200 block of D Street SE, near the Capitol Hill area, police said an assault occurred at a playground during an attempt to take a cellphone. The victim received minor injuries.
Police said officers patrolling on bicycles arrested two suspects a few blocks away shortly afterward.
One of the armed robberies occurred late Thursday near the 3500 block of A Street SE. Three robbers fled in the victim's car. Police said officers found it in the 1400 block of Pennsylvania Avenue SE and, after a short chase on foot, arrested a suspect.
One of the purse snatchings occurred about 3:30 a.m. Sunday in the 1400 block of U Street NW, police said. A second happened about 6:30 p.m. at 14th Street and Columbia Road NW.
A robbery in which minor injuries were reported occurred about 1:30 a.m. Thursday in the 700 block of Upshur Street NW. Police said two men approached the victim, called him a derogatory name and knocked him down. They took his wallet and fled on foot. Two men were arrested shortly afterward, police said.

Terps' Turgeon wants Padgett to show true grit

BYLINE: Liz Clarke

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. D03

LENGTH: 646 words

After nearly five months coachingJames Padgett, MarylandCoach Mark Turgeon says he's not entirely certain the Terrapins power forward wouldn't step on an ant. But Turgeon suspects as much, struck by Padgett's impeccable manners, soft-spoken nature and general courtesy.
They are qualities that make Padgett a pleasure to coach. But they are also qualities that, from Turgeon's perspective, have tended to hold Padgett back once the ball is tipped. 
"I feel like if he had his way, he would play a lot more complacent," Turgeon said Friday. "I feel like you always have to bring [aggression] out of him."
Such is the role of any coach: Learning the personalities of his players and figuring out what buttons to push to coax the best possible performance from each.
With the 6-foot-8, 225-pound Padgett, Turgeon's challenge has been overcoming his innate kindness and cultivating the toughness and aggression the Terrapins' front court  has needed so badly.
At 16-11, 6-7 ACC, Maryland has paid dearly for its lack of toughness at critical moments - manifested far too often in a failure to protect leads late in games or the inability to battle back from deficits.
But Tuesday's comeback75-70 victory over Miamirevealed a new grit among the Terrapins, who had been humiliated three days earlier by a 27-point loss at Virginia.
Padgett's tough-nosed play was critical to that victory, with the junior muscling inside with less than two minutes remaining for a putback and subsequent free throw that reclaimed the lead for Maryland. He finished with 16 points, tying his career high, on 6-for-8 shooting and pulled down six rebounds.
Padgett is the shortest among the four players in the Terrapins' front-court rotation, which includes 7-foot-1 Alex Len, 6-10 Berend Weijsand 6-9 Ashton Pankey. But he is best positioned to stand up to the pounding of the ACC's big men, with a particular knack for hammering the offensive boards. His 3.5 offensive rebounds per game are second in the ACC to North Carolina's Tyler Zeller, who averages 3.9.
And Padgett continues to work on heeding Turgeon's advice, which he said he has heard for years. But it's not his natural instinct.
"I hear it from a lot of people. They tell me I'm too nice - 'You have to go out and play more aggressive,' " Padgett said. But "what I noticed: I tried it, and it doesn't work for me. I have to play basketball the way James plays basketball. When I try to step out of my character, I start thinking too much. I get too aggressive and take bad shots."
So he's trying to strike a balance, asserting himself under the rim without forcing things. And Turgeon has taken note.
"He has formed better habits as far as playing tougher as the season has gone on, but it's definitely not his makeup," Turgeon said. "I don't have a problem with that. I tell guys all the time: 'You can be the nicest guy off the court. That makes my job a lot easier. But when we get between the lines, [we need] a different person.' "
Padgett's progress will be put to the test Saturday, when the Terrapins take on Georgia Tech (9-18, 2-11) at Atlanta's Philips Arena, site of this season's ACC tournament.
The Yellow Jackets are mired at the bottom of the conference standings and are expected to be without leading scorer and rebounder Glen Rice Jr., who is suspended indefinitely.
But it's hardly a sure victory for Maryland, which has won just once on the road this season (at Clemson) and shown a troubling tendency to ease off rather than get fired up after a win. In fact, it has been nearly six weeks since Maryland won back-to-back games, defeating Wake Forest on Jan. 11 and Georgia Tech on Jan. 15.
"Sometimes it seems like we are content, and we don't guard with the same aggression, and it doesn't seem like we play as hard [after a victory]," Padgett conceded. "But we can't be content. . . . We need this win coming up."

In 'Rampart,' a sinister cop and sympathy for the badge

BYLINE: John DeFore

SECTION: STYLE; Pg. C01

LENGTH: 958 words

In "Rampart," which opens here Friday, Woody Harrelson plays a very bad cop - a man whose badge is an all-access pass to bigotry, manipulation and lawbreaking, whose perverse sense of entitlement extends to his home life, as well. (The wholly fictional film takes place in the shadow of the real-life Rampart scandal, in which dozens of Los Angeles police officers were accused of crimes in the late 1990s.)
Given the actor's well-known opposition to America's law-and-order status quo (from wars overseas to, as he puts it, "The War on Non-Corporate Drugs"), the film might look on paper like an unsubtle insult to law enforcers in general. But both Harrelson and the film's director, Oren Moverman, disavow that notion, insisting that the project has made them more sympathetic, not less, to those policing our streets. 
Both men say their personal experiences with police officers have been largely trouble-free. Harrelson admits he's had "bad experiences with cops" - it's hard to be an openly pot-smoking, antiwar, environmental activist without occasional encounters- but claims he's been "really lucky" on the whole. "Obviously it helps that they might know me," he says, and "are going to show me their best side sometimes."
As for Moverman - a large, bald man whose tendency to wear a military-style jacket and boots makes him look fairly imposing - he can easily understand how police feel around civilians. "I've often been mistaken for a cop," he says. "People talk to me and think I'm undercover or off-duty."
Both men spent time with officers to prepare for the film, and both report being surprised by some encounters. Harrelson befriended two officers in particular, saying, "I've never gotten so close to cops, where you could just punch them on the arm and [joke] around with them, you know?"
That intimacy made it easier to discuss the movie's dark themes. Having witnessed the job's problems and temptations, Harrelson says the officers "had great insight into it" - not that Harrelson thinks they would be charitable toward a bad police officer in real life. "I think they see how it can happen, but I think they judge them quite severely," he says. "They don't have much time for bad cops."
Moverman, since making the film, has heard from officers with more intimate knowledge of the job's dark side. He recalls getting an e-mail from a man who was fired after being implicated in the Rampart scandal, "who said, 'I was [Harrelson's character] Dave Brown. I know I was Dave Brown. But I have reasons.' He was talking about an injury he sustained, paranoia, behavior he fell into. It was very moving.
"It brought up a very interesting thing for me," Moverman continues. "Our troops go to war, and we subscribe to 'We support our troops.' They come back with PTSD, and we're open to that, because they've done some awful things, maybe, seen some awful things." 
But in America's cities, "we have soldiers known as cops, policing the streets, doing this work that is basically an occupation in terms of the mentality of it, and they're suffering," Moverman says. "The level of PTSD with cops, the way families are torn apart, those things say something. Yet we don't go around saying, 'We support our cops.' Because we interact with them every day, and we fear them on a certain level."
Though he'd never excuse police brutality, Moverman argues it's merely "a symptom" of that occupation-like mind-set, of society's overall "power structure, what's becoming more of a caste system than a class system:. "Just like any military occupation, yYou put people in that environment, you basically cultivate the mentality of being under siege, and everyone around you is the enemy, you're going to have atrocities."
Harrelson, who rarely works with the same director twice, can't say enough good things about reteaming with Moverman, who directed him in 2009's "The Messenger." He's most impressed by Moverman's openness to on-the-spot inspiration. "A lot of directors are like, 'Here's your mark, say that line there, then pick up that glass.' There's no creativity from the actor in that. You're just an automaton."
According to Harrelson, Moverman - who doesn't rehearse scenes, and who tries to keep actors from meeting one another before shooting - is more flexible than other directors who welcome the occasional bit of ad-libbing. Harrelson recalls shooting a scene in which Brown, living in a hotel room after having hit bottom, urges his two young daughters not to give up on him. What was scripted as a one-page scene grew, Harrelson claims, into the equivalent of eight pages during the take. "When they walk out the door, the scene's [supposed to be] over," he explains. But Harrelson followed the daughters out, forcing the camera to follow. "Why would I let them go? I wouldn't.
"All of a sudden there are people moving, getting walkie-talkies, moving wires out of the way. People are jumping out of the way to not be seen on film," he says with a laugh. "We walked to the elevator, and had that whole uncomfortable scene at the elevator, and then they're gone."
That expanded scene proves crucial in establishing a relationship that, for both Harrelson and Moverman, seems more important than any on-screen depiction of outrageous on-the-job misconduct. In the end, this emphasis makes "Rampart" much more the story of a troubled man than a piece of political provocation. 
"The biggest surprise of all is that it's not about 'Will he keep his job?' or 'Will he get killed?' " Moverman says. "It's about what happens once your children say, 'Okay, we've lost hope for you.' Who else is there? Once you lose your family, who do you have?"

And the Beltwar Oscar goes to . . .

SECTION: OUTLOOK; Pg. B03

LENGTH: 1054 words

Uplifting, undeserving films get Oscars as routinely as "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" is ranked No. 1 on lists of great Washington movies. Forget uplift. Forget Jimmy Stewart's tears. The capital is crazier and more complicated than that, and its infinite variety has been celebrated in large and small ways onscreen for decades. How to recognize this onOscar Sunday? Ladies and gentlemen, the home-rule version of the Academy Awards.
BEST PICTURE:   "D.C. Cab" (1983). Gary Busey, Bill Maher and Mr. T are crass cabbies cruising through the underbelly of the capital in this countercultural bricolage. It's apolitical, ridiculous, colorful and sweaty, and you can almost smell the District's squalid summer heat. Mr. Smith wouldn't last a day. Featured lovingly: Cardozo Senior High School's marching band, the Florida Avenue Grill,go-go group the Junk Yard Band and singer Irene Cara (as herself) at the White House. 
BEST ACTOR IN A LEADING ROLE: Peter Sellersג[#x2c6][#x161], "Being There"  (1979). Platitudes are the currency of politics, and a deadpan Sellers transacts his way from humble gardener to president-in-waiting with help from Washington's elite. The film was shot partly on North Capitol Street and 14th Street NW, and Sellers stands in for all this city's oddball neighbors who seem to be a stutter away from profundity.
BEST ACTRESS IN A LEADING ROLE:Cher,"Suspect"(1987). This award may be less for her acting and more for her humidified perm, dowdy wardrobe and courtroom camp. But this movie is also worth a watch for the art direction, which authentically renders parts of the city in shades of bureaucrat beige and judiciary brown.
BEST ACTOR IN A SUPPORTING ROLE:  Gary Oldmanג[#x2c6][#x161],  "The Contender"  (2000). He takes the bilious partisanship of Capitol Hill and fashions a savage portrait of a congressman intoxicated by his own incumbency. Watch how he tears into the rare flesh of his steak lunch while meeting with Joan Allen, who plays the vice presidential nominee he's vowed to torpedo in the name of political revenge.
BEST ACTRESS IN A SUPPORTING ROLE:  Sigourney Weaverג[#x2c6][#x161],  "Dave"   (1993). Real first ladies are polished and inoffensive. Weaver's first lady, estranged from the president and embittered by her ceremonious position, allows us to imagine the private frustrations of co-occupying the highest office in the land. Perhaps Michelle can sometimes relate.
BEST SCREENPLAY:"Born Yesterday"(1950). This fizzy adaptation of Garson Kanin's Broadway play skewers the coziness of congressmen, corporations and journalists. One of William Holden's speeches still stings 62 years later: "You know, when you live in Washington, it's enough to break your heart. You see a perfect piece of machinery: the democratic structure. And someone's always tampering with it, trying to make it hit the jackpot."
BEST PORTRAYAL OF A REAL PRESIDENT:  Dan Hedayaג[#x2c6][#x161], "Dick"  (1999). In this goofy, transcendent satire of Watergate, Hedaya's Richard Nixon is a hunched, tic-ridden goon who spares no man (and no man's best friend) from his bumbling wrath: "Checkers! Shut up or I'll feed you to the Chinese!"
WORST PORTRAYAL OF A REAL PRESIDENT: Charlton Hestonג[#x2c6][#x161], "The President's Lady"  (1953). He had yet to play Moses as a thundering demigod, but in this movie it looks like Heston was getting warmed up for it. He imbues his Andrew Jackson with an affected, quaking gravitas that clashes with the pedestrian story line. Do we care how the seventh president met and courted his wife? Zzzzz.
BEST INVOCATION OF A STATUE:  "The More the Merrier" (1943). In this romantic comedy set in a crowded sublet at 1708 D St. NW during the World War II housing shortage, Charles Coburn's character is a fan of repeating the famous command of Adm. David Farragut, immortalized in his own square at 17th and Connecticut: "Damn the torpedoes! Full speed ahead!" Required viewing for anyone in a group house.
BEST ALTERNATIVE NATIONAL ANTHEM:  "Man in Motion," from "St. Elmo's Fire"  (1985). The Brat Pack got angsty in Georgetown, and we got John Parr's No. 1 single about a Canadian wheelchair athlete who had nothing to do with the film. Skip the movie and go for a run (or a ride) while listening to its majestic lyrics: "I can see a new horizon underneath the blazing sky/I'll be where the eagle's flying, higher and higher!"
BEST D.C. MOVIE NOT SET IN D.C.:   "Three Days of the Condor"   (1975). A paranoid thriller starring Robert Redford as an endangered CIA officer lurking in the shadows of New York. The haunting final scene - in which his superior suggests that a government will do anything to secure an oil supply - is set in Midtown Manhattan but evokes intra-governmental power struggles between the Beltway and the Big Apple.
BEST CAMEO BY A POLITICIAN: Rep. Ron Paul (R-Tex.), "Brֳ¼no"  (2009). The once and futurepresidential candidatewas somehow lured into a Washington hotel room for an interview with Sacha Baron Cohen's Austrian TV personality. Paul stays remarkably polite and on-message, even as Cohen's behavior gets more farcical and flirty. When Cohen drops trou, though, Paul snaps. As we all would.
BEST PATENT: Flubberג[#x2c6][#x161], from "The Absent-Minded Professor" (1961). Duringthe final sequence of this Disney classic, Fred MacMurray pilots his airborne Model T around the Washington Monument and onto the south lawn of the White House to introduce his flying-rubber invention to the Pentagon. The joint chiefs of staff then wrestle each other to claim flubber for their own branch of the military.
BEST WASHINGTON MOVIE YOU'VE NEVER SEEN:  "The President's Analyst" (1967). James Coburn stars as the chief executive's shrink, a seersuckered "super-specialist in the field of super egos," asthe trailer calls him. Assuming that he's privy to ultra-classified information (instead of the president's mundane insecurities), enemies of the United States engage Coburn in a caper that unfolds like an acid trip set to Sousa-esque cymbal crashes and drumbeats. Coburn, in the last scene, brandishes a machine gun as he fights the mercenaries of the film's central villainous entity: not Russia, not China, but the phone company. Required viewing for Comcast customers.

NATO personnel pulled atministries

DATELINE: KABUL

KABUL - The top U.S. commander in Afghanistan on Saturday recalled all NATO personnel working in Afghan ministries in the Kabul area - a bold and potentially divisive response to thekilling of two American service members by an Afghan security official in the country's fortified Interior Ministry earlier in the day.
Marine Gen. John R. Allen's directive comes five days after U.S. military personnel burned a pile of Korans at the largest military base in Afghanistan in an apparently inadvertent act that set off violent protests across the country. More than 25 Afghans have died in those demonstrations, and four NATO soldiers have been killed by men wearing Afghan security uniforms since Thursday, when the Taliban urged Afghan soldiers and police to turn their weapons on their Western counterparts. 
The week's events have exposed a core vulnerability of the Obama administration's strategy for winding down the decade-long Afghan war: a fraying trust between two presumed allies who must depend on each other to keep the insurgency at bay. 
Although mutual suspicions have been building for some time, the Koran burnings followed by the apparent revenge killings of U.S. military personnel will make it much harder for both sides to agree in the coming weeks on the specific terms and timetable of NATO's planned withdrawal from Afghanistan by the end of 2014. 
NATO leaders are scheduled to hold a summit in May in Chicago, where they had hoped to finalize details of the withdrawal and the gradual handover of security responsibilities to Afghan forces, as well as report progress in fledgling negotiations with the Taliban.
But inflamed public anger among all sides could force a reassessment of those plans. Afghan patience is wearing thin with repeated acts of cultural insensitivity by foreign troops. Meanwhile, Americans and Europeans are growing increasingly resentful of the mounting number of treacherous attacks by Afghan forces they are trying to train. 
The escalating tension here prompted apologies for the Koran burning from President Obama and several top U.S. defense officials. But demonstrations continued unabated Saturday, even before U.S. officials reported that an Afghan security officer had killed an American colonel and major in one of Kabul's most important and most impenetrable ministries. 
The two men, whose names have not been released, were shot in the back of the head while working at their desks. 
Within hours of the attack, Allen recalled Western advisers from Afghan ministries, citing "obvious force protection reasons." The decision will affect several hundred officials who work with the Afghan military and with a host of other government agencies, such as the education and agriculture ministries.
Fratricide has been a growing problem between Afghan soldiers and their foreign counterparts here. In the past, Western military advisers were told to operate cautiously after such incidents, but Allen's decision represents the first time a commander has publicly withdrawn personnel from their posts for fear of attacks by men in Afghan uniforms.
The Taliban promptly asserted responsibility for Saturday's attack, saying the shooter was an insurgent who had infiltrated the Afghan security forces. 
Western military advisers were warned of a heightened risk of fratricide this week and told to stay out of Afghan ministries unless their activities were "mission critical."
Although Allen's announcement will have the most direct impact on those managing Afghan military policy from Kabul, the relationship between Afghan and U.S. service members who live and fight alongside one another far from the capital has also turned icy this week. On shared bases in eastern Afghanistan, U.S. military commanders ordered their troops to keep their distance from the Afghan counterparts until tension dissipated.
"The mission requires us to spend time with our Afghan counterparts, and lately we haven't been able to do that," said one military official in the east who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
NATO forces will continue to withdraw troops from Afghanistan through 2014, and the United States is expected to rely increasingly on small teams of advisers who will assist Afghan soldiers as they assume control of the country's most volatile provinces. But if the military partnership continues to sour, some wonder whether those advisers will be able to operate safely and effectively without the support of a vast Western security apparatus. 
Violent protests began outside Bagram air base early Tuesday after the incineration of Muslim holy books was discovered by Afghan employees. Those demonstrations have rattled the already fragile alliance between NATO forces and the people and government of Afghanistan. Afghan lawmakers have asked that the culprits be tried in an Islamic court. 
Allen said in a statement that the investigation into the Koran burning is ongoing. "Working together with the Afghan leadership is the only way for us to correct this major error and ensure that it never happens again," he said.
He has apologized profusely for the incident, which some officials said involved Korans confiscated from a prison near the Bagram base because they were suspected of being used to pass instigative messages. 
In addition to Allen's statements and Obama's apology to Afghan President Hamid Karzai, the U.S. military has pledged new training to avoid similar mistakes. But the outreach has done little to quell the anger surging through Afghanistan and other parts of the world over an act that Muslims consider a desecration.
U.S. officials say they are disappointed that Karzai has not more vehemently demanded an end to anti-American protests and accepted the U.S. apologies. Karzai issued a statement urging Afghans "not to resort to violence" earlier in the week, but he has since struggled to balance domestic calls for retribution with American calls for reconciliation, declining to publicly offer Americans the kind of absolution that some officials think might put an end to the violence. 
Afghan Defense Minister Abdul Rahim Wardak called Defense Secretary Leon Panetta on Saturday to apologize for the killings of the two U.S. military officials and offer his condolences, Pentagon press secretary George Little said. Wardak added that Karzai was assembling a group of religious leaders, lawmakers and other officials to take urgent steps to protect NATO forces and curtail violence in the country.
Wardak and Interior Minister Bismillah Khan Mohammadi are scheduled to visit Washington on Thursday to meet with Panetta and other Pentagon officials.
For his part, Karzai seems keen on using the Koran-burning incident to press his case that Afghans should take responsibility for the U.S. detention facility at Bagram.
"The sooner you do the transfer of the prison, the less you will have problems and unfortunate incidents," Karzai said at a meeting with Deputy Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter on Wednesday.
At least three people were killed and dozens wounded Saturday when protests turned violent in Kunduz, a province in northern Afghanistan. One crowd tried to storm the U.N. compound there but was turned back by armed guards.
"Although caused by legitimate defense, the United Nations . . . regrets the casualties among the demonstrators and expresses condolences to the families of those who lost their lives," the U.N. Assistance Mission said in a written statement.

McDonnell in a wary dance with GOP right

LENGTH: 1537 words

DATELINE: RICHMOND

RICHMOND - Virginia Gov. Robert F. McDonnell met with Republican members of the General Assembly more than 60 times in the past month - from formal meetings to glitzy social gatherings at the Executive Mansion - and he often cautioned them to exercise restraint.
McDonnell warned his fellow Republicans to limit their socially conservative legislation and focus on job creation and the state budget, according to legislators. Otherwise, he said, they risked miring the sessionin needless disputes that would not benefit the GOP. He even signaled which bills he would support, a departure from previous practice.
"We know what he meant," said Sen. Bill Stanley (Franklin), a conservative Republican from Southside Virginia who attended some of the gatherings.
But apparently not everyone took his words to heart. The increasingly influential conservative wing of McDonnell's party - which now controls the state government in Richmond - has swiftly taken on abortion, adoption and guns. And no initiative was more politically perilous than the ultrasound bill softenedlast week after ferocious opposition that stretched beyond Virginia's borders. 
The governor moved quickly to limit http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/nitty-gritty-knocked-va-abortion-bill-off-the-fast-track/2012/02/23/gIQAU4KnWR_story.htmlany lasting political damage to his national profile, but scrutiny of socially conservative legislation united Democratsand bore out McDonnell's concerns. That legislative blunder also underscored McDonnell's quandary: how to strike a balance between the interests of his Virginia Republican allies and his own practical political needs.
McDonnell is a potential vice presidential contender, and national Republicans are counting on him to deliver Virginia - a swing state in recent years - to GOP presidential and U.S. Senate candidates in November.
Bob Holsworth, a former professor at Virginia Commonwealth University with a deep knowledge of state politics, said the governor has been successful at managing conflicting goals. "McDonnell is a national figure,'' Holsworth said. "He's simultaneously running two campaigns: one for his budget and other priorities and one a silent campaign for the vice presidency.''
McDonnell declined a request for an interview, and he has been careful not to be critical of Republican lawmakers.
"What I would say is, it's absolutely false to say there's been an overreach,'' McDonnell told reporters last week. "The story of this session will be what I said it would be a month and half ago: We're going to create more opportunities and more jobs.''

In the middle
McDonnell, who was once considered one of the most conservative legislators in the state House of Delegates, has surprised his critics by largely governing from the middle, as he campaigned. He has worked to shore up the state's economy, ease traffic congestion and boost education opportunities, lobbying legislators on such priorities as his first two-year budget (as opposed to the two-year budget he inherited from his Democratic predecessor in 2010).
But social issues have yielded the most-intense debates and garnered the most attention. The ultrasound legislation, for instance, drew the ire and ridicule of left-leaning cable shows and late-night comedians after it became clear that the bill would require women seeking an abortion to undergo a vaginal probe. McDonnell first backed the bill but later said he hadn't known all the details.
Mark Rozell, a political scientist at George Mason University, said McDonnell has spent his first two years as governor trying to strike a middle ground between conservatives and independents as he keeps an eye on his image.
"He's had a tough balancing act,'' he said. "But that's his style.''
As governor and head of the Republican Governors Association, McDonnell has developed a national following.He appears regularly on national news programs and headlines Lincoln Day dinners in swing states, balancing his centrist persona with his conservative roots.
But observers say that balance could be jeopardized by the General Assembly, where Republican leaders have set the agenda this session,including lifting a one-a-month limit on handgun purchases and implementing adoption guidelines that critics say discriminate against gay people.
Meanwhile, national Democrats have accused him of advancing a socially conservative agenda as he campaigns for GOP presidential contender Mitt Romney, a former Massachusetts governor.
McDonnell is pushing more than 100 bills this legislative session, but his aides and allies complain about a lack of media attention to some of his priorities, such as proposals to pump $2 billion into the state pension system and to make government more efficient. The governor and senior staff members have become defensive as Democrats and the media have focused attention on legislative Republicans' socially conservative measures.
McDonnell has said that 97 percent of the General Assembly's bills have been about issues he is emphasizing. To highlight his point, McDonnell issued a news release a few weeks ago in which he focused on the victories of some of his bills, and he cut a video to explain the session's important issues. He did not mention social issues in either.
"His preference is consistent with what he ran on: 'Bob's for Jobs,' '' Senate Majority Leader Thomas K. Norment Jr. (R-James City) said. "He respects the social agenda, but he thinks jobs and economic development are the priorities.''
Some political observers say the General Assembly's apparent move to the right might be good for McDonnell's political future. They say McDonnell's conservative bona fides would help Romney, who some Republicans say is not a true conservative.
"He needs a conservative to help him bolster his conservative credentials,'' national Republican strategist Ron Bonjean said.

The Senate takeover
In his first two years as governor, McDonnell had been frustrated bya Democratic-controlled Senate. His plans to expand charter schools, reform the retirement system and divert revenue to ease traffic congestion all died at the hands of Senate Democrats.
But Democrats were a buffer, too. They shielded him from conservative bills that easily passed the House but routinely died in the Senate. He never complained.
After November's elections, Republicans have a history-making 2-to-1 majority in the House and control of an evenly divided Senate because Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling (R) can cast tie-breaking votes. It's only the second time since the Civil War that the party has controlled the General Assembly and the governor's mansion.
McDonnell tried to set the tone immediately after the elections. He preached moderation to both sides in public statements ahead of what is considered to be the most important session of his term, the session in which legislators are considering his first two-year budget.
"To members of the majority, I say: 'Don't be arrogant. Don't overreach,' " he stated in his State of the Commonwealth address to the General Assembly.
But McDonnell has had to spend time behind the scenes reining in fellow Republicans, who continue to ask him to back highly divisive bills.
Del. Ben L. Cline (R-Rockbridge), co-chairman of the Conservative Caucus, which recently had breakfast with McDonnell at the mansion, said he is counting on the governor's support, although he knows McDonnell does not agree with all of the group's goals. "We're working together so we can pursue a conservative agenda,'' he said.
Bolling, who regularly attends daily Senate Republican caucus meetings, said he and McDonnell have conveyed a message of restraint. "They don't always listen," said Bolling, who added that the dissension could put McDonnell in a precarious situation.
"He set his agenda. That hasn't changed," Bolling said. "But you have 140 members, and they all have their own agenda."
Heading into elections last fall, Republicans campaigned on pocketbook issues, such as job creation, and said they didn't want to get tripped up by social issues during this year's session. They also worried about turning off crucial independent voters. But when they arrived in Richmond, GOP legislators responded to the pent-up demand to pass bills that had been stymied for years.
House Minority Leader David J. Toscano (D-Charlottesville) said McDonnell has told him, "I'm doing what I can" to restrain the push on social issues.
This year, in a significant move, McDonnell announced which bills he intended to sign, a break from past practice. On the one hand, he signaled his willingness to sign the adoption legislation and the bill to repeal the one-a-month limit on handgun purchases. On the other, he expressed opposition to two particularly controversial abortion and gun bills, and they died.
Republican lawmakers may yet ask McDonnell to sign highly charged bills that would ban state subsidies for poor womento abort fetuses with serious birth defects and would require voters to show photo identification at the polls.
"I don't think he had much effect,'' Senate Minority Leader Richard L. Saslaw (D-Fairfax) said. "I'm not seeing that they're listening to him."

In Vegas, an education in the mob mentality 

BYLINE: Philip Kennicott

SECTION: SUNDAY ARTS; Pg. E03

LENGTH: 2759 words

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS

The line between the experiential museum, with its high entertainment quotient and tech-heavy immersion in sound, video and gaming technology, and the theme park, with all of the above plus thrill rides, is an increasingly thin one. TheU.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, an early pioneer of the "you are there" approach, is clearly about education; the National Museum of the Marine Corps in Triangle, near the Quantico Marine Base, is more like Disneyland with artillery.
The new Mob Museumin Las Vegas, which opened Feb. 14, is a late-generation design that uses many of the same tools and techniques one finds at similar venues focused on subjects where popular culture and history are too intertwined to be unraveled. Think of the International Spy Museumor the Crime Museum (billed as "a must-see for CSI fans"), both in Washington and both conveniently located in a neighborhood near the Mall where the white marble of history blends into the neon lights of food, drink and fun. 
Visitors to the new Las Vegas attraction, which sits in the slightly tatty old downtown, a short cab ride from the main gambling strip, begin by taking the elevator to the third floor of a decommissioned federal post office and courthouse. The designers make the best of the institutional architecture to craft a conceit: You are being processed through the criminal justice system. One mini-exhibit offers the visitor a chance to be photographed in a "lineup," just as so many cons and perps in movies past have been paraded and scrutinized.
There's also a chance to squeeze the trigger on a terrifically loud noise-making machine gun and pull the lever on an old-fashioned slot machine.
But the surprise turns out to be the relatively dense educational material woven into the 17,000 square feet of exhibition space. The museum's design team includes key players from the creation of the Spy Museum, including creative director Dennis Barrie and designer Patrick Gallagher, but the new project feels better thought out and better contextualized. There is plenty of material that flirts with mob glamour, but it's also clear that the exhibits aim at telling the larger history of the mob and its influence in Las Vegas, a tricky subject given the prominent role of organized crime in creating and sustaining America's love affair with losing money.
"When we first started the project, this was going to be a Las Vegas-centered story," Barrie says during a tour of the $42 million museum. But the role of the mob in Las Vegas can't be disentangled from the larger role the mob played in controlling easily exploited industries (especially gambling, illegal alcohol and prostitution) throughout the country. So the story goes back and forth between the specific and the general, the local and the larger picture, in a way difficult to manage but essential to nuanced history telling.
The mob, we learn, emerges out of the immigrant communities that flocked to the cities of the East Coast more than a century ago. Prohibition gave it unprecedented opportunities for expansion; and by the 1920s, competing factions, and a new generation of young hoodlums restlessly chafing under old leadership, led to spectacular orgies of violence. The 1929 St. Valentine's Day Massacre was among them, and the museum proudly displays a brick wall that was riddled with bullet holes during the shooting (it was disassembled and partially sold piecemeal before making its way into private hands and, ultimately, into the new museum).
One might call this the fetish for indexicality, objects that have been literally imprinted by the subject matter to which they bear witness. Objects that carry the markings of actual violence or direct connection (through use or ownership) to crime have a strange frisson. In museums, photographs trump documents, and bullet-pocked bricks trump just about everything else.
One begins to wonder whether we are now living in the age of museum violence, an age in which museums devoted to various forms of coercive and destructive power (genocide, crime, militarism, mafia) are absorbing the limited reserves of attention span among audiences that might spend time indoors learning about complicated subjects. Art in the age of mechanical reproduction loses its allure. Old-fashioned history, without guns and gore, seems stale. So the creative cutting edge of museum design moves to subjects that are inherently and almost embarrassingly appealing to the idle spectator. Rome had its gladiator contests. America has museums of criminality.
The designers are playing a delicate game, harvesting the lurid while sowing the seeds of learning. It doesn't always work. A barber's chair from New York, where Albert Anastasia, head of the Gambino crime family, was killed in 1957, is billed as a prize piece. But it's in good shape and lacks the visceral imprint of other pieces - which forces the viewer to consider why it matters, why it has appeal. The answer is quasi-mystical: Because someone died here. But that teaches us little if anything. It becomes an icon of violence, but evidence of nothing.
Mementos, personal effects and photographs donated by prominent mob families of Las Vegas are also more troubling than illuminating. Art museums have been laundering money for almost two centuries, converting new wealth into social prestige; here the same process is enacted almost as a crude parody.
Nevertheless, a solid lesson in the history of the mob takes form, in part, perhaps, because the building in which the museum is located demands it. The former post office and courthouse is one of the few substantial and architecturally interesting buildings from old Las Vegas. It is a neoclassical masonry structure surrounded by low-end casinos and desultory civic buildings, but it was also the site of one of the famous 1950-52 Kefauver hearings, a Senate investigation into the mob that brought knowledge of its extent and brutality into the living rooms of ordinary Americans. The courtroom in which the Nov. 15, 1950, Las Vegas hearing was held has been restored and serves both as a movie theater for visitors and an anchor to the exhibition. The movie is poorly done, difficult to decipher and an awkward mix of reenactment and genuine footage. But the authenticity of the space seems to have encouraged the museum to keep the scales slightly tipped toward seriousness in the rest of the exhibition.
The Kefauver hearings helped chase mob activity out of other cities in the nation, into the waiting arms of Las Vegas. The dusty desert town already had gambling and sin aplenty, but it soon became an "open city," where mobsters of all ilks gathered without the bloody turf wars of previous years. The "skim" became standard practice, as men in suits with enormous pockets carried off the bounty of stupidity, spiriting away, tax-free, the money Americans were losing at the gambling tables. Celebrities lent their beauty and perverse credibility to the enterprise, and Las Vegas began to be what it is a today: the ultimate fabricated destination and consummate hustle.
All of this is covered. Sometimes, the nastier bits of local history are handled a bit like the rapid-fire, monotone warnings on TV commercials for medications - may cause lesions, vomiting and death - put forth so objectively and dutifully that the facts can't quite compete with the allure of mob wealth and bravado.
But at least they try, and if viewers discipline their own reactions, it's a reasonably educational experience. If nothing else, like so many things in Las Vegas, the house-of-mirrors surrealism of the subject and its presentation are part of the fun. Among the strange facts of the Mob Museum: The man who created the idea, championed it and now serves on its board is former Las Vegas mayor Oscar Goodman, who once suggested that people who scrawl graffiti should have their thumbs cut off on television. Goodman made his name as a prominent lawyer defending mobsters. Nobody is hiding this fact. Indeed, in Las Vegas, no one seems to think it is a bit strange.

Miscues tell the story again as Rams put away Patriots

BYLINE: Steven Goff

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. D05

LENGTH: 667 words

DATELINE: RICHMOND

RICHMOND - A 30-second burst crystallized_blankGeorge Mason's calamitous first half against _blankVirginia Commonwealth on Saturday.
_blankRyan Pearson's inbounds pass was intercepted at midcourt, leading to the Rams' eighth three-pointer. On the ensuing possession, another giveaway turned into a layup, a 20-point deficit and, for all practical purposes, the Patriots' second setback in four days, _blankan 89-77 loss at crackling Siegel Center.
On the final weekend of the Colonial Athletic Association's regular season, _blankGeorge Mason (23-8, 14-4) kept its poise for 10 minutes before succumbing to ferocious pressure. The Patriots did rally to within 11 points midway through the second half but couldn't replicate _blankthe extraordinary comeback inflicted on the Rams 11 days earlier in Fairfax. 
Although the Patriots are stumbling into the CAA tournament - and a possible semifinal meeting with VCU - "I don't think it will be a concern," said Pearson, who scored 24 points. "We've got a week to get ready. We've got a lot of practices ahead before the tournament, and I think we're going to get it right there."
As the No. 3 seed, the Patriots will play No. 6 _blankGeorgia State (20-10, 11-7) or No. 11 _blankHofstra (10-21, 3-15) in a quarterfinal next Saturday night at Richmond Coliseum.
Second-seeded VCU (25-6, 15-3) will face No. 7 Northeastern (13-16, 9-9) or No. 10 William & Mary (6-25, 4-14). First-place Drexel (25-5, 16-2), which has won 17 in a row, and No. 4 seed Old Dominion (19-12, 13-5) also earned byes.
_blankAfter losing at Northeastern in overtime Wednesday, the Patriots were undone Saturday by 14 first-half turnovers and 20 overall, increasing a seven-game total to 127 (18.1 per outing). It offset one of their best shooting performances of the season (53.1 percent).
The Patriots also were bruised by VCU's three-point shooting. The Rams made six of their first nine and 8 of 16 in the first half to build a 43-27 lead. _blankBradford Burgess and _blankTroy Daniels made five three-pointers apiece overall, and Burgess finished with a career-high 31 points in his 141st consecutive start, one shy of the Division I record set by Georgetown's Patrick Ewing from 1981 to 1985.
The Rams, who have won 14 of 15, drew inspiration from letting the first meeting slip from their grasp, culminating with a buzzer-beating three-pointer by Sherrod Wright.
They said they were also motivated by a pregame incident Saturday. Before the senior night ceremony honoring Burgess concluded, the Patriots took the court for warmups.
"We noticed it," VCU Coach Shaka Smart said. "We fed off of it."
The Rams turned to Daniels (17 points) for three three-pointers in the first four-plus minutes. After Burgess added a three-pointer for a nine-point advantage, George Mason answered with nine points in a row.
Burgess, however, stroked another three-pointer, and the Patriots committed several turnovers under full-court duress. The Rams took advantage with two layups, a dunk and Daniels's fourth three-pointer to extend the lead to 12.
The early three-pointers "defined the game," Daniels said.
For George Mason, the low point was Pearson's inbounds pass that was intercepted and, in an instant, turned into Burgess's three-pointer. Another turnover - part of five on six possessions -  led to _blankDarius Theus's layup and a 41-21 margin.
"They are the type of team that's going to have those runs," Patriots Coach Paul Hewitt said. "You try to do your best to avoid them, but if you hang in there, you are going to give yourself a chance."
The Patriots cut the deficit to 16 at the half and, after trailing by 23, made a 13-1 run to pull within 11. But Burgess nailed his fifth three-pointer and, over the last nine minutes, the teams combined to attempt 48 free throws. George Mason couldn't get closer than 10.
"We were down so much, we kept clawing back, we didn't give up," Pearson said. "I liked the heart my team showed, and now we are getting ready for the CAA tournament."

DATELINE: VIERA, FLA.

Reprinted from Wednesday's editions
VIERA, FLA. -  The traces of fresh blue and black ink peeked out from under the athletic tape wrapped around Wilson Ramos's left wrist. Ramos squatted behind a plate Tuesday morning, his first act during the first organized workout for Washington Nationals pitchers and catchers. Each time Ramos stabbed at a pitch, the ball nestled softly in his catcher's mitt, and the tattoo on his forearm moved, ever so slightly, closer toward his heart.
The tattoo, etched last week, contains a Bible verse in Spanish, Philippians 4:13, that Ramos translated as, "I put everything in Jesus, because he has my back." Emblazoned under the words is 11-11-11. On November 11, 2011, Venezuelan commandoes rescued Ramos from the men who approached him outside of his home, pointed guns at his head, threw him in a Chevy Captiva and held him captive for two days.  
"I feel like I'm living again," Ramos said. "I've got a new life."
Ramos came to spring training to start his second major league season and to further separate his ordeal from his career, to separate his recent past from his bright future. Ramos, 24, is one of the most promising pieces of the Nationals' foundation, and he wants to be defined by that and not by his kidnapping. Tuesday, he expressed gratitude that he had survived the abduction and confidence that it would not affect his baseball career. 
"I'm really, really happy to be here," Ramos said. 
Ramos wants to make baseball his sole focus, and he received his first spring assignment after the pitchers and catchers stretched: catching Stephen Strasburg's first side session of the camp. 
After 10 minutes, Strasburg had thrown his allotment of fastballs and change-ups. He walked to meet Ramos halfway between the plate and the mound, where they shook hands and half-hugged. 
Upon his arrival at spring training, the Nationals did not formally address the kidnapping with Ramos. They already received him in Washington in November, shortly after his rescue, and administered a full medical check-up. Tuesday, they wanted to let him move on. 
Manager Davey Johnson barely referenced Ramos's offseason to him. As Ramos caught pitches from Strasburg, Johnson sidled up to him and asked how much Ramos had played in the Venezuelan winter league following the kidnapping. A month and a half, Ramos responded. 
"That's indicative of, he's more comfortable getting on the field rather than talking to you guys about the kidnapping," Johnson said. "He wanted to get back in there and go play. It's over with. And I'm sure it's over with him.
"He's dealt with that good. He's in a good frame of mind. We were all scared to death, but I'm not one that deals too much in the past. I deal in the present. As far as I'm concerned, it's history."
Ramos did not hit well at first in Venezuela, but by the end he helped the Aragua Tigres win their playoff series. It was an important step in recovering. For Ramos, playing in Venezuela after the kidnapping - which he did under the protection of armed guards - allowed him a degree of mental stability. 
"I tried to clear my mind with baseball," Ramos said. "If I stayed in my house, I was thinking too much."
In a country plagued by crime and kidnappings, Ramos became the first major league player to be abducted. The challenge of returning to professional baseball after such an episode, performing under high pressure before thousands and thousands, has no precedent.
In one recent winter, Nationals backup catcher Jesus Flores, also Venezuelan, was carjacked at gunpoint in Venezuela. "I couldn't play well for a week or two weeks," Flores said. "His situation was harder, more difficult. It was more mental." 
Flores went home to play winter ball this year. Even before Ramos's kidnapping, Flores traveled with a bodyguard. 
"It doesn't mean that you're going to be protected," Flores said. "I'm not really going out or doing too much on the street because of the situation. 
"It could happen to anybody. The security is very bad. It's a very dangerous country right now. Wilson, I thought that he wasn't going to be alive after that situation. We were thinking the worst. We were thinking the worst."
After two harrowing days, Ramos emerged, safe and unharmed. His life had changed forever, and not only in bad ways. His family, as families do, had grown divided before the kidnappers snatched him. The incident united his family again, he said, and his brother, sister and mother are attaining visas to visit him.
Ramos's teammates this weekend greeted him with hugs and smiles. They told him how great it was to see him - "everybody is telling me that," Ramos said - but they do not directly mention the kidnapping. 
"They know I don't want to talk about that," Ramos said. "I just want to concentrate on baseball and help my team." 
When he jogged across a matrix of backfields Tuesday morning, Ramos inserted another layer between him and his kidnapping. During a drill designed to improve framing pitches, Ramos dropped a ball. Bullpen coach Nilson Robledo hollered, "Good glove!"
"Thank you, Robledo," Ramos said, laughing.
"Need some bubblegum on there," bullpen coach Jim Lett teased. 
Ramos finished the workout with batting practice. He focused on shortening the path of his swing, as Johnson had instructed. "He looked good doing it," Johnson said. After Ramos sprayed easy line drives, he walked out of the batting cage and packed his gear. 
Ramos hopped on the rear of a golf cart for the ride back to the clubhouse. He chuckled as he drove by two familiar faces. When Ramos stopped laughing, he looked to his left, at an empty, sun-splashed baseball diamond. The smile stayed on his face.

Data on tracing handguns are unreliable

SECTION: EDITORIAL COPY; Pg. A16

LENGTH: 237 words

Regarding Douglas Weil's Feb. 19 Local Opinions commentary, "A law that gun-rights advocates should be fighting to keep": 
About 15 years ago, Mr. Weil co-authored a study purporting to prove that Virginia's one-handgun-a-month law curbed interstate trafficking. Producing such studies was his job at the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, and he was good at it, although perhaps not so good as he now thinks in describing his study as "impossible to refute." 
As an employee of the National Rifle Association at the time, I thought it rather easy to refute and promptly did so. 
Mr. Weil's study, like many studies over the past two or three decades, was based on tracing data from what is now the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. 
Traces are sometimes useful for law enforcement. However, because of selection bias in finding and determining which guns to trace - sometimes intentional and sometimes not but always impossible   to correct or adjust for - no study based on tracing data is worth the paper it's printed on, regardless of how sophisticated or honest the analysis following the data collection. As the acronym has it, GIGO ("garbage in, garbage out"). 
Tracing data are simply incapable of supporting assertions that the Virginia law was either effective or ineffective.

WWII Navy ace; wife worked with charity groups

BYLINE: Matt Schudel

SECTION: METRO; Pg. C06

LENGTH: 719 words

Warren A. "Andy" Skon, 92, a retired Navy captain who was an ace fighter pilot in the Pacific theater during World War II, died Jan. 19 at his home in McLean.
His wife of 67 years, Hazel M. Skon, also 92, died three days later at their McLean home. Both had pneumonia, their daughter Nancy Jedele said.
Capt. Skon was a highly decorated pilot who took part in several major air-combat operations during his two years as a naval aviator in the Pacific. He participated in the Navy's first nighttime fighter actions from an aircraft carrier and was awarded the Navy Cross, the service's highest award for wartime valor, which is second only to the Medal of Honor among U.S. military awards. 
He was credited with shooting down seven Japanese airplanes during the war, making him an ace. (An ace is a pilot who downs at least five enemy aircraft.)
In 1943, when he was assigned to the USS Enterprise, Capt. Skon was the wingman to Edward H. "Butch" O'Hare, who was the Navy's first ace and who received the Medal of Honor in 1942.
On the night of Nov. 26, 1943, a formation of Japanese torpedo bombers was detected flying toward the Enterprise and other ships in what the Navy called Task Force 58 near the Gilbert Islands. O'Hare, Capt. Skon and other pilots scrambled into action to confront the enemy planes, downing several in the Navy's first nighttime airborne firefight.
Capt. Skon (then an ensign) was awarded the Navy Cross for his role in intercepting the enemy airplanes and repelling the attack. No ships in the U.S. group were seriously damaged.
The Navy Cross citation praised Capt. Skon's "outstanding courage, daring airmanship and devotion to duty" and said his "fighting spirit in the face of great peril was largely responsible for saving the carrier task group from serious damage."
The award was bittersweet, however, because in the midst of the battle, O'Hare was shot down and lost at sea. Neither he nor his plane was ever found.
The last person O'Hare spoke to, by radio, was Capt. Skon. As they were converging on a plane, Capt. Skon later told an Associated Press reporter, "Butch said, 'You take the side you want!' I said, 'I'll take the port.'
" 'Roger,' he said, and that was the last word he said.
"Then I saw tracers around his plane. I saw it sheer off and drop quickly below us."
O'Hare, for whom Chicago's O'Hare International Airport was later named, was one of the few Medal of Honor recipients to return to action and later die in battle.
Capt. Skon was later assigned to the aircraft carrier USS Hornet in the Pacific. Flying a F6F Hellcat, he shot down three Japanese planes, including two dive bombers, within a nine-day period in June 1944 that later became known as the "Great Marianas Turkey Shoot."
He downed two Japanese fighter planes on July 3, 1944, and two more on Sept. 21, for a total of seven. He damaged four other aircraft in aerial combat and, although it could not be confirmed, was believed to have shot down an eighth plane.
After the war, Capt. Skon was a Navy flight instructor and commanding officer of Navy fighter groups. He managed a Defense Department project in connection with the White House Communications Agency from 1967 to 1970. When he retired from the military in 1973, he was the Navy's assistant inspector general.
In addition to the Navy Cross, Capt. Skon's decorations included four awards of the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Meritorious Service Medal and eight Air Medals.
He later worked for 13 years for Wheeler Industries, a Northern Virginia defense contractor, on ship design projects.
Warren Andrew Skon was born Oct. 29, 1919, in St. Paul, Minn., and attended the University of Minnesota for two years before entering a Navy flight training program in 1942. He received a bachelor's degree in political science from George Washington University in 1966 and a master's degree in international affairs, also from GWU, in 1968. He also completed courses at the Naval War College in Newport, R.I.
His wife, the former Hazel Marie Nelson, was also born in St. Paul. She volunteered with Navy charity groups and, along with her husband, was a member of Redeemer Lutheran Church in McLean. They had lived in McLean since 1963.
Survivors include two daughters, Nancy Jedele of Laurel and Joy Maziarz of Quincy, Mass.; and a granddaughter.

DATELINE: IN DETROIT

Before there was rust, there was gleaming chrome. You can see it on display at the Henryhttp://www.thehenryford.org/index.aspx-URL- Ford Museum in Dearborn. Behold the voluptuous 1956 Chevrolet Bel Air convertible, bursting with movie-star glamour. Check out the 1959 Cadillac Eldorado, a rocket ship on wheels, fit for a titan of industry.
A small sign by the Caddie includes a quote:
"Cars 19 feet long, weighing two tons, are used to run a 118-pound housewife three blocks to the drugstore for a two-ounce package of bobby pins and lipstick." 
That's George Romney, 1955. He was a car executive then, running American Motors Corp., which bucked the Detroit tradition and tried to sell small cars.
Now http://www.washingtonpost.com/mitt-romney-2012-presidential-candidate/gIQANxIecO_topic.html-URL-his son Mitt is stumping across the state, trying to sell himself as an authentic Michigander. ("http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mitt-romney-in-michigan-at-detroits-ford-field-empty-seats-steal-thunder/2012/02/24/gIQA2vFmYR_story_1.html-URL-I love carshttp://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mitt-romney-in-michigan-at-detroits-ford-field-empty-seats-steal-thunder/2012/02/24/gIQA2vFmYR_story.html?hpid=z1-URL-http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mitt-romney-in-michigan-at-detroits-ford-field-empty-seats-steal-thunder/2012/02/24/gIQA2vFmYR_story.html?hpid=z1" is one of his messages, and more than once he has said he likes the state because "the trees are the right height.")
He http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/election-2012/post/mitt-romney-rails-against-labor-stooges/2012/02/23/gIQASoxqWR_blog.html-URL-told an audience in Milford on Thursday night that he was born in Detroit. His family lived in a "lovely" house in a nice neighborhood in Palmer Park. After his family moved away, Romney said, the house became an eyesore - and it was demolished.
A connection to demolition, however distant, gives a candidate in Michigan a modicum of street cred. So many houses in Detroit have been bulldozed that urban agriculture is making a comeback, and "grown in Detroit" is a selling point at the city's farmers market.
The candidates also need to make a connection with Michigan's blue-collar workers. http://www.washingtonpost.com/rick-santorum-2012-presidential-candidate/gIQA61AHdO_topic.html-URL-Rick Santorum, who comes from a less privileged background than Romney, took a shot at President Obama on Saturday for saying that every American deserves a college education. He suggested that Obama wanted to indoctrinate students in the liberal ideology taught in college. What many people need, he said, is training for a job.
A Santorum victory Tuesday would be a tremendous blow to Romney, who has spent years building his political machine here but saw his once-commanding lead in the polls disappear this month as Santorum surged to the top in all the surveys. http://www.insidemichiganpolitics.com/About.aspx-URL-Bill Ballenger, editor of the Inside Michigan Politics newsletter, said of Romney: "He must have been tearing his hair out. How could this happen? He found himself 15 points behind a guy who had no history in Michigan, who nobody knew."
Santorum won supporters such as Kelly Gingras, 45, a heavy-equipment operator. "He has more of my values," Gingras said one evening last week in an Ypsilanti tattoo parlor. "Just limit government."
Romney has closed the gap in the most recent polls. But it's easy to find undecided voters even after all these months of campaigning.
Timothy King, a retired autoworker from Ypsilanti, said his choice is "anybody but Obama." He said: "Socialism didn't work in Europe. It's not going to work here."
Frank Crouse, 72, of Hartland went to hear Romney as an undecided voter but came away a convert - because he liked the way Romney didn't use a teleprompter.
"He won me over," he said. "It seemed to come from the heart."

Tarnished state still important prize
Michigan remains a critical state for anyone wanting to become president, but its importance is eroding. It had 18 electoral votes in 2000, and 17 electoral votes four years ago, but will have only 16 this time. The state's population declinedhttp://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/26000.html-URL- in the most recent census.
This would have been hard to imagine half a century ago. 
This was the state that built dream machines, giving people an intoxicating combination of speed and mobility. Highways were new, gas was cheap. Somewhere along the line, the American auto industry fell victim to its own success. It became complacent. Innovation was feared rather than embraced.
"We sort of killed off our entrepreneurial spirit," Gov. http://www.michigan.gov/snyder-URL-Rick Snyder said last week in his Lansing office in the George W. Romney Building, overlooking the state Capitol. "We rode this thing too long."
Between an employment peak in the spring of 2000 and the bottom of the recession in 2009, Michigan lost 860,000 jobs, according to Michigan State University economics professor Charles Ballard.
"Which just takes your breath away," Ballard said. "There's no way to avoid the fact that the first decade of this century was pretty awful."
There are positive trends amid the wreckage. The auto industry is on the rebound. http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/gm-once-again-top-selling-automaker/2012/01/19/gIQAp3b1BQ_story.html-URL-General Motors, which along with Chrysler was bailed out by federal loans three years ago, turned a $7.6 billion profit last year, the biggest in the company's history.
"Our best days are still ahead of us," Snyder said. 
His Michigan is not a tragic place, but one that is geographically blessed. The climate, he said, is tempered by the "Great Lakes effect." The Ice Age glaciers left behind rich soil in the southern half of the state and countless small lakes. 
Snyder does not talk of rust but rather of asparagus. Blueberries. Cherries. Those are the ABCs of Michigan's diverse agriculture, he said - one of the state's overlooked economic strengths.
Michigan is geographically peculiar. It's a Midwestern state framed by water, with two distinct peninsulas that strain to touch each other at their tips. The state has been a crossroads since the days of the fur trappers.
The Upper Peninsula is very rural, very conservative - a place where people take their gun rights seriously and home-school their children. The western counties of the Lower Peninsula, along Lake Michigan, have many social conservatives, and Santorum has been campaigning there vigorously.
To the east are counties where Romney racked up votes in his primary win four years ago over John McCain. And in the southeast is Detroit, a Democratic stronghold with an African American majority. Just west of Detroit, in Dearborn, is a thriving Arab American community.
Michigan is quirky when it comes to presidential primaries. The state does not have party registration, and so anyone can vote in the primary, including self-identified Democrats. The state has a history of primaries in which the winner didn't go on to get the nomination - such as George H.W. Bush in 1980, Jesse Jackson in 1988, McCain in 2000 and Romney in 2008.
The Democrats have won Michigan in the past five presidential contests. Obama trounced McCain here four years ago and is favored to win here in the fall. Michigan is essential to his electoral map.
But the outcome this fall is hardly automatic, even though the Republican candidates' opposition to the auto bailout would seem to be a serious handicap for any potential nominee. This is, by some measures, a Republican state now. Snyder is a Republican, having won office during a GOP landslide in 2010, when the party gained control of the state legislature and won nine of the 15 U.S. House races.
The head of Romney's Michigan operation, Bill Schuette, the state's attorney general, said the Democrats have taken Michigan for granted for too long. He noted that Obama flew here for a speech in Ann Arbor right after his http://www.washingtonpost.com/state-of-the-union-URL-State of the Union address.
"They're paying special attention to Michigan because they know that with Mitt Romney as the Republican candidate we can win this state for the first time since '88," Schuette said.

'We need some help'
Michigan has an uneasy relationship with change. The state has a lot of people who were born here, have always lived here and will someday die here, said historian Bob Casey of the Henry Ford Museum.
"Michigan has become, to its detriment, an insular state," Casey said.
Keith Davis, 42, is a chef at Janet's Lunch, in Grosse Pointe, and the change he's seen in his life has been brutal. The old-fashioned diner is just a few blocks from the Detroit city line, where the landscape instantly deteriorates into decay and ruin.
He grew up in that neighborhood and in 1997 told his parents they should sell their home and get out. He told them: "Look at these punks. They're selling dope all night." His parents sold out. Now he lives right at the city line. He said he'll vote for Obama. "He's going to need eight years to maybe get things even halfway decent," he said.
After the Romney event in Milford, tea party supporter Gary Howe, 72, said he still hadn't made up his mind about how he'll vote Tuesday. Howe thinks the government is a complete mess. "We need some help," he said.
He speaks as a man from Flint, a once-wealthy city that has become a prime example of what can happen when a manufacturing economy goes into decline. He still owns his parents' house there, the home he was born into. The neighborhood, he said, "is not real bad yet."
This past summer he put it on the market. He's had two offers. The first was for $49,500. The second was for less than that.
He won't sell for that kind of money. Somewhere out there, surely, is a better offer.

Packed sidewalks are part of weekend life on Capitol Hill's Eighth Street,a gentrifying half-mile of sleek pubs and high-end comfort food restaurants. But in recent months, the biggest sidewalk scene has been at 9 a.m. on Sundays, when hundreds of people pour into a retro movie theaterwith a huge, white cross over the door.
The mostly 20-something crowd looks like a bushy-tailed version of the people who might have been - and probably were - on Eighth Street the night before or who during the week do partisan battle up the street as congressional staffers or lobbyists or White House aides.
Many members of this unusual church are on Capitol Hill for the same reason as their pastor, Mark Batterson, a one-time University of Chicago basketball player who felt God called him from the Midwest to the District in 1995 to "influence the influencers." 
Batterson, 42, seems to be doing just that.
His seven-site National Community Church is one of the fastest-growing ministries in the city, having ecently purchased $15 million worth of real estate properties - that it owns debt-free across Capitol Hill at a time when it's rare for a city church to expand. Close watchers of the evangelical pastor scene say Batterson is among the most promising leaders for the next generation.
"I'm not sure if anyone could make a bet as to whether he'll reach the rare echelon of the top two or three pastors, but he's clearly putting himself in the hunt," said David Kinnaman, president of the evangelical polling and research firm the Barna Group.
Batterson's typical Sunday crowd is hardly typical. In a back row of the movie theater, which the church is restoring, sits an aide to a Republican presidential contender. With the place packed to overflow, as usual, a jeans-clad member of President Obama's faith-outreach team sits cross-legged on the floor. Leaders of national advocacy groups from across the spectrum dot the audience.
The type of people whose days are jammed with partisan power politics, they love Batterson in part because he has embraced a credo that is gaining popularity among younger conservative evangelicals: Lay off the politics, particularly of the divisive kind.

The no-politics rule
Beyond his no-politics-in-church rule, a key hallmark of Batterson's is how he blends orthodoxy and innovation.
Raised in the Assemblies of God denomination, he has created a nondenominational megachurch that actually has no church, in the conventional sense. His 3,000 members meet in movie theaters, coffee shops and, he hopes soon, a large concert venue.
As an aspiring filmmaker who came to faith through a movie, he thrives on popular culture, from the arts to the slickest marketing. His staff includes pastors for visual story-telling, or multimedia, and branding. Outreach magazine, which covers growing churches, named the National Community Church one of the country's most influential.
Walking into church one recent Sunday in jeans, a cowboy-style shirt and a stubbly goatee, the 6-foot-3 former shooting guard hugs people left and right as he walks to the front.
In sermons, even after thunderous contemporary Christian rock from a live band and even with ushers gathering tithes in faux popcorn boxes, his style is casual but intimate, sort of like it was his turn to talk at a 12-step meeting.
No judgment, no talking down, no politics, no policies, except one: This worshiping God business is no game, no metaphor. His best-selling books and sermons are filled with people who listened to what they believe were direct orders from God: to drive to a friend's house in the middle of the night, or to get on their knees in the Cleveland airport (that one happened to Batterson). The point is to obey God.
"Prayer is not about letting God know your will; it's about completely submitting to him. You die to yourself," he said one recent Sunday.

A wide reach
Batterson is already a popular author and blogger who speaks before tens of thousands of evangelical pastors each year. His new book, "The Circle Maker," was picked by Christian publishing giant Zondervan as one of its top three to promote this year to tens of thousands of churches. The book, a how-to on prayer, debuted as a New York Times bestseller in the advice category and sold 50,000 copies in its first two months.
The devout from both the Obama crowd and the Liberty University crew seem attracted to Batterson's focus: finding a way in a secular culture to have an intense, submissive relationship with God. In a town filled with strivers, Batterson teaches that if you pray deeply and specifically, God will provide that job, that piece of real estate.
"God is for you," he writes in "The Circle Maker." "If you don't believe that, then you'll pray small timid prayers."
Batterson came to Washington to take over a church of 19 people after a small church he tried to start in Chicago failed. Five years later, the church, using the theater at Union Station, had grown to 500 followers.
Batterson and some experts think his business model may be the future of urban Christianity: Make "church" the places where people already are. He has been known as the icon for the "theater church movement" for a decade.
"In an urban environment, a church building is a thing of the past. We'll approach this like a developer," he said in an interview.
Prayer circles are another Batterson trademark. He talks about walking around neighborhoods or buildings in prayer, meditating on things he thinks God is calling him to do in those places. Sometimes the prayer circles are in his mind. The concept is to keep prayers, and goals, specific. "The Circle Maker" tells of a 4.7-mile prayer walk he did one sweaty August day in 1996, a route that now encompasses all the properties the church would eventually acquire.
This is classic Batterson: an orthodox concept - a real God, who intervenes in your life if you seek His will - presented in motivational language. The church's core values and beliefs include the literal truth of Jesus's resurrection and the inherently sinful state of humans, as well as self-helpy axioms such as "Everything is an experiment" and "Do it right and do it big."
Many churches have "small groups" for prayer and support; National Community Church has a "free-market society," encouraging people to form groups based on shared interests, from the Book of Job to milkshakes and stopping sex trafficking. Congregants can put the group together. If it flies, great; if not, kill it.
Batterson is known for pithy sayings: We don't brainstorm, we praystorm. Coffee shops are post-modern wells, like the ones where biblical characters would gather. If Christianity was a company, his church would want to be R&D.
Kinnaman said it's this merger of faith and communications skills that make Batterson a pastor who can thrive in today's culture.
"No one is quite putting the package together quite like he is," Kinnaman said. "He has this extra optimism and hopefulness at a time when people are really struggling."

Protesters, police have had tense relations

As tents and Occupy D.C. protesters filled two federal parks in the District in early November, a homeland security "bulletin" was sent to dozens of local law-enforcement officials.
Authorities in Arizona had discovered an article titled "When Should You Shoot a Cop" at an Occupy Phoenix encampment, the notice warned.
U.S. Park Police Capt. Kathleen Harasek, commander of D.C.'s Central District, wrote to senior agency officials: "We need to remember that just because we didn't find the same article here, doesn't mean the sentiment doesn't exist among our group."
The e-mail, revealed in documents obtained by The Washington Post under the Freedom of Information Act, sparked concern about the possibility of a kind of violence that never materialized. There were no reported shootings aimed at police at an Occupy protest locally or nationally, and the vast majority of them remained peaceful. 
But the message set the stage for the unpredictable and tense relationship that has existed between some protesters and police in the District throughout the nearly five-month protest. 
An examination of the local police response to the movement offers a glimpse at the challenges facing officers as they monitor a round-the-clock protest in an electronic age that allows the world to watch in real time via the Internet.
 As police in other cities moved in quickly to shut down camps in the early weeks of the Occupy Wall Street movement, officers clashed with protesters in some well-publicized episodes of violence. But for months, the Park Police here, aware of the international spotlight, largely held back. There were some heated exchanges as small bands of troublemakers fed off the hostilitybetween protesters and police elsewhere.
More than a half-dozen officers allegedly were assaulted during the past two months, including one who was reportedly struck in the head with a bottle when Park Police swept through McPherson Square and Freedom Plaza on Feb. 4 and 5 to enforce an anti-camping ban.Online videos show police standing stone-facedas some Occupiers in the District called them wife beaters, "scum" and yelled other insults. Protesters also uploaded profanity-laced videos on YouTube, showing officers' faces and badge numbers.
William J. Johnson, executive director of the National Association of Police Organizations, said taunts from protesters come with the job in the nation's capital.
"Realistically, they are not going to march into Congress and spit on a congressman or throw urine at a senator," Johnson said. "It's the individual officer that is really the face of the government or the tangible government presence during a protest."
Occupy D.C. protesters say their mistrust of police can be traced to allegations of police brutality this year, including the use of pepper spray on students at the University of California at Davis. Locally, they point to videos of Park Police swinging batons, trying to pushpeople away from McPherson Square three weeks ago.
"I've called them pigs, because they can be pigs," said Ryan Lash, 25, who was arrested and subdued with a police Taser gunin McPherson Square last month. "There is sometimes a lot of anger, especially when we see violence against fellow protesters."
D.C. Police Chief Cathy Lanier said that only a few of the protesters seem to target the police but that "they are the worst. They taunt, they get in officers' faces, they throw urine. They want to be treated with respect, but they don't treat us with respect."
On Dec. 22, a Park Police officer was kicked in the groin and another in the chest when they attempted to make an arrest in McPherson Square, according to court documents.
Three weeks later, when Park Police moved to enforce the no-camping ban at McPherson Square, an officer was taken to the hospital with minor injuries, after a suspect threw a "3 to 4 foot" bamboo stick at him, according to police reports.
The suspect, Nathan J. Gorecki, has been charged with assaulting an officer. He denies the charge. Gorecki said police broke his elbow, ribs and fractured his skull when they tackled him during the arrest, but Park Police said they were unable to confirm the extent of his injuries.
On the same day, another officer received "significant bodily injuries" after Jeremiah DeSousa allegedly threw a bottle at him. DeSousa was charged with assaulting a police officer. He also denies the charges, according to court documents.
Park Service e-mails and documents show that on Oct. 19, three weeks after the first protest began, officials were worried about the potential for violence. Leaders of the Downtown Business Improvement District wrote Park Service officials to warn that protesters were "stacking lumber" possibly to use as "weapons against law enforcement," a concern that turned out to be unfounded.
A month later senior Park Service officials also appeared to be extra cautious when they asked D.C. police not to go into McPherson Square one night because the police presence might "escalate the tenuous relationship" between the two sides, according to e-mails.
Though some of the tension has subsided, police are concerned that a new wave of protesters from other states could again test no-camping rules in downtown parks.
But Sam Jewler, a protest organizer from the District, said protesters have turned their focus to building community support, including new actions aimed at foreclosure prevention, and he said he expects fewer skirmishes with police.
"Things happened in the park, but I don't think it should reflect equally on the movement," Jewler said, adding that some of the out-of-town troublemakers have left. "It's a public park, and there were some people we didn't know how to deal with."
But the uneasy relationship remains.
Protesters and police got into a shoving match Feb. 10 outside of the Conservative Political Action Conference in Woodley Park, resulting in police and protesters landing on the ground. When an officer on horseback tried to push a protester away from the scene, the young man hurled obscenities and tried to block the horse, setting up a daring game of chicken between him and the 1,200-pound animal.
"I would listen if they were nicer," said the protester, who identified himself as Nate. "They are trying to taunt me into doing something. Would you be pushed around and just stand there?"
Kenneth Eisold, a New York-based psychoanalyst who has written about Occupy Wall Street, said some protesters appear to be lashing out because their grievances, which include bridging the economic divide between the rich and the poor, have yet to be addressed. Many protesters, he said, do not realize it took years for 1960s protesters to see some progress during the civil rights and anti-war era.
"They can't occupy the external spaces anymore and they themselves don't know where to go from this point, so the frustration leads to outbursts," Eisold said. "They get angry at the police because they need to ventilate in some ways."
Lt. Robert T. Glover of the D.C. police's Special Operations Bureau said the agency will continue trying to communicate and work with the protesters to defuse potential problems before injury or arrests. Glover spent a week on medical leave after spraining his wrist during the scuffle outside the Woodley Park conference.
"I believe that officers are aware of the previous assaults on officers, and that awareness has led to even better de-escalation techniques," he said.

Suspect arrested in Hells Angels killing
Police have arrested a suspect in the death of a motorcycle gang member, ending a months-long search for the victim's fellow Hells Angels member who has been wanted since the fatal shooting at a California funeral. 
San Jose police Sgt. Jason Dwyer said Steve Ruiz was taken into custody Saturday night at a motel in Fremont by members of the department's covert response unit.
Ruiz, 38, had been the subject of a widespread manhunt since Steve Tausan was fatally shot during a funeral service for Jeffrey "Jethro" Pettigrew at Oak Hill Cemetery in San Jose on Oct. 15.
Police thinksay Ruiz killed Tausan when a fight broke out at the funeral.
Tausan, 52, was one of 4,000 people attending services for Pettigrew, the president of the Hells Angels San Jose chapter, who was killed during a brawl with a rival biker gang in a Nevada casino on Sept. 23.
Service weapon was used in N.J. boy's shooting: Prosecutors in New Jersey say the 14-year-old son of a corrections officer used her service weapon to fatally shoot his younger half-brother. The Jersey Journal reported that Hasson George, 12, was shot once in the chest inside the officer's Jersey City apartment Friday night with a semiautomatic pistol issued to the corrections officer, Shaara Green-Simms, 38, who works at the county jail.Hudson County Prosecutor Edward DeFazio Officials said Green-Simms is the 14-year-old's mother and the boys have the same father. 
Girl dies after school fight: An 11-year-old girl died following an after-school fight at an elementary school in Long Beach, Calif., but authorities say they have no immediate plans for arrests. Police said Saturday night that the girl died at a hospital hours after the fight with another 11-year-old girl outside the school. Authorities have not released the girl's name but the Long Beach Press Telegram said friends identified her as Joanna Ramos.
Times Square vendor to run for Congress: A Times Square vendor who alerted police to an attempted car bombing in 2010 is announcing his candidacy for Congress. Duane Jackson said his brush with terrorism and celebrity taught him that it made sense to get involved. The 59-year-old Navy veteran plans to announce his candidacy Monday morning in Buchanan, in Westchester County north of New York City. The Democrat hopes to unseat freshman Republican Nan Hayworth in New York's 19th Congressional District.

Family still seeks justice in 'friendly fire' death

BYLINE: Tom Jackman

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A01

LENGTH: 5153 words

Dave Sharrett Sr. still sees his son in his dreams.
In one, the son is home on leave from Iraq, a warrior, a man. His boots are caked in mud. His fatigues are dirty. "And as we talk," Sharrett says, "I realize I have to tell him that I know how he is going to die."
Four years after Pfc. David H. Sharrett II of Oakton bled to death near a clump of scrub trees in Balad, Iraq, the father finally knows how the son was killed: shot by his own lieutenant in a case of "friendly fire." But he still doesn't know why.
Sharrett, for years a beloved English teacher at Langley High School, simply wanted the full story and some accountability. He did not see that as a massive imposition on the Army brass. 
Now Sharrett wonders, as he prepares to meet this week with the secretary of the Army, whether justice will ever be done.
Justice is the final thing he owes his son, a bear of a man who played defensive end atOakton High School, bounced aroundFairfax Countyfor several years and then joined the Army in 2006, at age 26, in his quest to find himself as a man.
A year after Dave Sharrett II died, his parents, Vicki and Dave Sr., were nearly at peace. They had come to accept the Army's explanation of how it all happened in the "fog of war." They were confident in the Army's promises of transparency and accountability for the lieutenant who fired the fatal shot.
Then came the third knock on the door.
After amemorial service for their son at Fort Campbell, Ky., in February 2009, soldiers who fought alongside him paid a surprise visit to the Sharretts. In a cramped room at the Holiday Inn Express, the soldiers used words such as "cover-up" and "lies." They brought video recordings shot from aircraft high above the chaos that showed how Dave Sharrett II and two other American soldiers were killed.
The flames of outrage and injustice, nearly extinguished, erupted again. From that meeting at the hotel, Dave Sharrett Sr. began his own quest, one that has yet to end.
For the elder Sharrett, the first knock on the door came Jan. 16, 2008, while he was teaching English at Chantilly High School, where he had transferred after 17 years at Langley. A family friend stood outside the classroom.
"Vicki needs you to come home," the friend said.
It was appropriate that he would get the word about his son while teaching, because his son had grown up inside the classrooms of Langley High. The elder Sharrett and his first wife split up not long after Dave II was born, and Sharrett assumed full custody as a single parent. When day care fell through, little Dave spent the day in his father's English classes at Langley, where many teenagers over the years came to know him as "Bean."
Dave Sharrett Sr. had a devoted following at Langley, where he'd been a star football player and sprinter in the early 1970s, before playing college football at Colorado State University. Ruggedly handsome, with long flowing hair, he was also a guitarist who loved classic rock-and-roll. As a teacher, his charisma and fluency in both Shakespeare and Dylan endeared him to students, many of whom stayed in touch long after they had left Langley and Chantilly. Now retired from teaching, he has a large Facebook following.
There were solemn knocks at other doors that same morning. In Forest, Ill., outside Champaign, Doug Kimme received one. In Waterville, N.Y., so did Jim and Susan Sigsbee. Three American soldiers gone. Three families forever devastated. No details of their deaths were immediately available.
Jan. 16, 2008
The surge was on in Iraq. President George W. Bush had resolved that an infusion of U.S. forces would lead to an end of the sectarian strife. Pfc. Dave Sharrett II was an infantryman, part of the 101st Airborne Division, which was shipped into Baladin September 2007.
In the Bichigan region north of Baghdad, the Army discovered that members of the group al-Qaeda in Iraq were equipping suicide bombers and terrorizing residents. As part of Operation Hood Harvest, Sharrett's seven-man Team 6, headed by Staff Sgt. Chris McGraw, boards two Black Hawk helicopters and prepares to hunt down and arrest, or kill if necessary, any suspected terrorists spotted after curfew. For Hood Harvest, Team 6 was joined by an eighth man, the company's executive officer, 1st Lt. Timothy Hanson, who would handle communications with the air power overhead.
Shortly before 5 a.m., the overhead observers spot movement: six men, apparently unarmed, running single file into a palm grove and then across an open field. The helicopters and drone, beaming live images to the operations center, watch as the six men climb inside an oval-shaped thicket of branches and vines.
Nine days after the Sharretts learned their son was dead, they were preparing for his funeral at Arlington National Cemetery. And there was a second knock on the door.
It was the Sharretts' casualty assistance officer, Master Sgt. James Blake.
"He told us it was possibly friendly fire, but he didn't have any details," Dave Sharrett Sr. recalled.
An internal investigation, called anAR 15-6, is standard anytime a soldier is killed. In fact, one had already been completed on the incident, finding no fault with any of the soldiers' actions. But after a NATO 5.56mm bullet was pulled from Dave Sharrett II's body, Maj. Gen. Mark Hertlingordered a second AR 15-6.
Dave Sharrett Sr. was unfamiliar with any of this. He hadn't served a day in the military and knew nothing of its procedures. He was preparing for his son's burial in three days, trying to write the eulogy. Blake's tentative suggestion of friendly fire merely added to the confusion. Sharrett asked whether he could speak to someone directly in Iraq, maybe one of his son's commanders.
That night, Dave Sharrett Sr. received a call from Lt. Col. Robert McCarthy, the leader of Operation Hood Harvest. Sharrett asked him about the report that his son had been killed by one of his own men. "That's not true!" Sharrett recalled McCarthy yelling through the phone, so loudly he held it away from his ear. That was good enough for Sharrett.
McCarthy is vehement that he never denied the friendly fire. He told investigators that he only denied that Dave Sharrett II was killed by helicopter fire, as commanders initially feared. Dave Sharrett Sr. said he never knew, or asked, anything about helicopters.
McCarthy declined to comment.
In central Illinois, Doug Kimme couldn't quite understand why his son was killed. As a former Air Force paratrooper, and now a police officer and weapons trainer with the Champaign Police Department, he had trained his son to be a smart soldier and a precise shooter.
As a veteran cop, he began to investigate. He reached out to other members of Team 6, and to Dave Sharrett Sr.
In comparing notes, they found one striking similarity: Both soldiers had said virtually the same words shortly before they died: "Dad, we're doing too much stupid stuff. I want out of the infantry."
5:07 a.m.
Team 6 climbs out of the helicopter, about 200 meters from the thicket containing six "unknown enemies," or UEs. It is pitch-black - no moon, no stars, no ambient light at all. Each of the eight soldiers is wearing a night-vision goggle over one eye, with the other eye clear to help with depth of field.
To reduce confusion, the soldiers are equipped with infrared lights, called "bud lights," flashing strobes visible only through the night vision goggles or infrared cameras. But in their haste, Hanson and McGraw forget to tell their team to assemble the lights and turn them on.
Sharrett doesn't put his light on.
5:08 a.m.: The six UEs in the thicket quickly arm themselves with AK-47 rifles from a hidden underground cache, then lie down and remain still.
5:15 a.m.: Overhead video shows the eight soldiers casually walk up to the thicket, four on one side and four on the other, forming an armed circle.
5:16 a.m.: Sharrett and Spec. Raphael Collins, on the north end of the thicket, step toward the bush. Collins yells in English for those in the bush to show their hands and come out. No answer. Collins leans his head in and sees two eyes staring back at him.
Collins raises his gun to fire. "Allahu akbar!" someone yells. Collins snaps off one round as another shot comes right at him, pierces his shoulder and knocks him backward. Gunfire erupts from the enemy thicket in all directions. Chaos.
In May 2008, Dave and Vicki Sharrett received another visit from their casualty assistance officer, Master Sgt. Blake. He carried the findings of the second AR 15-6 investigationand a PowerPoint presentation. The Sharretts were simply blown away.
The last they'd heard, it wasn't friendly fire. But here was Blake going over the 15-6 with them. The report concluded that Team 6 had wrongly encircled the bush, that five of the eight soldiers - including Sharrett - hadn't activated their infrared strobe lights and that Sharrett "was killed by friendly fire when he moved toward the lieutenant's position and was misidentified as an enemy fleeing the thicket."
In essence, the Sharretts felt, the report blamed Dave Sharrett II for his own death because he hadn't activated his infrared light.
Hanson's name, and the names of everyone who survived the firefight, were redacted and remain redacted in every report to this day, under Army privacy rules. One sentence in the report by Maj. Rob Young stated that the lieutenant "accompanied the medevac aircraft to the combat support hospital . . . leaving no leader . . . on the ground to assist with accountability of Soldiers."
But Young did not note that the unnamed lieutenant never mentioned to anyone that he had shot Sharrett.
The report also did not point out that the lieutenant never helped anyone locate Sharrett while he lay bleeding for 75 minutes from a gunshot wound, which entered his left buttock and severed his femoral artery. The 15-6 also made no mention that there were video recordings of the firefight. And it determined that the lieutenant had "misidentified" Sharrett as the enemy, though the lieutenant's two sworn statements make no mention that he'd even fired at anyone, much less misidentified them.
"I did not find any violations of the law, regulations, or policies during this investigation," Young concluded.
Blake appeared stunned, Dave Sharrett Sr. recalled. He said Blake "shook his head and said, 'Man, there's something wrong here,' " referring to Hanson's departure from the battlefield. " 'Never ever would anybody do that.' "
It appeared no one was being held accountable. Blake's candid reaction to the report raised red flags for the Sharretts.
In addition to Hanson's unexplained leaving of the battlefield, the Sharretts now learned that their son had lain on the frozen ground for more than an hour after being shot and was still alive when he was found. Grief was slowly being replaced by outrage.
5:16 a.m.
"Shots fired! Shots fired! Troops in contact!" Hanson yells into his radio as he darts away from the bush and hits the ground. Cpl. John Sigsbee, standing on the west side of the thicket, is shot and mortally wounded. Pfc. Danny Kimme begins to get down into the prone position and is fatally shot in the head.
Sharrett sprints around the west side of the thicket and dives to the ground next to Sigsbee. Sharrett is quiet and still, perhaps four feet from the enemies, who are firing automatic rounds from AK-47 rifles.
5:20 a.m.: Sharrett stands and runs south toward Hanson. Sharrett fires a blast back over his left shoulder at a man in the thicket, apparently hitting him.
Within five seconds, another soldier runs east. It is Hanson. And as the helicopters continue to circle, Sharrett comes back into view, writhing on the ground, just a few yards from where Hanson had just been.
In the fall of 2008, Sharrett went to McCarthy's supervisor in the 101st Airborne, Col. Scott McBride.
McBride offered his condolences and, in response to the complaints of Sharrett and Kimme, wrote a letter of reprimand for Hanson in October 2008. "Without us, [Hanson] would have skated," Sharrett said.
McBride sent a copy of the letter to Sharrett. "Based on your actions," McBride wrote to Hanson, "I have grave doubts concerning your potential for future military service."
But the reprimand was placed in Hanson's local file, rather than his permanent file, meaning it would be destroyed when the 101st left Iraq, which was in a few weeks.
Again, the Sharretts were angry. There would be no trace of this incident on Hanson's record. He would be promoted to captain, and probably higher. Sharrett contacted McBride, who agreed to meet with the Sharrett family when the 101st returned stateside.
In January 2009, McBride drove to the Sharretts' new home in Forest, Va., outside Lynchburg, where Dave Sharrett Sr. had been planning to retire before his son's death. Also present for the meeting were Sharrett's wife, Vicki; their two teenage sons, Chris and Brooks; and Sharrett's two brothers, a Presbyterian minister and a circuit court judge.
The family pressed McBride for answers, and he was open with them.
"We underestimated the enemy," McBride told them, according to Sharrett's telling. "We made tactical mistakes."
Chris Sharrett, then 19, asked, "What are you going to do to the man who shot my brother?"
McBride responded, "That's a good question."
Judge Allan W. Sharrett told McBride, according to his brother's notes, "If there's no reprimand, historically there's no accountability and the whole thing stands as an example of what you can get away with."
McBride agreed. He told the Sharretts he would write a permanent reprimand for Hanson, which would prevent his promotion and stall his Army career. And in February 2009, he wrote the letter.
McBride did not tell the Sharretts that, after the incident, he had immediately obtained videos of the shooting and then pulled Hanson out of active combat and "brought him up to the staff," he said in a recent interview.
At first, McBride said, he felt sorry for Hanson. He carried the guilt of having killed one of his own men.
"Then I spent some time with him," McBride said. "After talking to him, I got the sense he was weak. Just his demeanor, his decisions. Having spent time with him, and then looked Mr. and Mrs. Sharrett in the eye, and meeting his two brothers, and knowing Dave Sharrett doesn't have closure," he decided to seek a formal reprimand of Hanson.
Dave Sharrett Sr. said that after McBride left their house, there was a sense of muted optimism in the family. "For the first time it seemed that we had turned a corner in our search for truth," he said.
He and his wife reversed themselves and decided to attend a memorial service for the three fallen soldiers at Fort Campbell in February 2009, to meet Doug Kimme and the Sigsbees for the first time.
6:03 a.m.
A team of snipers and other soldiers, Team 4, arrives to help Team 6, led by Lt. Tim Cunningham. His radio operator, Spec. Jerwien Fuentes, and Cunningham encounter Hanson first. Fuentes later said, "His exact words still make me so angry. He said, 'We're getting shot at, and I don't know where any of my guys are.' "
Cunningham, who was killed in action three months later, said in his sworn statement soon after the incident that Hanson and his fellow Team 6 members "pointed us to the enemy bush, and told us that they did not know where Kimme, Sigsbee or Sharrett were."
Cunningham patiently lines up his team for an assault on the thicket, then methodically moves in on it, discovering the bodies of Sigsbee and Kimme on their approach. But it's still dark, and they do not see Sharrett.
At Fort Campbell in February 2009, Dave and Vicki Sharrett met Doug Kimme in person for the first time, and Jim and Susan Sigsbee. The Sharretts also met Lt. Col. McCarthy for the first time, had lunch with him and said he wept as he recalled the day their son died.
McCarthy also assured them that their son hadn't been found more quickly because he had moved outside the view of the live video feed from a drone being monitored back at the operations center. They had heard that explanation before and accepted it.
That night, after the memorial service, the Sharretts went back to Doug Kimme's room at the Holiday Inn Express. The parents shared a bottle of Scotch, and their pain, before the soldiers from the 101st arrived.
They were carrying portable hard drives, used in Iraq to avoid widespread computer viruses. On the drives, they said, were video recordings shot by a drone and an F-16 jet.
"They said the Army was covering up," Sharrett recalled.
The soldiers kept saying, "You've got to see these, you've got to see these," the Sharretts recalled. But in the small hotel room, no one could get the videos to play.
The Sharretts had sat with McCarthy that day, and he told them their son had crawled out of the cameras' range. But the soldiers said that wasn't true. The drone video, remote-controlled by someone back at base, shows everyone involved in solid black forms and could have been used to locate the wounded soldier, Sharrett said.
While the soldiers tinkered with laptop computers, Sharrett ducked into the hotel bathroom and called one of his former students, a New York Daily News reporter named James Gordon Meek, back in Arlington.
"We've been [expletive] lied to!" he yelled into his cellphone. "We've been here with these soldiers, and they're telling us about a cover-up."
The Army was still dealing with its mishandling of the friendly-fire death of former professional football player Pat Tillman, whose fatal shooting by fellow Army Rangers in Afghanistan was initially covered up and became the subject of high-profile investigations. Since 2001, about 55 American soldiers have been killed by friendly fire, according to a military spokesman.
Kimme and Meek soon obtained the drone and F-16 videos from different sources and could see the tragic drama unfold for the first time. Kimme watched the death of his son.
Neither video showed the exact moment when Sharrett was shot. But in the drone video he can be seen standing up, firing back into the thicket and heading toward Hanson. The camera then panned away, and when it returned, Sharrett was down, and Hanson had moved about 30 yards away.
Several weeks later, Kimme heard from some soldiers in the 101st again. Timothy Hanson had been promoted to captain. McBride's request to discipline him had been rejected by a new general at Fort Campbell.
6:04 a.m.
Black Hawk pilot Lyndle Ratliff, low on fuel and hurt by flying glass from enemy bullets, lands north of the thicket and picks up the wounded McGraw and Collins. Hanson, not wounded, also gets on the helicopter.
6:05 a.m.: The Black Hawk lifts off. Ratliff lands at the combat support hospital in Balad a little later, and McGraw and Collins climb off the helicopter without assistance from Hanson, according to their statements. In his statement, Ratliff wrote, "One of the three on board (LT) was apparently either not wounded or refused treatment, because he refused to get off of the aircraft."
Ratliff flies to a refueling station and then back to Camp Paliwoda. Hanson goes inside but does not brief command staff.
The new commander at Fort Campbell, Brig. Gen. Steven Townsend, told Dave Sharrett Sr. that he would review McBride's request to discipline Hanson with an open mind. In an interview, Townsend said he spoke with McBride and asked him what would justify reopening the case.
Ultimately, Townsend said, "I was not willing to overrule all the commanders in the field based on the information I had at that time." Townsend had not been with the 101st Airborne at the time of the incident. In an e-mail to his supervisors, Townsend wrote that after being given a local reprimand and living with the "the heavy burden that his personal mistakes contributed to the deaths of his men," Hanson "served the rest of his tour honorably. He has continued to serve well since this incident and was recently promoted to Captain by the Army."
Once again, the Sharretts were floored.
Though Meek had advised the Sharretts for a year not to go public, he and Dave Sharrett now agreed that an article was warranted. Meek sent a list of questions to Townsend and lined up an interview at Fort Campbell with McCarthy.
According to a transcript, Meek asked McCarthy about Hanson's failure to seek any help for Sharrett or tell anyone that Sharrett was wounded, noting that Hanson's helicopter left for the hospital 45 minutes before Sharrett was placed on a medevac helicopter. That difference might have saved Sharrett's life, Meek said.
"Yes," McCarthy said.
"Why didn't you reprimand him for leaving the field of battle with unaccounted-for men?" Meek asked.
"I don't think he deliberately left it," McCarthy answered, explaining that the helicopter was ordered to take off while in a hot battle zone.
Several months earlier, Kimme had asked McCarthy the same question about Hanson. He said McCarthy responded: "Why should I ruin another life? He didn't do it intentionally."
The headline in the Daily Newson April 1, 2009, blared, "Army lied, sez slain G.I.'s dad."
But the Army shrugged off the brief burst of publicity and took no action.
6:10 a.m.
Team 4 determines that all six enemy fighters in the thicket are dead. They begin searching for Sharrett but can't find him.
6:35 a.m. Someone shoots flares into the sky to illuminate the area, Fuentes said, and Sharrett is finally spotted. He has a faint pulse. Fuentes begins doing CPR, taking turns with another soldier.
"Cunningham says, 'Keep him alive guys, keep him alive.' We were near exhaustion just trying to keep this guy alive" while wearing heavy combat gear, Fuentes said. Capt. Michael Loveall, Hanson's supervisor, lands and watches the rescue effort, then asks for Hanson. No one knows where he is. Loveall tries to raise the lieutenant on the radio but fails.
6:50 a.m.: A medevac helicopter lands. Sharrett is loaded aboard and flown to a hospital.
7:50 a.m.: Pfc. David H. Sharrett II is pronounced dead upon his arrival at Camp Paliwoda.
In December 2009, Dave Sharrett Sr. was still seething. They now had video, which had been monitored live in the Iraq command center, showing that his son had lain on the ground for 75 minutes before being found - and 25 minutes after the battle ended - while plainly visible through the drone. The soldier who shot Dave Sharrett II had not given any explanation for his actions, which appeared on the video to include turning at least 45 degrees to his left, shooting Sharrett at close range, and then standing and running in the opposite direction.
Meanwhile, Meek had a chance encounter with President Obama at Dave Sharrett II's grave at Arlington Cemetery on Veterans Day and wrote a widely read articlethat mentioned Sharrett and the friendly fire. Encouraged, Dave Sharrett Sr. wrote a detailed, emotional letter to the Army chief of staff, Gen. George W. Casey Jr., in hopes of shaking loose some interest.
"The pain we live with will never subside," Sharrett wrote. "It may lessen in time - if the whole truth is laid bare . . . Still, more can, and should, be done, sir."
Casey responded by assigningCol. David Bishop to do a "senior level review." Bishop re-read the statements and AR 15-6 reports. He also obtained two new Apache helicopter videos, with audio from the pilots, Hanson and his commanders. The recordings clearly showed Dave Sharrett II running toward Hanson, then Hanson almost immediately running in the opposite direction, and then later climbing onto a Black Hawk helicopter and leaving.
Bishop summoned the Sharretts and Kimme to the Pentagon for a briefing in August 2010. He showed them the new Apache video and handed them a report finding no real fault with the investigations. And he told them he had spoken with Hanson the day before. He asked Hanson why he left the battle, and Hanson told him he needed to assist his wounded men, then get back to headquarters and brief his commanders.
But the meeting grew testy as Bishop discussed the Army's assertion that the wounded Dave Sharrett II couldn't be located by the video cameras. The elder Sharrett watched the new Apache video, as well as the drone video, showing his son clearly on the screen.
"I can see my son!" Dave Sharrett Sr. yelled. "He's right there!"
Lt. Gen. William J. Troy had just been promoted to director of the Army staff, one of the military's top posts, and sat in on the meeting. He seemed openly troubled, Sharrett said.
In the fall of 2010, Sharrett finally got the autopsy report on his son. The angle and size of the wound indicated a nearly point-blank shot.
In February 2011, Troy ordered a third AR 15-6, to be conducted by Bishop, now a general.
Jan. 19
The members of Team 6 are told to write statements about what happened. Hanson writes that when the shooting started, he went to the ground, fired six to 10 shots at the thicket, and then saw Sharrett and Sigsbee "lying face down no more than 10 feet from the enemy position," not moving. "At one point in time the enemy began to fire again in all directions and either Pfc. Sharrett or Spc.[sic] Sigsbee yelled in pain and said I'm hit. I could not get close enough to the two soldiers to provide aid and I could hear two enemy personnel talking to each other, so I decided to break contact across the ditch."
Hanson does not mention firing his weapon again after his initial burst. And though he initially told Cunningham and Fuentes that he didn't know where his men were, he draws a detailed diagram of their whereabouts to accompany his statement.
Jan. 25: Hanson writes a second statement, answering specific questions about tactics and the enemy but again does not mention shooting anyone. Soon after, forensics tests establish that Hanson's rifle fired the shot that killed Sharrett.
For his new investigation, Bishop traveled the world, doing face-to-face or phone interviews with all of the participants. Twice he sat down with Hanson, the second time reading him his Miranda rights against self-incrimination.
And then he went through the new Apache video with the captain, now stationed in Wisconsin, transcripts show. Showing Hanson the key moments as Sharrett ran toward him, Bishop asked Hanson, "Can you explain to me what might have happened that caused him to be shot in the left buttocks without you knowing it?"
"No idea."
"Were you engaging the bush?" Bishop asked.
"No idea, sir," Hanson replied again.
Showing the tape again, Bishop asked, "You never saw him?"
"I did not, sir."
Bishop continued, "In order to engage him in the left buttocks, what kind of change to your weapon orientation would you have had to made?"
"In order to shoot him, I would have had to shoot to the left," Hanson said.
"Do you recall shooting to your left?" Bishop asked.
"No, sir," Hanson replied. "I thought I was shooting directly at the bush." Hanson also said that he did not hear Sharrett cry out or fall.
"At no time did you ever think that you may have shot someone?" Bishop asked.
"No," Hanson answered.
Bishop wrote a 29-page report, which was released to the Sharretts and Kimme in late August. For the first time, the Army forcefully criticized Hanson, but the recommended discipline was redacted under Army personnel privacy rules.
Bishop noted that there was no evidence to support the Army's initial assertion that Hanson mistook Sharrett for the enemy, because Hanson repeatedly denied ever identifying or engaging anyone. Bishop said the video and physical evidence "suggests that Pfc. Sharrett may have been within six feet of Hanson around the time he was shot."
Bishop concluded that Hanson "failed to perform basic tasks expected of all infantry officers . . . [which] resulted in the engagement that ended with three U.S. soldiers killed, one from fratricide . . . he abdicated his duty when he left his unit for no compelling reason with four of his Soldiers unaccounted for and without conducting an adequate battle handover . . .
"Hanson's multiple failures to meet expectations immediately following the engagement reflect serious personal judgment errors in leadership and I recommend that Hanson be held accountable for his actions." The actual action taken against Hanson was not made public, but Hertling said recently that Hanson was no longer in the Army.
Reached at his home in Wisconsin, Hanson declined to be interviewed. But he did make his first public comment on the case when he said, "I've always wanted to apologize to the Sharretts. Eventually, I'd like to do it in person. I do want to say I'm sorry."
Bishop also addressed the lack of discipline accorded Hanson in the previous years of review.
Asked why he didn't reach the same conclusions as Bishop, Hertling said he wasn't focused on Hanson's actions after the firefight: "I was concerned about was there a fratricide, why did it happen, what do we do to prevent it from happening again."
McBride, now retired, said: "I think we did two incomplete investigations that didn't address the entirety of the operation. It focused on the firefight. And it took a father's will to push the leadership to make it happen. It's been all about his will."
Dave Sharrett Sr. and Doug Kimme remain unsatisfied. They want to know what action, exactly, Bishop recommended for Hanson and whether it was imposed. They wonder why none of Hanson's commanders were reprimanded, though Bishop criticized some of the commanders' preparation of the soldiers.
In December, Sharrett wrote a letter to Secretary of the Army John McHugh asking why Hanson wasn't court-martialed for abandoning his men or charged for his contradictory statements about his actions. He wanted to know why Hertling and his then-boss, Gen. Lloyd Austin, "did not have any apparent curiosity" about Hanson's "inexcusable abandonment of his men."
Bishop declined to be interviewed. Army spokesman George Wright said the Army had done a "formal and detailed investigation. We recognize that Pfc. Sharrett's family views events and draws conclusions differently than that of investigators and commanders. We stand by our investigation and decisions that affected individuals involved in this incident."
Sharrett's letter noted that McHugh, in October, published his top priorities for the Army. In it, McHugh wrote, "Accountability in word and deed is at the very core of what it means to be an Army leader. "
And mindful of that, Sharrett told McHugh about his dream of seeing his son, of saying to him, " 'I know how you get killed.' In that moment, the great dilemma of changing time and outcomes flashes before me," Sharrett wrote. "He looks at me, listening to me breaking like a twig, and we both understand the great question facing us: Does he go back?
"Likewise, do we go back? Should we look back? Does it matter how one soldier died in that long sad roll call? Out of all the thousands, does it make any difference that the 3,925th American who fell in Iraqshould not have perished from this Earth?"

Deaths muddy U.S exit strategy

BYLINE: Greg Jaffe

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A01

LENGTH: 1027 words

In the course of one week, the burning of copies of the Koran by U.S. military personnel in Afghanistan has set off a deadly chain of events that has not only inflamed tensions but possibly exposed a crippling weakness in the American strategy to wind down the war.
The emerging U.S. strategy in Afghanistan is built around plans to replace large NATO combat formations with small teams of advisers who will live and work alongside their Afghan partners.  
But the killing of two high-ranking NATO officers by an Afghan security official - and the subsequent decision by the top NATO commander in the country to recall his personnel from top Afghan ministries - has spurred doubts about whether Afghan security forces can be relied upon to provide for the protection of their Western partners. The consequences of that erosion of confidence, former U.S. officials and analysts say, could be devastating.
"If the trust, ability and willingness to partner falls apart, you are looking at the endgame here," said Mark Jacobson, who served until last summer as the NATO deputy senior civilian representative in Kabul.
The killing of the U.S. officers on Saturday occurred two days after a man wearing an Afghan army uniform fatally shot two American troops in eastern Afghanistan, the latest in a string of incidents in recent months in which local security forces have turned against NATO personnel. 
Some of the killings have been perpetrated by Afghan troops whose loyalties lay with the Taliban. But, in most cases, the attacks have been the result of tensions between U.S. forces and Afghans who felt as though they had suffered an insult to themselves or their faith. 
On Sunday, Afghan President Hamid Karzai, who initially responded to the Koran burnings with outrage, sought to stem the latest wave of violence by issuing a plea for calm and blessing the withdrawal of NATO advisers from his ministries as a justifiable measure. 
But protests continued, including in the northern city of Kunduz, where Afghan demonstrators opened fire and tossed a grenade at a U.S. base, wounding seven American troops. The Afghan defense and interior ministers canceled a long-planned trip to Washington to focus on curbing the violence, which has claimed 25 Afghan lives.
"We remain committed to a partnership with the Afghan government and people," the U.S. ambassador to Kabul, Ryan C. Crocker, told CNN on Sunday, promising that American service members and civilians would continue to work with their Afghan allies.
For now, though, much of the cooperation between U.S. advisers and their Afghan partners is on hold. And even though the decision to withdraw the advisers is probably temporary, it is not clear how U.S. troops will be able to reestablish trust with Afghan security forces.
"This is not going back to business as usual," an Army officer who works as an adviser in Kabul said Sunday. "The threat is still higher than normal." 
Once advisers return to the ministries, the officer said, some will probably have to shorten their visits, instead of remaining there for six-to-10-hour shifts, to reduce risks.
Senior Obama administration officials have sought to reassure a war-weary American public that the NATO combat mission in Afghanistan would draw to a close by the middle of next year. These officials have implied that the change to an advisory mission would not only mean fewer U.S. service members in Afghanistan, but also less risk for the noncombat troops who remain behind.
Military experts, however, say that the smaller U.S. advisory force might be more exposed to fratricidal attacks than conventional military units. Such attacks - which were exceptionally rare in Iraq - often stem from a cultural chasm between U.S. and Afghan troops. 
Carter Malkasian, who served as a State Department adviser in southern Afghanistan's Helmand province in 2010 and 2011, said one way to mitigate that risk is for advisers to build closer relationships with their Afghan partners. But the risk will always be there. 
"The most effective advisers will be with their Afghans all the time, and that certainly does involve additional risk," Malkasian said. 
Unlike a typical infantry platoon, which consists of more than 35 heavily armed soldiers, the advisers work in teams of as few as a dozen troops. Some military and civilian advisers working in Afghanistan said Sunday that the risks associated with their jobs were still manageable and that they believed that they would soon be able to return to their work.
"I hope [the ban] is lifted soon," said a State Department adviser working at a remote outpost in eastern Afghanistan. "Maybe I am complacent. I know we face all kinds of threats, but we have a job to do."
Current plans call for the U.S. force in Afghanistan to fall from a peak of 100,000 troops to about 68,000 by the end of the summer. Further reductions are likely later this year and in 2013. All NATO combat troops are expected to be withdrawn by the end of 2014.
In an article in the upcoming issue of Foreign Affairs, Malkasian and Kael Weston, who served a multiyear stint as an adviser in southern Afghanistan, estimated that NATO could hold off the Taliban and keep the Afghan government and security forces functioning with as few as 25,000 advisory troops. 
The Afghans would rely on the NATO advisers to call in airstrikes if their position was about to be overrun by a larger Taliban force. The advisers would ensure that their Afghan partner units were receiving ammunition, food and fuel from their headquarters. The Westerners also would help control the most damaging and overt acts of corruption.
To be effective, these troops would have to live without large American bases, expensive dining facilities and intensive quick-reaction forces. 
"The more willing advisers are to accept risk," Malkasian said, "the more effective they will be."

Executives turn to body language for an edge

BYLINE: Abha Bhattarai

SECTION: Pg. A16

LENGTH: 667 words

Janine Driver has a few tips for you: Touch your chin the next time you're accepting a stressful assignment. Widen your stance when you're in an important business meeting. And the next time you're sitting down, pop one elbow over the top of your chair.
"How you sit, stand, walk, shake hands - it's all part of your brand," said Driver, chief executive of the Body Language Institute in Alexandria. "Powerful people, they do it a certain way. They take up space, they exude confidence, they know how to show they're smart and in control." 
Driver, whose clients include Lockheed Martin, Coca-Cola and Georgetown University, said business leaders are learning not only how to send the right signals, but also how to read them. In light of high-profile cases of fraud in recent years, deception detection techniques and body language workshops that were once reserved for police forces, military intelligence personnel and the FBI are becoming relevant in the corporate world.
"This is something you absolutely didn't see five or 10 years ago," said James Newberry, a former agent for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, who teaches deception detection and rapport building at the Body Language Institute. "But now when managers hire people or negotiate a deal, they're interested in knowing how to read faces and body language."
The Body Language Institute is part of a thriving industry of consultants helping people to climb their career ladder.
In Chevy Chase, Michele Pollard Patrick recently added a "boardroom body language" course to her curriculum at National Protocol, which offers courses in etiquette.
Among other things, she teaches hiring managers that they should sit across from the person they're interviewing, but that the chairs shouldn't be completely in line.
"Direct eye contact is important, but your chair should be slightly off so you're not too intimidating," she said.
When Patrick started the school 20 years ago, she taught dining etiquette to children. "Now," she said, "all of my clients are corporations and law firms and universities."

Teaching detective skills
  Driver, who spent 15 years as a federal law enforcement officer for the Justice Department, started the Body Language Institute three years ago when she realized there was an untapped market for teaching detective skills to businesspeople.
"It's literally the same techniques I've given the CIA and the FBI," said Driver, whose three-day courses cost $1,495. "There is such a demand for these skills in the corporate world."
Over the years, she has assembled a collection of instructors - ranging from those who focus on fraud and deception, to others who specialize in etiquette and handwriting analysis. It is important, she said, for executives to know how to interpret different types of signals their employees and clients may be sending them.
"For example," Driver said, "truthful people say 'no.' If someone were to ask you 'Have you ever stolen money from your boss's wallet?' you'd say 'no.' But a liar would say, 'never.' That's what you have to look for."
Facial reactions and expressions can change within a fraction of a second, making them easy to miss, said Aaron Brehove, a fraud investigator for an accounting firm  , who also teaches at the Body Language Institute.
"In the boardroom, when people aren't completely enthralled with an initiative you're pushing, you need to be able to recognize what's happening," Brehove said. "Being able to read nonverbal and verbal cues can make the difference between being a good manager and not, so a lot of executives are looking for ways to reinvent how they present themselves."
Toby Warden, a study director at the National Research Council in Washington, took a course at the Body Language Institute earlier this year.
"The important thing for me was learning how to not only be open but to appear open at work," she said. "I'm a lot more aware of my interactions now and try to keep my palms open when I talk."

A Santorum barragein the culture wars

BYLINE: Nia-Malika Henderson

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A01

LENGTH: 1102 words

DATELINE: DETROIT

Detroit - Rick Santorum has opened up a new and provocative front in the political culture wars as he boldly tries to cast the race for the White House as a battle between the secular and the religious.
In back-to-back speeches over the weekend, the candidate described President Obama as "a snob" for focusing on the importance of a college education and disparaged the idea of a separation between church and state by attacking President John F. Kennedy, who made it akey point in his 1960 campaign.
Campaigning here Saturday, Santorum said Obama's focus on higher education constitutes "indoctrination" into the president's way of thinking.
"President Obama once said he wants everybody in America to go to college. What a snob," said the former senator from Pennsylvania. "There are good, decent men and women who go out and work hard every day and put their skills to test that aren't taught by some liberal college professor to try to indoctrinate them. Oh, I understand why he wants you to go to college. He wants to remake you in his image." 
Santorum's main argument to conservative Republican voters is that he is the anti-Obama, a cultural warrior for the right who can draw a clear contrast and ignite passion and excitement for the conservative cause in a way that rival Mitt Romney cannot.
Santorum's strident rhetoric comes as his advantages in the polls, both in Michigan and nationally, have shrunk and his argument that he is the only "full-spectrum conservative" in the race has been challenged by Romney and damaged by Santorum's own admission that he backed No Child Left Behind, a George W. Bush administration school reform initiative, even though he didn't believe in it.
Santorum pulled out a narrow, surprise win in Iowa by emphasizing his faith, and in Colorado, Minnesota and Missouri, social conservatives helped deliver a string of victories this month that propelled him to the top of the polls.
After trying to differentiate himself as a blue-collar conservative on economic issues, Santorum appears to be going back to his earlier playbook, mixing faith and politics, while Romney tries to focus the debate of on jobs and the economy.
Polls show that Romney continues to struggle with evangelicals, social conservatives and working-class Republicans and to have trouble connecting with ordinary voters.
The former Massachusetts governor's offhand comment last week that his wife has a "couple of Cadillacs" underscored his inability to connect with the type of blue-collar workers that Santorum is aiming to reach.
Asked Sunday on ABC's "This Week" how his faith fits in with his ideas about governing, Santorum said he disagreed with the "absolute separation" between church and state outlined by Kennedy in a 1960 speech.
Santorum said reading the speech made him want to "throw up."
"I don't believe in an America where the separation of church and state is absolute," he said. "The idea that the church can have no influence or no involvement in the operation of the state is absolutely antithetical to the objectives and vision of our country."
As he did in Iowa, South Carolina and Florida, Santorum continues to campaign in churches, calling on people of faith to see this GOP race as a contest between the secular and the religious. He emphasizes that his worldview is grounded in faith and family.
His large family and the fact that his children are home-schooled have become a touchstone for his candidacy, confirming to social conservatives that he is one of them.
Santorum and his aides insist it is the media that focuses on social issues, but the candidate spent an hour Saturday lecturing to a group of about 1,000 people in a church auditorium in Hixon, Tenn., about the dangers of a feel-good culture.
"True happiness comes from doing God's will," he said as the audience at Central Baptist Church cheered and gave him a nearly minute-long standing ovation. "It comes from not doing what you want to do, but doing what you ought to do."
At a rally Sunday evening in Davison, Mich., that opened with a prayer and gospel hymns, Santorum was introduced as a "man who knows a nation cannot rise without God's aid."
He defended his record as a conservative and said, "Governor Romney, why are you attacking me as not being conservative enough? How dare you say I'm not a fiscal conservative. Ladies and gentlemen, I know what team I'm on. I'm on the conservative team that stands up for the values that make this country great."
Santorum's rallies have consistently drawn protesters who object to his views on gay rights and faith. A protester in Hixon held up a sign saying that America is a democracy, not a theocracy.
On the ground in Michigan, where Romney has hammered Santorum as a big spender who voted five times to increase the debt ceiling and supported expensive, taxpayer-funded earmarks, polls show that support for Santorum among fiscal and social conservatives has been cut in half.
"What Romney's strategy has done is to erase the lead that Santorum had with fiscal conservatives, but by doing that he also cut into the lead Santorum had with social conservatives because there is an overlay," said Steve Mitchell, who is president of Mitchell Research and Communications and conducted four polls in February.
Mitchell said that roughly 50 to 55 percent of voters in the Michigan race identify themselves as evangelicals, and Santorum is working to boost his support among those voters even as his credentials as fiscal conservative have been assailed.
"His campaign in Michigan is made up in a large part of evangelicals," Mitchell said. "That's why he is taking that stand; he is really trying to bring home the social conservatives at the end of the race."
While Romney has cast himself as the conservative businessman, Santorum has positioned himself as the candidate with the common touch, highlighting his blue-collar roots and his Catholic faith - he has often said that he comes from a place where people tote a Bible in one hand and a gun in the other.
And by slamming Obama for being a "snob," Santorum, if only indirectly, also points a finger at Romney's wealth and status as the establishment's candidate.
"He is making an indirect appeal to those voters who might have looked oddly on Mitt Romney's Cadillac comment," said Ron Bonjean, a GOP strategist. "But there is not a cohesive overall national strategy. He is throwing mud on the wall to see if it will stick. And he wants to ratchet up the fiery rhetoric to activate the base and get them out.
"These are short plays because, in the long run, the game is going to be for independents."

Baltimore County Guard officer died in Kabul attack

BYLINE: Susan Svrluga

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B05

LENGTH: 661 words

Before Maj. Robert Marchanti II was deployed by the Maryland Army National Guard, when he was teaching at a Baltimore County elementary school, students and teachers made a photo book for him. When he walked into the room the last morning, all the kindergartners saluted. "He was a big, burly, big tough guy, and he just turned into a marshmallow," said Carney Elementary School teacher Beth Avil. "Tears came into his eyes, and he sat in one of the little kindergarten chairs to look through the book."
Marchanti was a strong man, family and friends said, physically tough at 48, disciplined, committed to his family, his Christian faith, his country. And he was a softie. "He just gave his whole heart to everyone," his daughter, Leah Marchanti, 20, said. "He loved sentimental things . . . like dancing with me. We always talked about the song we would choose when I walked down the wedding aisle." 
Her father died Saturday, one of two U.S. officers shot and killed at the Afghan Interior Ministry in Kabul, the Maryland National Guard confirmed Monday.
It was a death that had international impact. The United States, France, Britain and NATO pulled their personnel out of the Afghan ministries after the shooting. Along with the days of violent rioting that began after NATO said its troops inadvertently burned copiesof the Koran, the attack has raised doubts about U.S. strategy in Afghanistan.
Closer to home, Marchanti will be remembered for the kind of impact that's harder to see. He would have said he was just ordinary, doing what he was supposed to do, going to work, taking care of his wife, his daughter, his three sons and grandson, Leah Marchanti said. "But I felt like it was extraordinary. . . . You don't see fathers taking care of families like he took care of ours."
 When he came in the door, he would always run over to his wife, Peggy, "giving her a huge disgusting kiss, putting his arms all over her . . . wanting to love up on her all the time," his daughter said. "She acted like it was too much, but she loved it."
He met his wife when they were in high school, working at a Friendly's restaurant. She was scooping ice cream cones, and he was a cook. He took her to his senior prom, and they had been together ever since, their daughter said.
Marchanti joined the Army in 1984, then taught physical education and served in the National Guard for many years before going full-time with the Guard in 2008.
"He was a man who brought a warmth and calmness to any room he walked into," said Melissa Warminski, a first-grade teacher at Carney. "If he put his hand on your shoulder or just looked at you and smiled, you knew everything was going to be fine. That's the kind of guy he was."
Marchanti always had that mix, with his imposing, military bearing but a sweet and loving attitude with the children, she said. One day the teachers were gathered for a group photo and the photographer kept trying to get them to stop chatting and line up. Marchanti suddenly barked, "Fall in!" Everyone snapped to attention, Warminski said, laughing.
"He was such a big guy, then as soon as you talked to him you knew he had a very warm heart," said Bill Adey, another teacher. "Just like a teddy bear."
Marchanti had a goofy side, embarrassing his children, hollering at Ravens games, pulling the car over suddenly to fish because he liked the looks of a pond they were passing by. He made his students laugh by putting on a 10-gallon hat and showing them how to square dance. He always cooked a big spaghetti dinner on Sunday nights for the family.
Warminski said she would remember Marchanti poking his head in the classroom door and offering to help by taking a child out of class for one-on-one tutoring. "Everyone would raise their hands - 'Let me go! Let me go!'ג[#x20ac][#x160]"
This weekend, two soldiers came to his house in Baltimore to notify the family of his death. "Now he's everyone's hero, not just mine," his daughter said, "not just ours."

64 men found dead in Syria

BYLINE: Liz Sly

DATELINE: BEIRUT

BEIRUT - The bodies of dozens of men were found dumped on wasteland on the outskirts of the stricken city of Homs on Monday in what appeared to be one of the worst instances of mass killing since the uprising against President Bashar al-Assadbegan last March.
The Local Coordination Committees, an opposition group, said that the bodies of 64 men were taken to the National Hospital in Homs and that an unknown number of women and children who had been with them are missing. Activists said they thought that the men had been trying to flee the violence with their families when they were stopped and gunned down by security forces.
The details available were murky, however, and the bodies had not been identified, making it difficult to establish exactly how or why the men died.
The discovery came as Syria's state media announced that a big majority of Syrians had voted to approve a new constitutionthat would allow Assad to remain in power until 2028. U.S. and European leaders have condemned the exercise as meaningless, since it seemed designed primarily to ensure Assad's survival rather than to implement genuine reforms. 
The apparent mass killing in Homs spoke to the rising ferocity of the violence engulfing many parts of Syria as the government seeks to quell the revolt and the once-peaceful protest movement increasingly resorts to arms to resist the onslaught, stirring fears of a civil war that could ignite a wider regional conflict.
The deaths were among 124 reported across Syria on Monday as the government's efforts to crush the nearly year-long uprising showed no sign of letting up.
They included an additional 25 victims of continued shelling of the Bab Amr neighborhood in Homs, which has been subjected to daily bombardments by tank and artillery fire in a massive offensive that began Feb. 3.
The assault is aimed at crushing anti-government resistance in what had emerged as one of the biggest strongholds of the loosely organized Free Syrian Army rebel movement.
The official news agency SANA reported the funerals on Monday of 16 soldiers and policemen killed in the violence nationwide.
Homs has also become a flash point for sectarian tensions, which have escalatedas the regime, dominated by members of Assad's minority Alawite sect, has sustained its efforts to quell a revolt embraced by the country's mostly Sunni majority. There have been recent instances of sectarian killings in the city, and some activists said they could not rule out a sectarian dimension to this apparent massacre.

Trying to flee
Activists contacted in Homs said they thought the men were killed mainly because they were originally from Bab Amr. Fighting had displaced them weeks ago to outlying areas of the city, which they sought to flee overnight Sunday when those areas came under heavy attack.
Abu Emad, who spoke from Homs via Skype, said the men were among a large group of families that were leaving those areas when their vehicles were stopped at a checkpoint close to the main highway leading to Damascus.
The families were herded onto four buses, he said, citing the accounts of survivors, and were told they were being taken to a safe place. After a short distance, the elderly passengers were ordered off the buses, and the rest were driven away. On Monday morning, local residents discovered the bodies of the men; the whereabouts of the women and children who were with them are unknown, Emad said.
"They killed all the young men," he said. "Maybe there are more - we still don't know."
The human rights group Avaaz gave a similar account of the incident but put the number of bodies found at 62. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 68 bodies had been taken to the National Hospital. Some of the victims had been shot, and others were bayonetted to death, said the Observatory's spokesman, Rami Abdulrahman. He said it was not clear who the men were or why they were killed.
The accounts could not be independently confirmed; nor could the reports of killings elsewhere in the country, because journalists are not being granted visas to work in Syria.
Among those trapped in besieged Bab Amr are two foreign journalists who had entered the country illegally and were injured last week in a rocket attack that killed American journalist Marie Colvin, who was working for the British Sunday Times, and French photographer Remi Ochlik.
According to the Associated Press, Poland's Foreign Ministry has started an effort to negotiate safe passage out of the area for the two injured journalists, Edith Bouvier of the French newspaper Le Figaro and British photographer Paul Conroy of the Sunday Times, as well as the bodies of the two who were killed. Poland undertook to represent U.S. interests in Syria afterthe closure of the U.S. Embassyin Damascus this month.

A new constitution
SANA reported that 89.4 percent of voters in Sunday's referendum endorsed the constitution, which was unveiled less than two weeks before the balloting amid Russian pressure on Assad to head off escalating Western efforts to force his departure.
The interior minister, Mohammad Ibrahim al-Shaar, was quoted as saying that 8,376,447 citizens, or 57.4 percent of eligible voters, voted in the referendum.The turnout was "good," Shaar said, "despite the threats and intimidation by armed terrorist groups in some areas and the accompanying distortion and instigation campaigns by media."
But with foreign journalists and outside observers barred from witnessing the polling, the opposition boycotting and violence raging across many parts of the country, the validity of the vote or the result was impossible to verify.
Though the new constitution introduces term limits and allows multiple political parties to compete in elections, it concentrates so much power in the presidency that Assad would effectively be able to remain in office 16 more years.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov nonetheless hailed the outcome as a "movement toward democracy," and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin reiterated his opposition to any military intervention in Syria.
"I strongly hope that the United States and other nations will learn from the sad experience and won't try to resort to a forceful scenario in Syria," Putin wrote in a foreign policy manifesto published in Russian newspapers.
The comments followed an effort on Friday to rally support for Assad's ouster by a new, U.S.-backed Friends of Syriagroup, which was set up as a forum to support the Syrian opposition after Russia and China closed the door on U.N. action by vetoing a Security Council resolution.
Although the group, including European and Arab nations and the United States, affirmed its support for Assad's ouster, it stopped short of offering aid to the divided and ill-defined Syrian opposition.
Also Monday, a new group called the Al-Nusra Front to Protect the Levant said it was behind a double suicide bombing in Aleppo this month and a Jan. 6 bombing in Damascus that killed dozens.
In a videotaped message posted on a jihadi Web site that recounted details of the attacks, the group vowed to avenge the killings of Syrians by government forces wherever they occur and said that only armed revolt would bring down the Assad regime. It was the first claim of responsibility for the bombings, and though it could not be verified, the group's video comes amid growing concerns that al-Qaeda-linked groups are attempting to infiltrate the Syrian uprising.

BEIRUT-Dozens of residents of the Syrian city of Homs have been gunned down by security forces as they attempted to flee the stricken Bab Amr neighborhood, which has been under siege for the past 24 days, human rights activists and opposition groups said on Monday.
The Local Coordination Committees, an opposition group, said the bodies of 64 men were found shot to death in two areas of wasteland on the outskirts of Syria's third largest city Monday morning, and that an unknown number of women and children who had been with them are missing.
The deaths were among 124 reported across Syria on Monday as the Syrian government's efforts to quell the nearly year-long uprising against President Bashar al-Assad's rule showed no sign of letting up.
They included an additional 25 victims of the continued shelling of the Bab Amr neighborhood, which has been subjected to daily bombardments by tank and artillery fire since a massive offensive launched February 3 aimed at crushing anti-government resistance in what had emerged as one of the biggest strongholds of the loosely organized Free Syrian Army rebel movement.
Abu Emad, an activist in Homs, said the 64 men were among a large group of families who were trying to flee the besieged neighborhood overnight when their vehicles were stopped at a checkpoint close to the main highway leading to Damascus. The families were herded onto four buses, he said, citing the accounts of survivors, and they were told they were being taken to a safe place.
After a short distance the elderly passengers were ordered off the buses, and the rest were driven away. At daybreak, local residents discovered the bodies of the men, and the whereabouts of the women and children who were with them are unknown, he said.
"They killed all the young men," he said. "Maybe there are more, we still don't know."
The human rights advocacy group Avaaz gave a similar account of the incident, but put the number of bodies found at 62. Avaaz said it had confirmed that the corpses had been taken to the National Hospital in Homs.

Ohio shooting leaves 1 dead, 4 wounded

DATELINE: CHARDON, OHIO

CHARDON, Ohio - A teenager opened fire in the cafeteria at a suburban Cleveland high school Monday, killing one student and wounding four others before being chased from the building by a teacher and captured a short distance away, authorities said. 
A student who saw the attack said it appeared that the gunman targeted a group of students sitting together and that one victim was shot while trying to duck under the cafeteria table.
FBI officials would not comment on a motive. Chardon Police Chief Tim McKenna said authorities "have a lot of homework to do yet" in their investigation of the shooting, which sent students screaming through the halls at the start of the school day at 1,100-student Chardon High.
Teachers locked down their classrooms as they had been trained to do during drills, and students took cover as they waited for the all-clear. One teacher was said to have dragged a wounded student into his classroom for protection. Another chased the gunman out of the building, police said.
An education official said the suspected shooter attends Lake Academy, an alternative school whose students may have had academic or behavioral problems.
Brian Bontempo, the superintendent of the Lake County Educational Service Center, which operates the academy, declined to answer any questions about the student.
The suspect, whose name was not released because he is a juvenile, was arrested near his car half a mile away, the FBI said. He was not immediately charged.
Fifteen-year-old Danny Komertz, who witnessed the shooting, said the suspect was known as an outcast who had apparently been bullied. But other students disputed that.
"Even though he was quiet, he still had friends," said Tyler Lillash, 16. "He was not bullied."
Parents in this town of 5,100 people, 30 miles from Cleveland, learned of the attack from students via text message and cellphones and anxiously thronged streets near the school.
Two of the wounded were listed in critical condition, and another was in serious condition.
"I looked up and this kid was pointing a gun about 10 feet away from me to a group of four kids sitting at a table," Komertz said. He said the gunman fired two shots, and students scrambled for safety. One of them was "trying to get underneath the table, trying to hide, protecting his face."
The slain student, Daniel Parmertor, was an aspiring computer repairman who was waiting in the cafeteria for the bus for his daily 15-minute ride to a vocational school. His teacher at the Auburn Career School had no idea why Parmertor, "a verygood young man, very quiet," had been targeted, said Auburn'ssuperintendent, Maggie Lynch.

Veteran might avoid gun charges

BYLINE: Christian Davenport

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B05

DATELINE: ROANOKE

ROANOKE -  Sean Duvall, the Navy veteran charged with fabricating a homemade gun after calling a suicide hotline last year, would avoid prosecution if he completes court-mandated counseling under an agreement reached in federal court Monday.
Duvall, a 45-year-old Persian Gulf War veteran who lives outside Roanoke, was charged with four counts related to the manufacturing of the weapon after calling a suicide crisis hotline run by the Department of Veterans Affairs in June.
The case outraged veterans groups, who said the government should not prosecute those seeking help. They feared that Duvall's prosecution could have a chilling effect on distressed veterans at a time when they are committing suicide at a rate of 18 per day. 
And they were flabbergasted that the man in charge of the office pursuing the charges against Duvall was Timothy Heaphy, the U.S. attorney for the Western District of Virginia, who is the son-in-law of VA Secretary Eric K. Shinseki, an advocate for helping troubled veterans rather punishing them.
Prosecutors initially argued that they had every right to charge Duvall, who admitted to being armed with a gun when he called the hotline from the campus of Virginia Tech. But during a hearing Monday, the government changed course and recommended that Duvall be admitted to counseling overseen by a new Veterans Treatment Court. If completed, the charges, which carried a prison sentence of up to 40 years, would be dropped.
After the hearing, Duvall, a graduate of Gar-Field High School in Woodbridge, said he was thankful for the chance to continue putting his life back together. But the veteran, who enlisted in the Navy in 1991 and deployed to the Persian Gulf and off the coast of Somalia before being honorably discharged in 1995, said he was "confused as to why they came after me." He assumed that the VA hotline was confidential, as advertised.
He also said he was concerned about "the veterans that are coming back [from Iraq and Afghanistan]. I know it's going to be rough for them."
Duvall, homeless and unemployed, had been wandering the streets for a week before  his call to the crisis hotline, according to court documents. He was despondent and reeling, he said, from the death of his father.
In his backpack, he carried a final note to his family, a letter confirming his eligibility to be buried in the Southwest Virginia Veterans Cemetery and a homemade gun fashioned from a pipe. While on the campus of Virginia Tech, where he had worked previously as a part-time cook, he called the VA's suicide hotline shortly after midnight and told the counselor he was going to kill himself.
A police officer who arrived a short time later took Duvall, a divorced father of two, to a psychiatric facility, where he was treated for depression.
But a week later he was charged by state authorities with carrying a concealed weapon without a license. Eventually, those charges were dismissed so that the U.S. Attorney's Office could prosecute the case in federal court.
During Monday's hearing, Assistant U.S. Attorney Donald Wolthuis said authorities were concerned that an armed and mentally unstable person was on the campus of Virginia Tech,the site of a massacre in 2007 in which 32 people died and two dozen were wounded before the gunman killed himself.
Wolthuis also said Duvall's criminal history - which included public intoxication, driving while intoxicated and destruction of property - also factored in to the decision to charge him.
Heaphy said the fact that Duvall was a veteran didn't register with him at first. He said that prosecutors were focused more on the fact that Duvall had taken a weapon onto Virginia Tech's campus.
"That he was a veteran was never really a focus," said Heaphy, whose father in-law is  a former Army chief of staff.
After Heaphy reviewed the case, which received widespread media attention, he said he thought that "maybe we ought to take a deep breath." The veterans court, he said, would help Duvall fix "the underlying issue that led to the commission of this crime."
Asked whether he should have referred Duvall's case to the veterans court at the beginning, he said he wasn't sure. "I can't say I would have done it differently," he said. "I do think there is a value in demonstrating how serious law enforcement is at Virginia Tech."
He said Duvall's case was the first felony referred to the Virginia veterans court, which typically takes misdemeanors. Veterans courts are modeled after drug courts and are a relatively new way to help veterans get substance abuse and mental health treatment. If the programs proscribed by the court are completed, charges are often dropped.
Under the deal approved Monday, Duvall will be required to appear in the veterans court monthly to update the judge on his progress. If after six months he continues to show improvement, the charges would be dropped.
About a dozen veterans came to the hearing Monday to show support for Duvall. Dan Karnes, president of the Roanoke Valley Veterans Council, said he was angry that the charges were ever filed. Sending Duvall for treatment "is what they should have done from the beginning," he said.
Duvall, though, said he wasn't angry. The call to the crisis hotline, he said, saved his life. The counselor on the other end of the line, he said, "talked me through a very difficult time."

Southern Libya tense after tribal warfare, U.N. reports

BYLINE: Rami al-Shaheibi

LENGTH: 450 words

DATELINE: BENGHAZI, LIBYA

BENGHAZI, Libya - The United Nations said Monday that the situation in a remote southern part of Libya where more than 100 people were killed in tribal warfare this month remains tense, although a cease-fire brokered by local officials is still holding. 
A statement by the U.N. Support Mission in Libya said that as much as half of the population of Kufra has fled and that around 200 foreign migrants are waiting to be moved out of the area.
The clashes that broke out Feb. 11 underscore the struggle facing Libya's new leaders to enforce security, disarm residents and unify multiple militias that took part in an eight-month civil war that ended with the capture and killing of longtime ruler Moammar Gaddafi in October.
Dozens were killed this month by rockets, mortars and gunfire that rocked residential areas in the desert town, which is some 500 miles from the more populated coastal city of Derna.
The U.N. said it provided food, medicine, mattresses, blankets and hygiene kits to vulnerable communities whose basic services have been interrupted by the fighting in Kufra.
The injured packed the city's three-room hospital for days during the clashes. Many of the wounded had no beds. There was one doctor and 15 nurses at the facility, who used empty water bottles as blood bags. Patients had to share one ventilator.
For days, rescuers were unable to get to the bodies of victims left on the street.
An Associated Press reporter who was in Kufra during the clashes saw at least 160 houses demolished by rockets in one neighborhood. Families gathered inside a school seeking shelter, but even that came under shelling.
Shops were closed for days, and no one could walk in the street without risking injury. If one tribe took over one square, the other tribe opened fire and drove it out.
The fighting in Kufra, a border area where Libya, Chad and Sudan meet, involved the powerful Arab tribe of al-Zwia and the African Tabu tribe. The region is a hub for the smuggling of African migrants, goods and drugs.
The two tribes are old rivals and speak different languages. The Tabu have long complained of discrimination under Gaddafi.
Eissa Abdel-Majed, once an opposition figure who founded a group calling for an autonomous state for the Tabu people, said Gaddafi's regime would expel Tabu students from schools, take their passports and deprive families of bank loans.
Gaddafi also tried to change the demography of the city by offering incentives to al-Zwia tribe members to move to Kufra, so they would outnumber the Tabu.
The clashes erupted after an al-Zwia smuggler shot and killed six Tabu tribesmen guarding a border crossing, lifting the lid on a long-suppressed ethnic conflict.

and the world got the AIDS epidemic

BYLINE: Craig Timberg and Daniel Halperinby Craig Timberg and Daniel Halperin

SECTION: HEALTH; Pg. E01

LENGTH: 2448 words

We are unlikely to ever know all the details of the birth of the AIDS epidemic. But a series of recent genetic discoveries have shed new light on it, starting with the moment when a connection from chimp to human changed the course of history.
We now know where the epidemic began: a small patch of dense forest in southeastern Cameroon. We know when: within a couple of decades on either side of 1900. We have a good idea of how: A hunter caught an infected chimpanzee for food, allowing the virus to pass from the chimp's blood into the hunter's body, probably through a cut during butchering.
As to the why, here is where the story gets even more fascinating, and terrible. We typically think of diseases in terms of how they threaten us personally. But they have their own stories. Diseases are born. They grow. They falter, and sometimes they die. In every case these changes happen for reasons. 
For decades nobody knew the reasons behind the birth of the AIDS epidemic. But it is now clear that the epidemic's birth and crucial early growth happened during Africa's colonial era, amid massive intrusion of new people and technology into a land where ancient ways still prevailed. European powers engaged in a feverish race for wealth and glory blazed routes up muddy rivers and into dense forests that had been traveled only sporadically by humans before.
The most disruptive of these intruders were thousands of African porters. Forced into service by European colonial powers, they cut paths through the exact area that researchers have now identified as the birthplace of the AIDS epidemic. It was here, in a single moment of transmission from chimp to human, that a strain of virus called HIV-1 group M first appeared.
In the century since, it has been responsible for 99 percent of all of the world's deaths from AIDS - not just in Africa but in Moscow, Bangkok, Rio de Janeiro, San Francisco, New York, Washington. All that began when the West forced its will on an unfamiliar land, causing the essential ingredients of the AIDS epidemic to combine.
It was here, by accident but with motives by no means pure, that the world built a tinderboxand tossed in a spark.

The chimps of Cameroon
Many simians, such as gorillas and monkeys, can carry a virus that resembles HIV. But scientists now know that HIV-1 group M was born from a virus circulating among a community of chimpanzees concentrated in Cameroon, a sprawling country with bustling Atlantic Ocean ports, populous highlands, and a lightly developed southern region where relatively few people live even today. This was home to the chimps.
Finding a more exact location took a remarkable degree of scientific ingenuity. An international research team led by Beatrice Hahn of the University of Alabama at Birmingham and Paul Sharp of the University of Edinburgh developed an elaborate project that involved searching for the simian virus in chimp feces collected across a vast swath of southern Cameroon.
To find a strain of the simian virus that was, on a genetic level, essentially indistinguishable from the most lethal form of HIV, the research team set up 10 stations across the region. Two of the stations were in the particularly remote southeastern corner of the nation, as far as possible from major population centers.
It was in these two stations where Hahn and Sharp's team discovered samples of the simian virus that was almost a perfect match for the HIV-1 group M that eventually killed tens of millions of humans.
This discovery, published in the journal Science in 2006, intensified the quest for a birth date for the virus. Again, genetic research offered the key clues.
Scientists had long known that a blood sample, preserved from 1959, showed that HIV had been circulating in Kinshasa, the capital of Congo, for several decades before the virus first drew international attention in the 1980s. In 2008, evolutionary biologist Michael Worobey sharpened that picture when he reported in the journal Nature the discovery of a second sample of the virus, trapped in a wax-encased lymph node biopsy from 1960.
By comparing these two historic pieces of virus and mapping out the differences in their genetic structures in his lab at the University of Arizona, Worobey determined that HIV-1 group M was much older than anyone had thought. Both samples of the virus appeared to have descended from a single ancestor at some time between 1884 and 1924. The most likely date was 1908.
Taken together, these two discoveries offered the clearest clues to the birth and early life of the epidemic.
Not far from where HIV-1 group M was born was a major river, the Sangha, flowing toward the heart of Central Africa. This section of the Sangha was not ideal for navigation because of its ribbons of sandbars and the dense vegetation along its banks.
In the especially treacherous middle section, near where Hahn and Sharp's team found the viral ancestor of HIV, few major human settlements ever developed. But there were numerous communities on the Sangha's more accessible stretches. And due south, past riverside trading towns, was the mighty Congo River itself, the superhighway of Central Africa.
Once the virus made the jump from chimp to human, a single infected person could have carried HIV down the Sangha, onto the Congo River and into Kinshasa. The Belgians had founded the city in 1881, during what historians call "The Scramble for Africa," when colonial powers carved up the continent into areas of influence. By the early 20th century Kinshasa, then called Leopoldville, was the biggest city in Central Africa, fueled by the dizzying growth of trade with the outside world.
A final, powerful bit of evidence supported the theory that Kinshasa lay at the heart of the epidemic's early movements.
Scientists studying HIV-1 group M already had found many related varieties, what scientists call subtypes, each with slightly different genetic structures and paths through the world. One, scientists discovered, had traveled east from Kinshasa toward Lake Victoria. One went south to Zambia, Botswana and South Africa. One hopped all the way across the ocean to Haiti, then to the United States and Europe.
Many others traveled not very far at all, staying in the Congo Basin. But as scientists plotted out the genetic histories of these varieties and built an extensive family tree for HIV, they all appeared to have spread from a single explosion, a big bang of the AIDS epidemic: Ground Zero was Kinshasa.

Ivory and rubber
Powering the big bang was the burgeoning trade of colonial Africa.
Ivory may seem a touch quaint today, but in its heyday it was seen as beautiful, versatile and essential to many everyday products. It was used to make billiard balls, jewelry and cutlery. Furniture makers incorporated it into their cabinets, artists into their statues. Bagpipe makers used ivory for mounts, ferrules, buttons and mouthpieces.
When supplies of ivory gradually grew short, as colonial agents killed the once plentiful elephants by the thousands, rubber took its place as the economic lifeblood of colonialism in the Congo Basin. The first inflatable rubber tires for bicycles became popular in the 1890s. Mass production of cars soon spiked demand for rubber tires again.
The only obstacle to European companies' reaping huge profits was that collecting ivory and rubber required massive amounts of labor. Getting ivory from an elephant meant stalking the animal, killing it and cutting off its tusks. Getting rubber from vines required slashing them, collecting the oozing white sap and drying it - sometimes on the collector's own skin.
The solution to the manpower demands soon became obvious. Colonial powers created what was essentially slavery: cheap muscle at the point of a gun.
This approach was not confined to collecting ivory and rubber. These industries created tremendous new needs for infrastructure to get goods to oceangoing ships along the Atlantic coast. That meant African porters had to carry goods and supplies anyplace the steamboats couldn't reach.
Workers were needed to build railroads, trading stations, dormitories. And somebody needed to operate the steamboats, load the railroad cars, carry the tusks or gobs of rubber in from the jungle. When workers became unruly, the colonial companies deployed heavily armed soldiers to keep the cogs of these vast enterprises moving.
All these roles were filled by Africans, many imported from villages hundreds or even thousands of miles away. African life here was beyond cheap. It was disposable. Contemporary accounts by journalists and missionaries tell of colonial officials across the Congo Basin ordering mass slaughters and the torching of restive villages while creating forced settlements that resembled nothing so much as concentration camps.

The role of African porters
In December 1895 German colonial authorities heard reports that Cameroon's southeastern corner contained fabulously rich ivory and rubber stocks awaiting exploitation.
The Germans soon after gave authority to a colonial company to take control of the region by force. Over the next four years they extended their power all the way through southeastern Cameroon and established a trading station on the Ngoko River about 75 miles upstream from where its waters merged with the Sangha. In the wedge of land defined by these two rivers, HIV either had just been born or soon would be.
The trading station was called Moloundou, and a busy town remains there today. But at the time it was almost unimaginably remote. Few human settlements had developed among these forbidding forests. And there were only two practical ways out: by steamship down the Ngoko to the Sangha and on to the Congo River; or overland by foot to the Atlantic.
The river route was the easier of the two, and steamships transported the bulk of the ivory and rubber collected in southeastern Cameroon. But overland routes were necessary to connect Moloundou with other trading stations and inland areas rich with rubber and ivory.
For these journeys the bounty was borne by Africans who carried loads averaging 55 pounds each. At the peak of the foot traffic that would develop between inland areas and the coast, the busy way station recorded more than a thousand porters passing by on a typical day.

Trade routes, disease routes
Ominously, something else followed the rubber trade through Cameroon: disease. Sleeping sickness, smallpox and skin infections were the most obvious.
Colonial authorities attempted mass inoculation campaigns for smallpox and set up quarantine zones that restricted where the porters were allowed to travel. But even so, the diseases spread.
Among them was syphilis, which arrived with the Europeans. In just a few years it reached epidemic proportions along porter routes and riverside trading posts in Cameroon and throughout the Congo Basin. It's impossible now to determine how much of this spread resulted from rapes as opposed to other kinds of encounters, but it's clear that colonial commerce created massive new networks of sexual interactions - and massive new transmissions of infections. (In later decades, transmission through the reuse of hypodermic needles in medical care probably had some role in HIV's spread as well.)
So HIV's first journey looked something like this: A hunter killed an infected chimp in the southeastern Cameroonian forest, and a simian virus entered his body through a cut during the butchering, mutating into HIV.
This probably had happened many times before, during the centuries when the region had little contact with the outside world. But now thousands of porters - both men and women - were crossing through the area regularly, creating more opportunities for the virus to travel onward to a riverside trading station such as Moloundou.
One of the first victims - whether a hunter, a porter or an ivory collector - gave HIV to a sexual partner. There may have been a small outbreak around the trading station before the virus found its way aboard a steamship headed down the Sangha River.
For this fateful journey south, HIV could have ridden in the body of these first victims, or it could have been somebody infected later: a soldier or a laborer. Or it could have been carried by a woman: a concubine, a trader.
It's also possible that the virus moved down the river in a series of steps, maybe from Moloundou to Ouesso, then onward to Bolobo on the Congo River itself.
There might even have been a series of infections at trading towns along the entire route downriver. Yet even within these riverside trading posts HIV would have struggled to create anything more than a short-lived, localized outbreak.
Most of this colonial world didn't have enough potential victims for such a fragile virus to start a major epidemic. HIV is harder to transmit than many other infections. People can have sex hundreds of times without passing the virus on. To spread widely, HIV requires a population large enough to sustain an outbreak and a sexual culture in which people often have more than one partner, creating networks of interaction that propel the virus onward.
To fulfill its grim destiny, HIV needed a kind of place never before seen in Central Africa but one that now was rising in the heart of the region: a big, thriving, hectic place jammed with people and energy, where old rules were cast aside amid the tumult of new commerce.
It needed Kinshasa. It was here, hundreds of miles downriver from Cameroon, that HIV began to grow beyond a mere outbreak. It was here that AIDS grew into an epidemic.
Laying the scientific story alongside the historical one offers one final revelation. In the 1920s, as railroads became widely available, the Sangha River's value as a steamship route dwindled sharply. Global rubber prices also collapsed. The pace of human movement through the region eased.
So the improbable journey of the killer strain of HIV was feasible for only a few hectic decades, from the 1880s to the 1920s. Without "The Scramble for Africa," it's hard to see how HIV could have made it out of southeastern Cameroon to eventually kill tens of millions of people. Even a delay might have caused the killer strain of HIV to die a lonely death deep in the forest.

U.S. won't alter Afghan 'fundamental strategy'

BYLINE: Craig Whitlock

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A12

LENGTH: 821 words

The Pentagon said Monday that it will not change its "fundamental strategy" in Afghanistan despite a week of crises that have worsened the strained partnership between the Afghan government and U.S. and NATO forces.
U.S. officials acknowledged that tensions remain high in Kabul and that distrust has not dissipated since last weekend's killing of two U.S. military officers inside the Afghan Interior Ministry, apparently by a rogue Afghan security officer. 
The killings, which prompted Marine Gen. John Allen, the top U.S. and NATO commander, to pull service members from the ministries, have forced NATO advisers in Kabul to limit communication with Afghan government ministries to telephone and e-mail. U.S. officials said Monday that, although the measure is temporary, no date has been set for the advisers to return to work. 
The deaths of the two American officers on Saturday followed a similar incident two days earlier in which two U.S. troops were gunned down by an Afghan soldier in Nangahar province. At least 36 U.S. and NATO troops have been killed by Afghans wearing official police or army uniforms since the start of last year, according to a review of military casualty reports. 
The fratricidal attacks have fueled suspicions at a vulnerable time for the U.S. military and NATO, which are trying to partner more closely with Afghan security forces so they can take over responsibility for the war against the Taliban and other insurgents. Former U.S. officials and analysts have said the consequences of an erosion of confidence in the U.S.-Afghan partnership could be devastating for NATO's strategy to end combat operations by the end of 2014.
On Monday, Pentagon officials sought to play down the effects of those killings as well as the violent protests that erupted across Afghanistan beginning last week, when Afghans witnessed U.S. military personnel burning copies of the Koran at Bagram Air Base. U.S. officials have said that the burning of the Islamic holy book and other religious texts was accidental, but public apologies by President Obama and other leaders have not ended the fallout.
"Anyone who believes they can weaken our resolve through these cowardly attacks is severely mistaken," Pentagon press secretary George Little said at a news conference. "There is much at stake in Afghanistan, and our commitment to our mission and our strategy will not waver."
Still, violence has continued to spread. On Monday, nine people were killed in a suicide strike aimed at a NATO base in the eastern city of Jalalabad. A spokesman for NATO-led coalition forces said that no coalition service members were killed in the attack, in which a bomber detonated a car laden with explosives at the main entrance of the base.
Anthony H. Cordesman, a military analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who has served as a consultant for the Pentagon, said the recent crises are symptomatic of deeper problems undercutting the Obama administration's war strategy.
Among them, he said, are the persistence of insurgent networks, the existence of Taliban sanctuaries across the border in Pakistan, corruption within the Afghan government and poor coordination among NATO allies.
"It has been a truly grim week and one where these events raise questions about U.S. strategy and the value of continuing with the current approach to the war," Cordesman wrote Monday in an online commentary. "The reality, however, is that the strategy . . . has been dying for a long time."
U.S. and Afghan officials said they are still trying to identify the assailant who fatally shot two U.S. officers at close range Saturday in the Afghan Interior Ministry, one of the most closely guarded buildings in Kabul. Investigators are trying to determine whether other Afghans working in the ministry enabled his escape.
"We don't know all the facts surrounding how this individual got into this space and, frankly, was able to get out as quickly, and apparently as easily, as he did," said Navy Capt. John Kirby, a U.S. military spokesman in Kabul.
The officers killed in the attack have been identified as Army Maj. Robert J. Marchanti II, 48, of Baltimore, a member of the Maryland Army National Guard, and Air Force Lt. Col. John D. Loftis, 44, of Paducah, Ky., a member of the 866th Air Expeditionary Squadron.
Kirby said a joint NATO and Afghan investigation of the Koran burnings is continuing. NATO officials had said they would provide a public accounting last week for how the incident occurred, but they did not explain why there has been a delay.

Coroner: Hospitality exec killed himself
The president of South Carolina's Hospitality Association killed himself in the garage of his office building, officials said Tuesday, and the man's co-workers found a note referring to a federal investigation into the association's finances.  
Richland County Coroner Gary Watts said it appears that Tom Sponseller killed himself with a gunshot to his head.
Sponseller's body was found Tuesday behind two locked doors in a parking garage below his office, authorities said. A 9 mm handgun belonging to Sponseller was found at the scene. He had been missing for 10 days. 
On Monday, federal officials confirmed that they were investigating several hundred thousand dollars missing from the group that lobbies for South Carolina's tourism industry. U.S. Secret Service Special Agent in Charge Michael Williams said Sponseller had not been investigated specifically.
Instead, Williams said agents were focusing on Rachel Duncan, who has served as an accounting director for the association. Her attorney declined to comment but said Duncan had cooperated with the probe into Sponseller's disappearance.

Harvard group backs gays expelled in '20
Students and faculty at Harvard University are urging administrators to award posthumous degrees to seven students expelled from the Ivy League school in 1920 because they were gay or perceived to be gay.
The group plans to hold a rally Wednesday during a campus visit by Lady Gaga to launch her Born This Way anti-bullying foundation. 
The group says it wants Harvard to formally abolish its so-called "secret court," a tribunal that investigated charges of homosexual activity among students in 1920. The tribunal remained a secret for decades, only becoming public in 2002 after a student reporter  found details of it in Harvard's archives. 
Harvard administrators apologized for the court in 2002.

Hoosiers make Spartans their third top-five victim

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. D05

LENGTH: 446 words

Cody Zeller scored 18 points and Victor Oladipo added 13 to lead No. 18 Indiana past No. 5 Michigan State 70-55 on Tuesday night in Bloomington, Ind., for the Hoosiers' third victory over a top five team this season. 
Indiana (22-7, 10-7 Big Ten) is the second team to achieve that feat this season, joining Kansas. Indiana upset No. 1 Kentucky and No. 2 Ohio State in December and now Michigan State (24-6, 13-4), which could have clinched its second outright Big Ten title in four seasons with a victory.
"When we beat top teams like that we're nasty, we're scrappy, we're fighting," said senior Verdell Jones, who had 12 points. "But we haven't accomplished anything yet."
This time, Indiana didn't need a last-second shot or  last-second stop to win it. The Hoosiers took a page a page out of Michigan State's playbook, beating the Spartans with defense, rebounding and toughness.
It was Indiana Coach Tom Crean's first win over Tom Izzo, his former boss.
It looked as if the Spartans would challenge when Draymond Green scored six points in a 10-0 run to get them within 43-37 with 15:47 left in the game. But Indiana answered with four straight points to make it 47-37.
l DUKE 79, WAKE FOREST 71: Ryan Kelly scored a career-high 23 points and the No. 4 Blue Devils held on to beat the Demon Deacons in Winston-Salem, N.C.,  for their seventh straight win.
Kelly put up 20 points against the Demon Deacons for the third straight time, and Seth Curry finished with 15 points for Duke (26-4, 13-2 Atlantic Coast Conference), which led by 23 points with 9ֲ½ minutes left before Wake Forest made things tense late.
Nikita Mescheriakov and Tony Chennault both had 18 points for the Demon Deacons (13-16, 4-11). 
l WISCONSIN 52, MINNESOTA 45: Jordan Taylor scored 22 points as the No. 14 Badgers beat the Gophers in Madison, Wis., to clinch a first-round bye in the Big Ten tournament.
Both teams shot poorly, there were 43 fouls called and the teams combined to shoot 58 free throws. But Wisconsin (22-8, 11-6 Big Ten) found its shooting touch in the second half to secure at least a fourth-place finish in the conference.
Minnesota (17-13, 5-12) led 23-16 at halftime. Andre Hollins led the Gophers with 18 points, while Ralph Sampson III finished with eight to give him 1,004 for his career.
l VANDERBILT 77, FLORIDA 67: John Jenkins hit six three-pointers and scored 22 points in Nashville as the Commodores upset the No. 16 Gators.
Vanderbilt (21-9, 10-5 Southeastern Conference) outshot the nation's top three-point shooting team behind Jenkins, who topped his average of 3.9 three-pointers by hitting his first five from beyond the arc.
Bradley Beal scored 16 points Florida (22-8, 10-5).

A wanderer in New York

BYLINE: Nora Krug;- Nora Krug

SECTION: STYLE; Pg. C04

LENGTH: 801 words

Teju Cole's first novel, Open City (Random House, $15), arrives in paperback with an array of accolades as confusing as they are complimentary. A finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award, the book - a lyrical novel of ideas - has been likened to the works of W.G. Sebald, Joseph O'Neill, Zadie Smith, Nicholson Baker, Hemingway, Orwell, T.S. Eliot, even Camus. It would be difficult for any one work to resemble such a diverse roster, but that it has been so broadly interpreted may serve only to prove that this novel defies comparison. "Open City" is an accomplished - and at times vexing - work in its own right. 
Set mostly in Manhattan, the novel follows the inner life of its narrator, a half-Nigerian, half-German psychiatry resident named Julius. A wanderer, Julius is haunted by his past and drawn to the New York streetscape, where his meanderings trigger ponderous thoughts on a range of subjects such as  immigration, the consequences of 9/11,  New York history, bedbugs, the demise of Tower Records and ATM cards.  Julius lives the kind of rarefied existence that some might say can be found only in New York or in an art-house French film. He is a font of literary references and history. His encounters and conversations are heavy with meaning: The woman next to him on an airplane turns out to be a surgeon eager to discuss modern European history; at the post office, the clerk happens to be a poet with strong opinions on race.
Little happens in this impressionistic novel, but that hardly matters. The book is full of so many beautifully phrased observations that it's easy to be simply mesmerized. Cole's painterly style reflects his work as a street photographer and art historian. An alley, "no one's preferred route to any destination," he writes, "was all brick walls and shut-up doors, across which shadows fell as crisply as in an engraving." Of the rivers that surround New York, he writes: "The water was a kind of embarrassing secret, the unloved daughter, neglected, while the parks were doted on, fussed over, overused." A person seen from a distance is "small, slow, like a memory approaching." Cole's knack for such profound, pithy musings has helped popularize his Twitter feed. ("Don't give me a link. Tell me what you know," he wrote there recently.) His latest project, "Small Fates," a nonfiction narrative about Lagos, Nigeria, is told through concise news tidbits that read like epigrams. 
For all of Cole's artistry, however, his narrator's tendency to intellectualize detracts from the book's emotional impact. Late in the story, when Julius is the object of a potentially damaging accusation, he responds by citing (to himself) an anecdote about Camus and Nietzsche that requires the reader's patient unraveling - and perhaps a PhD in philosophy. It's an unsatisfying denouement in a book full of gemlike epiphanies.

From our previous reviews:
The late Manning Marable's biographyMalcolm X (Penguin, $18), a National Book Award and National Book Critics Circle finalist, "combines genres skillfully: biography, true-crime, political commentary" and "goes deeper and richer than a mere homage" to its subject, Wil Haygood wrote.
Adam Goodheart's 1861 (Vintage, $16) is "a peripatetic exploration of America on the brink of civil war" that shows "how the cumulative decisions of unsung individuals could have momentous consequences in this war that forever changed America," wrote Stephen Budiansky. 
Steven Levingston called Andrew Ferguson's Crazy U (Simon & Schuster, $16) "a hilarious narrative and an incisive guide to the college admissions process." 
In The School of Night (St. Martin's, $14.99), by Washington writer Louis Bayard, an Elizabethan scholar is drawn into a mystery surrounding a legendary group of 16th-century thinkers. Bayard deftly knits modern and historical story lines to create a brainy thriller with "tragic and jolting surprises," wrote Kathy Blumenstock.
The Sisters Brothers (Ecco, $14.99), Patrick deWitt's Booker-nominated tale of two hired guns during the Gold Rush, is "weirdly funny, startlingly violent and steeped in sadness," according to Ron Charles.
Wild Bill Donovan (Free Press, $16), Douglas Waller's "superb, dramatic yet scholarly biography" of William J. Donovan, wartime leader of the Office of Strategic Services, "tells a great deal about the man who built a far-flung intelligence organization from scratch in the midst of World War II," wrote David Wise.
In his "gently provocative" Almost Chimpanzee (St. Martin's, $15.99), Jon Cohen offers "a briskly told, clear-headed survey of research" suggesting that we should focus on the differences between chimpanzees and humans rather than the similarities, according to Deborah Blum.

Official drove 100 mph on Beltway, sources say

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B10

LENGTH: 275 words

A Prince George's County Council member who was ticketed last week for making an unsafe lane change on the Capital Beltway was going more than 100 mph, according to three law enforcement sources. 
Council member Karen R. Toles (D-Suitland) was traveling near Branch Avenue about noon Feb. 22 when a Prince George's  police officer saw her county-issued Ford Edge veer across lanes of traffic, the sources said. Toles was exceeding the 55-mph speed limit, and the officer turned on his lights and sirens and followed her car, the sources said.
The officer caught up to Toles after she exited on Branch Avenue, the sources said. She was given the ticket for an unsafe lane change - a violation that carries a $90 fine - and a warning for speeding.
Toles has been active in advocating public-safety legislation. She released a statement saying she was late for an appointment and intends to pay the fine. "I consider moving violations serious matters and I regret the incident," Toles wrote. 
 In a statement, Prince George's police said the warning was "consistent with the typical discretion applied by police officers to speeding motorists." 
The officer did not use a radar gun to clock Toles's speed, but his cruiser camera shows that he reached speeds as high as 108 mph, they said. On the warning, the officer wrote that Toles was traveling 105 mph, the sources said.
In Maryland, drivers are assessed points for offenses and can have their license suspended if they accrue eight points, said Rockville lawyer David Felsen.
Going 105 mph in a 55-mph zone carries 5 points and a recommended fine of $530, he added.

Judges pull out of case targeting NGOs
A panel of three judges overseeing a case targeting foreign and domestic nongovernmental organizations pulled out of the judicial proceedings Tuesday, marking the latest turn in a controversial investigation that intensified when Egyptian security forces raided the pro-democracy groups in December.
The case against the NGOs, including four U.S. groups, has plunged Egypt and the United States into a diplomatic crisis. Cairo accuses the civil society groups of operating illegally in Egypt, taking illegal foreign funds and conducting illegal political work. At least 16 Americans are among the accused, at least seven of whom are in the country and barred from leaving.  
In Washington, meanwhile, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said that "intensive discussions" continued with the Egyptian government and that she believed they were "moving toward a resolution." 
New judges will be appointed within the week and the case will resume April 26 as scheduled, said Abdel Moez Ibrahim, head of the Cairo Court of Appeals. 
Also Tuesday, Egypt's newly elected upper legislative chamber chose a member of the country's most powerful Islamist group as its speaker, extending the control of both houses of parliament to the Muslim Brotherhood's political wing.

Police shut downOccupy London sites
Authorities moved in on the Occupy London site at St. Paul's Cathedral soon after midnight Tuesday, clearing the cobbled churchyard of about 100 tents and arresting 20 people.
St. Paul's officials denied allegations that they had colluded in the eviction.
The Occupy London camp was set up in October, inspired by the Occupy Wall Street movement. The group's eviction appeal was dismissed last week. 
Anticipating their ouster, many of the protesters had already moved to the movement's other two London sites, in the Islington neighborhood, which was also cleared Tuesday, and in Finsbury Square.

16 Shiites killed in Pakistan: Gunmen wearing military uniforms stopped a convoy of buses in northern Pakistan's remote Kohistan region Tuesday, ordered selected passengers to get off and then killed 16 of them, all minority Shiite Muslims, police and lawmaker Abdul Sattar said. The victims were all Shiite Muslims, a minority in Pakistan that is frequently targeted by extremists from the majority Sunni community, Sattar said. The gunmen spared several dozen other people in the four-bus convoy. A spokesman for a faction of the Pakistani Taliban, a Sunni militant group, asserted responsibility for the killings.
12 reported killed in riots in western China: At least 12 people were killed in riots near the Chinese city of Kashgar in the northwestern region of Xinjiang, state media reported. Xinjiang is the scene of periodic outbreaks of anti-government violence by members of the region's native Turkish Muslim Uighurs. The Xinhua News Agency said that rioters armed with knives killed 10 people and that police fatally shot two assailants.
Chavez reported in good condition after surgery: Doctors successfully extracted a tumor from Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's pelvic region, and he was recovering in Cuba on Tuesday with relatives at his side, his vice president, Elias Jaua, announced. Jaua did not say when Chavez, 57, had the surgery.
Top French court strikes down genocide bill: France's Constitutional Council ruled that a new law that would make it illegal to deny the mass killing of Armenians by Ottoman Turks nearly a century ago is unconstitutional. Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said ministers would meet to consider whether to restart economic, political and military contacts with France, frozen since its parliament passed the law Jan. 23.
Stricken cruise ship due to reach land Thursday: Helicopters ferried food and flashlights to passengers and crew stranded aboard a disabled cruise ship that is being towed to the Seychelles through pirate-infested Indian Ocean waters, officials said. The Costa Allegra, which lost power Monday after a fire, has 636 passengers and 413 crew members on board, including eight U.S. passengers. 
Belarus presses E.U., Polish envoys to leave: Belarus has asked European Union ambassadors and the Polish envoy to leave the region, while recalling its own ambassadors in response to new E.U. sanctions. The moves came a day after the E.U. Council voted to add 21 names to a list of about 200 Belarusan officials prevented from traveling to E.U. countries because of alleged human rights violations. The officials also face an assets freeze.

Suspect in Ohio shootings is 'not well,' prosecutor says

DATELINE: CHARDON, OHIO

CHARDON, Ohio - The teenager accused of killing three students in a shooting rampage in an Ohio high school cafeteria chose his victims at random and is "someone who's not well," a prosecutor said Tuesday as the young man appeared in juvenile court. 
T.J. Lane, 17, admitted taking a .22-caliber pistol and a knife to Chardon High and firing 10 shots at students sitting at a cafeteria table Monday morning, prosecutor David Joyce said. He said Lane did not know the victims.
Lane will probably be charged with three counts of aggravated murder, the prosecutor said.
A thin figure with short, dark hair, Lane said little more than "Yes, sir" to questions from the judge. He sniffled and half-closed his eyes as he walked out of the room with sheriff's deputies.
The hearing came hours after the death toll rose to three, and as schoolmates and townspeople puzzled over what could have set off Lane, who was described as extremely quiet, with few friends.
After the hearing, the prosecutor appeared to rule out rumors that the gunman lashed out after being bullied or that the shooting was related to drug dealing.
"This is not about bullying. This is not about drugs," Joyce said. "This is someone who's not well." He would not elaborate.  
Lane's grandfather, who has custody of the teenager, and two aunts joined him in court.
Judge Timothy Grendell ordered Lane held for at least 15 days. In addition to imposing a gag order, the judge told journalists not to photograph Lane's face in court.   
Authorities said Tuesday that Demetrius Hewlin, 16, and Russell King Jr., 17, had died of injuries sustained in the attack. Another student, Daniel Parmertor, 16, perished just after the shooting.
Hewlin attended Chardon High. King and Parmertor were students at Auburn Career Center, a vocational school, and were waiting in Chardon's cafeteria for their bus when they were shot.
Lane attended Lake Academy, a school 16 miles from Chardon High that serves students with academic or behavioral problems. Authorities would not say why Lane ended up there.
Kala Day, 18, said she rode the morning school bus with Lane.
"He always sat by himself and, like, looked out the window," she said. "So I sat with him a few times, because I felt bad for the kid. He didn't talk. He just stared out the window."

War exploits depicted in 'Band of Brothers'

BYLINE: T. Rees Shapiro

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B06

LENGTH: 1046 words

Lynn D. "Buck" Compton, an Army paratrooper whose World War II service was portrayed in the book and HBO miniseries "Band of Brothers" and who later as a prosecutor secured a conviction of Robert F. Kennedy assassin Sirhan Sirhan, died Feb. 26 at his home in Burlington, Wash. He was 90.
He had complications from a heart attack, said his daughter Syndee Compton. Mr. Compton retired in 1990 as a judge on the California Courts of Appeal. 
Mr. Compton fought in some of the war's fiercest battles as a first lieutenant with E Company, 2nd Battalion, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division. The soldiers, collectively known as Easy Company, participated in the June 6, 1944, invasion of Normandy, parachuted into Holland for the disastrous Operation Market Garden, and fought through frostbite and German artillery in the Battle of the Bulge.
At 6 feet, 220 pounds, he had been a two-sport varsity athlete for the University of California at Los Angeles before he became an Army officer in 1943. He was a catcher alongside future major leaguer Jackie Robinson and played guard on the Bruins' line in the 1943 Rose Bowl. (UCLA lost 9-0 to the University of Georgia.)
In his 2008 memoir, "Call of Duty" (written with Marcus Brotherton), Mr. Compton recalled leaning out of a C-47 transport plane about 1 a.m. on D-Day.
"In the moonlight, I could see the Normandy coastline in the distance," he wrote. "It looked surprisingly peaceful in spite of what I could only imagine lay ahead. Tracer bullets and antiaircraft started to appear, red, blue and green tracers, spectacular and deadly against the night sky."
After regrouping on the ground, Mr. Compton and 1st Lt. Richard "Dick" Wintersled an assault on a German artillery emplacement near Brecourt Manor.
The battery was heavily fortified and protected by 50 German sentries. Entering a trench, Mr. Compton's baseball instincts took over when he saw German soldiers retreating.
"The distance to the fleeing enemy was about the same as from home plate to second base," historian Stephen Ambrose wrote in the 1992 book "Band of Brothers." Mr. Compton "threw his grenade on a straight line - no arch - and it hit a German in the head as it exploded."
For capturing the position and saving countless Allied lives, Mr. Compton received the Silver Star - the military's third-highest medal for valor in combat.
During Operation Market Garden, Mr. Compton was directing his men in battle when he was shot in the buttocks. He received the Purple Heart.
Upon recovering from his wounds, Mr. Compton rejoined Easy Company for the worst fighting the unit encountered in the war. Holed up in a forest near Bastogne, Belgium, during the Battle of the Bulge, the soldiers endured below-freezing temperatures and heavy snow while German forces splintered the trees with artillery fire.
"I had seen men die before. I had seen men get wounded before," Mr. Compton wrote in "Call of Duty." "But this was different. This was unprecedented gore."
After one battle, Mr. Compton emerged from his foxhole to find the mangled bodies of a dozen of his men, their blood staining the snow. He ran to find medical treatment for the wounded before sitting down on a fallen tree and sobbing over the loss of his friends.
"He had stood up to everything the Germans had thrown at him," Ambrose wrote in "Band of Brothers." "But the sight of his platoon being decimated, of his . . . friends torn into pieces, unnerved him."
He was relieved from his position - officially for a severe case of trench foot - and spent the rest of the war away from combat.
In the 2001 Emmy Award-winning HBO miniseries, adapted from Ambrose's book and co-produced by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, Mr. Compton's character is played by Neal McDonough.
Lynn Davis Compton was born Dec. 31, 1921, in Los Angeles. After the war, Mr. Compton worked his way through Loyola University's law school as a detective in the Los Angeles police department. He graduated from Loyola in 1949.
His first marriage, to Jerry Star, ended in divorce. His wife of 46 years, the former Donna Newman, died in 1994. Survivors include two children from his second marriage, Syndee Compton and Tracy Compton, both of Burlington; and four grandchildren.
In 1951, Mr. Compton became an assistant district attorney in Los Angeles. He led the team of prosecutors assigned to the 1969 trial of Sirhan Sirhan, a 24-year-old Jordanian immigrant who assassinated presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy in the Ambassador Hotel kitchen.
Sirhan had said he vehemently disagreed with Kennedy's support of Israel. During court proceedings, Sirhan's lawyers argued that their client was mentally unstable.
In his closing statements, Mr. Compton attacked the defense.
"Did Robert Francis Kennedy, a young, highly successful man at the peak of his career . . . breathe his last breath on the dirty floor of a pantry in the Ambassador Hotel among the mops and dirty dishes . . . because he supported the Israeli state or because he became a complicated father image in the mind of Sirhan B. Sirhan?"
Mr. Compton told the jury: "If you buy all this, you have to turn him loose. But if you don't buy it, there's nothing left but a plain, old, coldblooded first-degree murder."
The jury found Sirhan guilty. He is serving a life sentence in prison.
In 1970, California Gov. Ronald Reagan appointed Mr. Compton to the state's appellate court. Toward the end of his career, Mr. Compton became a forceful advocate for patients in "right-to-die" cases.
In 1986, he ruled that a woman incapacitated by cerebral palsy - and who wished to die by starvation - be allowed to refuse medical assistance and to have her physicians remove a feeding tube that was keeping her alive. In the end, the woman, Elizabeth Bouvia, decided not to commit suicide.
In an opinion, Mr. Compton wrote: "Whatever choice Elizabeth Bouvia may ultimately make, I can only hope that her courage, persistence and example will cause our society to deal realistically with the plight of those unfortunate individuals to whom death beckons as a welcome respite from suffering."
"If there is ever a time when we ought to be able to get the 'government off our backs,' " Mr. Compton wrote, "it is when we face death - either by choice or otherwise."

A Genesis: Equality in Mormonism

BYLINE: Jason Horowitz

SECTION: STYLE; Pg. C03

LENGTH: 2385 words

On Dec. 25, 1964, as Mitt Romney enjoyed his last Christmas break as a high school student in Michigan, two Mormon missionaries visited Darius Gray in Colorado Springs and asked him whether he had any last questions before joining the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
He had one. A proud African American, Gray expressed wariness over a description in the Book of Mormon of a dark-skinned tribe being out of favor with God and asked, "How, in any way, does that relate to me?" The younger of the two missionaries stood off to the side as his senior companion explained, "Well, Brother Gray, the primary implication is that you won't be able to hold the priesthood."
After a tumultuous night of prayer, Gray still felt a call to join the faith and went on to help found the Genesis Group, an official church support group for African American Mormons, which he believes paved the way for the 1978 lifting of the ban on blacks in the priesthood. It was an anguishing period that coincided with Romney's full embrace of his faith and his rise within it. 
The mere mention of Romney and the church's ban on blacks is fraught. If he gets the nomination, the nation's first Mormon presidential nomineewill challenge the first black president. Romney, the son of former Michigan governor George Romney, who had a strong record of civil rights activism, bears no responsibility for the doctrines of his church. But in the prolonged Mormon debate over whether the ban resulted from divine doctrine or inherited historical racism, Romney appears to have embraced the prevailing view: The ban was the word of God and thus unalterable without divine intervention. 
Gray, who still chokes up discussing the day the church lifted the ban, wants to know more about Romney's perspective on the ban and how he struggled with it. 
"It's a marvelous question," said Gray. "But there is only one person who can answer it." 
The Romney campaign declined to expound upon the candidate's  thinking at the time.

A time of upheaval
As the son of George Romney, the Michigan governor and a leading voice for civil rights within the Republican Party, Mitt was well regarded by the few black students at the prestigious Cranbrook School outside Detroit.
"I was the only African American in my class," said Sidney Barthwell Jr., a Romney classmate and later a classmate of Barack Obama at Harvard Law School. "I knew about the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and that they didn't allow blacks to ascend to the priesthood. I knew that then. But George Romney was a tremendous social liberal and a tremendous supporter of the social rights movement."
Barthwell, now a magistrate in Michigan, said he never got any sense that Mitt Romney saw African Americans as anything but equals and that the Mormon church's ban never arose as an issue at school. But the subject became unavoidable as Romney returned from his mission in France and enrolled at Brigham Young University in 1969. The priesthood ban contributed to unprecedented volatility on campus.
In October of that year, 14 black players lost their places on the University of Wyoming's powerhouse football team for planning to wear black armbands in protest of the ban during their game against BYU. Stanford University, which Romney had previously attended, took the opposite stance, announcing at the end of 1969 that it would boycott athletic competitions with the church-owned university.
"I do remember Mitt being really angry with Stanford," said Kim Cameron, a friend at the time. "He felt like it was, A, naive, and, B, sort of a bigoted, narrow-minded perspective."
In the early '70s, when Romney served as a leader of BYU's sports booster organization, called the Cougar Club, opposing teams would throw tomatoes and worse at BYU players and their fans. According to Dane McBride, a member of the club and one of Romney's closest friends, there was a pervasive sense in the club that BYU was "under siege" from the protests. Their retaliation, he said, was to "raise more money for the school."
Furthermore, said McBride, the very notion of questioning the doctrinal ban was considered "unseemly as well as useless."
But that was not a uniform view.
Gray, the black Mormon pioneer, saw the ban as more a product "of the racial attitudes of this nation." While he understood that only a revelation from the top of the church could end the oppression, "We could advocate for it, lobby."
Mormon boys join the priesthood at age 12, a sacred rite that Mormons believe was restored to them by John the Baptist through Joseph Smith in 1829 after millennia of apostasy. At age 18, Mormon men enter a higher-level priesthood that allows them to serve as missionaries, hold positions of church authority and bestow the priesthood on others.
At church functions, Gray said, he and other black Mormons suffered the assurances of their white brethren that "you will have the priesthood in the world to come," or encouragements that if they lived worthy lives, "you will find your skin will become lighter and lighter." 
As Romney bristled against the protests in Provo, Gray and two other black Mormons in Salt Lake expressed their frustrations to the church hierarchy. The church president at the time, the conservative Joseph Fielding Smith, responded by assigning three junior apostles - Gordon B. Hinckley, who would become president of the church; Thomas S. Monson, the current president; and Boyd K. Packer, who is next in line to be president - to meet with the three men. In an acknowledgment of their travails, the church established the Genesis Group in October 1971, although they reiterated, according to Gray, that the doctrine was a "policy of God" and that it would "take a revelation to change it."

The origins of the policy
The ground floor of the Joseph Smith building, which houses BYU's religion department, showcases a likeness of the golden tablets from which Joseph Smith is said to have translated the Book of Mormon. Paintings upstairs depict the Lamanites, the tribe in Mormon scripture that bears dark skin as a sign of God's curse.
In his office, religion professor Randy Bott explains a possible theological underpinning of the ban. According to Mormon scriptures, the descendants of Cain, who killed his brother, Abel, "were black." One of Cain's descendants was Egyptus, a woman Mormons believe was the namesake of Egypt. She married Ham, whose descendants were themselves cursed and, in the view of many Mormons, barred from the priesthood by his father, Noah. Bott points to the Mormon holy text the Book of Abraham as suggesting that all of the descendants of Ham and Egyptus were thus black and barred from the priesthood.
It's not clear whether Joseph Smith, the religion's founder, who ordained at least one black priest, supported the ban. But his successor, Brigham Young, enforced it enthusiastically as the word of God, supporting slavery in Utah and decreeing that the "mark" on Cain was "the flat nose and black skin." Young subsequently urged immediate death to any participant in mixing of the races. As recently as 1949, church leaders suggested that the ban on blacks resulted from the consequences of the "conduct of spirits in the pre-mortal existence." As a result, many Mormons believed that blacks were less valiant in the pre-Earth life, or fence sitters in the war between God and Satan. That view has fallen out of favor in recent decades.
"God has always been discriminatory" when it comes to whom he grants the authority of the priesthood, says Bott, the BYU theologian. He quotes Mormon scripture that states that the Lord gives to people "all that he seeth fit." Bott compares blacks with a young child prematurely asking for the keys to her father's car, and explains that similarly until 1978, the Lord determined that blacks were not yet ready for the priesthood.
"What is discrimination?" Bott asks. "I think that is keeping something from somebody that would be a benefit for them, right? But what if it wouldn't have been a benefit to them?" Bott says that the denial of the priesthood to blacks on Earth - although not in the afterlife - protected them from the lowest rungs of hell reserved for people who abuse their priesthood powers. "You couldn't fall off the top of the ladder, because you weren't on the top of the ladder. So, in reality the blacks not having the priesthood was the greatest blessing God could give them."
The current president of the Genesis Group, Don Harwell, considers such thinking vile. Driving to a local shooting range, he pulls over to find a bit of Mormon scripture on his iPhone.
"He denieth none that come unto him, black and white, bond and free," reads Harwell. "I have it right here."
Harwell joined the church 30 years ago after his "womanizing" ended his marriage. As a young man, he considered Mormons "racists" for their ban on black priests, but in 1983  he met a women who was Mormon and underwent a profound spiritual conversion. That marriage eventually didn't work out because "it was hard for white girls married to black guys" in those days, he says.
At the Magna Gun Club, he opens up his rifle case, which displays a business card identifying him as the Genesis Group president, and laments the lousy shooting conditions with his friends - overwhelmingly white, Mormon and regretful of their church's past.
On the drive back to Salt Lake, Harwell makes it clear he does not appreciate any attempt to connect the historic plight of blacks in the church to Romney, whom he strongly supports.
"This is the only stuff they can come up with," Harwell says, referring to Romney's political enemies. While he gives credit to church leaders who agitated against the ban, he acquits rank-and-file members who remained quiet. "We have prophets, seers and revelators as our leaders, and we have to follow them," Harwell says, emphasizing that Romney "had no control over what the church did."

A revelation
As Romney left Utah and moved to Massachusetts, a debate raged in Mormon intellectual circles between those who accepted the ban as doctrine and those who considered it a temporal policy. Progressives argued that the ban's origins lay in pioneers seeking to appease anti-abolitionists as they passed through Missouri.
In 1973, Lester E. Bush, an amateur Mormon historian, made a strong case that no church president had ever received a revelation instituting the ban and thus no revelation was required to lift it. The next year, in the face of a potential NAACP lawsuit, the hierarchy quietly reversed another policy against performing baptisms of the dead and allowed other sacred rites "for people who had any Negro blood in their veins." But the major issue was still the priesthood.
"There were internal conversations at the highest levels," said Philip Barlow, a professor of Mormon history and religion.
Romney remained disengaged with the issue. "I don't remember conversing with him about it," said Barlow, who served as a counselor to Romney in the Boston church. Romney "was a very practical leader, not a theologian, not a historian, not a scholar but a business genius."
In June 1978, Church President Spencer W. Kimball announced that God has "heard our prayers, and by revelation has confirmed that the long-promised day has come" in which "all worthy male members of the Church may be ordained to the priesthood without regard for race or color."
The lifting of the ban, which, like the church's anti-polygamy Manifesto, is now part of church scripture, was an indelible moment that many Mormons consider the most emotional in their lives. Romney has said he pulled his car over to the side of the road to weep with joy upon learning of the lifting of the ban. "Even at this day it's emotional," he said in 2007 on "Meet the Press."
Only five months after his revelation, Kimball dedicated a flagship temple in Brazil, a key gateway for expansion for a growing church. Soon after, the church sought to cleanse the aura of racism from church textbooks and, in 1981, even from a scriptural passage, in which a righteous tribe is described as "pure" rather than "white."
More than three decades later, the church says it still doesn't know where the ban came from.
"Though the origins of the priesthood restriction are unclear, it was understood that a change would require revelation," said church spokesman Michael Purdy, who called the lifting of the ban "a day of great rejoicing" that led  to "robust growth in Africa and racially diverse areas of the United States and Latin America."
But the church will not say whether the revelation was necessary to lift the ban or to give the policy reversal the force of absolute authority.
What is clear is that the consequences of the ban are still rippling.
"When I did my mission in Atlanta, there were still some people who are hurt, people wouldn't join because of it. They feel that it wasn't based on revelation, that it was purely discrimination," Barima Kwarteng, 24, a computer engineering major from Ghana, said as he carried books into the BYU library. "Some people were like, 'Why are you a part of this church?' "
Nearby, in the Wilkinson Center, students attended a '70s dance in honor of Black History Month. They dressed in funky outfits and listened to a DJ playing "Brick House" under a slideshow featuring a dunking Dr. J, the cast of "Diff'rent Strokes" and a box of Count Chocula cereal.
Ashley Wright, 19, a business management major, attended the party with an Asian American friend wearing an Afro wig.
"Growing up, I always thought it was a long time ago," Wright, who is white, said of the ban. "I thought that was forever ago. But then I was like, 'my parents were alive then.' "
Navirlene Volcy, a 19-year-old African American student majoring in neuroscience, spent the evening dancing in a circle with friends - some black, some not.
To her, the ban was a recent revelation.
"It kind of surprised me," said Volcy. "There's a class here where they talk about Brigham Young having feelings that colored people were inferior. How can you be a prophet and commune with God and think that?"
She said she'd like to know what Romney thought about the church's complicated racial past, but she added: "I'm not sure it would make a difference. It hasn't made me leave the church. People are imperfect."

Terps find task too big at UNC

DATELINE: CHAPEL HILL, N.C.

CHAPEL HILL, N.C. - There was no denying North Carolina's Tyler Zeller in his final game at the Dean E. Smith Center.Maryland ran out of big bodies trying.
Zeller scored a game-high 30 points, getting to the free throw line as if by birthright on senior night, to pace North Carolina's 88-64 rout of Maryland on Wednesday.
The game would have been more lopsided had North Carolina Coach Roy Williams not retired Zeller, the 7-foot center whose 20 made free throws on 23 attempts were both Smith Center records, with nearly seven minutes remaining and 6-11 forward John Henson (19 points, nine rebounds) soon after. 
It underscored the considerable gulf between the teams in skill, depth, experience, with North Carolina (26-4, 13-2 ACC) holding a decisive advantage on all counts.
With the victory, North Carolina set up a showdown with Duke (also 13-2 in conference play) on Saturday at Cameron Indoor Stadium for the ACC's regular season title.
Maryland (16-13, 6-9) will finish Mark Turgeon's first season with a 1-8 record on the road. And Sunday's finale against Virginia at Comcast Center may prove a challenge for Sean Mosley, whom Terrapins fans will honor at their own senior day, after Mosley injured an ankle during the first half Wednesday. He played on, managing four points on 1-for-9 shooting, despite obvious pain.
Freshman Nick Faust led the Terps with a career-high 17 points. Junior James Padgett recorded 13 points and 13 rebounds.
But after cutting a 13-point deficit to six early in the second half, Maryland fell hopelessly behind as North Carolina surged to a 21-2 run, taking advantage of the Terps' foul trouble and obvious fatigue.
"I'm not making excuses tonight, but we got tired," Turgeon said afterward, noting that Mychal Parker played despite strep throat and Mosley refused to come out of the game after suffering the ankle injury on an awkward landing following a block.
"Give [North Carolina] a lot of credit," Turgeon added. "Especially at about the 14-minute mark to the eight[-minute mark], they were at another level."
That's the stretch in which the mounting fouls caught up to the Terps' big men.
North Carolina led 36-25 at the break, with Zeller and Henson combining for 25 of the Tar Heels' first-half points.
"You get by one, and there's the other one," Turgeon said of guarding the Heels' twin towers. "They can both score so well; they can both pass well. . . . They're also both pretty smart basketball players."
A poor shooting stretch by North Carolina to start the second half gave Maryland an opening. The Terps pulled within six, 36-30, with Faust striking from long range.
But Maryland turned over the ball on back-to-back possessions. And sophomore Terrell Stoglin's shot wasn't falling consistently enough to help Maryland climb out of the hole, with the ACC's leading scorer ending up with 16 points on 4-for-18 shooting. 
Alex Len and Ashton Pankey, alternately tasked with stifling Zeller, committed their third and fourth fouls, respectively, with more than 16 minutes to play. It was a 10-point game at that point, Maryland trailing 42-32.
So the job fell to 6-10 Berend Weijs, who picked up his fourth with 12 minutes 2 seconds to play.
With a dunk by Henson, North Carolina led 58-42. Pankey fouled out three seconds later.
Suddenly, Turgeon was calling a timeout to stem a 17-2 North Carolina run, the Heels' leading 65-42. The deficit worsened. The fouls mounted. Turgeon sent out former walk-on John Auslander to help slow the Tar Heels' front court. And Len fouled out with 7:37 remaining.
The loss was far more decisive than the teams' Feb. 4 meeting, in which Maryland led at the half before falling, 83-74. That was before the Terps lost starting point guard Pe'Shon Howard for the season to a knee injury. And the profound impact was reflected in Wednesday's ball-handling statistics.
North Carolina, which boasts an outstanding point guard in Kendall Marshall, finished with 18 assists to seven turnovers. Maryland had eight assists to 17 turnovers.

Eagles roll into Patriot semis

BYLINE: Kathy Orton

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. D03

LENGTH: 710 words

American had plenty in its favor heading into its Patriot League men's basketball tournament quarterfinal game against Army. Not only were the Eagles 23-3 overall against the Black Knights, including 13-0 at Bender Arena, but they also had never lost in the quarterfinal round of the league tournament. 
None of those streaks were in jeopardy Wednesday night as third-seeded American had little trouble dispatching scoring-challenged Army, 57-40.  
The Eagles (20-10), who advance to play No. 2 Lehigh in Saturday's 2 p.m. semifinal, caused the third-best scoring offense in the league untold misery. For a time, the sixth-seeded Black Knights (12-18) threatened to break the tournament quarterfinal record for scoring futility of 34 points set by Lafayette in 2005. 
"For such an ugly game, it was beautiful for us," said American Coach Jeff Jones who recorded his fourth 20-win season in the past five years. 
Army struggled putting the ball in the basket from the tipoff. The Black Knights missed their first six shots and went without a point more than 5ֲ½ minutes into the game. They made only four field goals in the first 20 minutes. 
American, which ranks in the top 10 nationally in three-point field goal percentage, opened the game shooting the ball well from the outside. The Eagles made their first three field goals from behind the arc and went more than eight minutes into the game before they made a two-point field goal. 
But after Troy Brewer sank the first shot inside the arc for the Eagles, American fell victim to the same scoring woes as Army. They didn't score another point for nearly 4ֲ½ minutes as the Black Knights cut the Eagles' lead to 11-9. 
Daniel Munoz finally ended the drought with a three-pointer and Army never got that close again as the Black Knights suffered through a 13-minute scoring drought that spanned the first and second halves. 
"That's the one thing Coach Jones stresses from the day we walk in, first day in October, to end of the season is defense, defense, defense," Munoz said. 
Army concentrated its defensive efforts on stopping Charles Hinkle, a first-team all-league selection and the Patriot League's second-leading scorer. Although Hinkle finished with nine points - half his  average for the season - he did other things to help his team win. He had three assists and a team-high nine rebounds. 
"The way they were playing me I knew I wasn't going to score a lot of points," Hinkle said. "I tried to help the team the best way I could." 
Jones was pleased with how other players stepped up to fill the void left by Hinkle. Even though Munoz (11 points) was the only player to score in double figures, everyone who played contributed to the win. 
"At times, I think we've been able to do that this year," Jones said of his team's balanced scoring. "I don't know I've seen [the scoring] as spread out as this is . . . everybody just chipping in just a little bit. At this time of the year, you've just got to survive and advance and we're real happy to have a chance to play again on Saturday."

lBUCKNELL 87, NAVY 63: Joe Willman scored 18 points and the top-seeded Bison shot 62.7 percent from the field in the Patriot League quarterfinals in Lewisburg, Pa.
Bucknell (23-8), the defending tournament champion, made 32 of 51 shots to hand the eighth-seeded Midshipmen (3-26) their 21st consecutive defeat. Bucknell will host No. 5 seed Lafayette in the semifinals Saturday.
lLA SALLE 60, GEORGE WASHINGTON 56: Jerrell Wright scored 15 points including nine straight to open the second half and the Explorers hung on at Smith Center. La Salle (19-11, 8-7 Atlantic 10 Conference), snapped a two-game losing streak. The Colonials are 10-19, 5-10.

GMU women fall
Despite three players in double figures, George Mason could not overcome a strong start by James Madison, falling to the Dukes, 66-54, at Patriot Center.
The Patriots finished the regular season at 14-15, 8-10 in the Colonial Athletic Association. The Dukes are 23-6, 14-4.
Amber Easter led George Mason with her seventh double-double this season (18 points,  15 rebounds). The Patriots are the No. 7 seed in the CAA tournament and face No. 10 Northeastern in the opening round March 8 at Show Place Arena in Upper Marlboro.

A great big debate

BYLINE: Eric Prisbell

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. D03

In the final week of the regular season, fans of college basketball's two all-time winningest programs are coalescing around their favorite big man in the intensifying two-way battle for national player of the year: Kentucky's Anthony Davis or Kansas's Thomas Robinson
If there were any doubts about the front-runners, the choice crystallized last weekend when Davis and Robinson authored two of the most memorable performances by any player this season, leading their teams to important victories over NCAA tournament-bound  opponents. 
Few expected the national player of the year race to unfold like this when Kentucky beat Kansas, 75-65, at Madison Square Garden on Nov. 15. Much of the preseason attention centered on the returning standouts who decided against turning pro, including Ohio State's Jared Sullinger, North Carolina's Harrison Barnes and Baylor's Perry Jones III.
But the 6-foot-10, 220-pound Davis, who could be the top pick in June's NBA draft, has led a star-studded and top-ranked Kentucky team to a near-perfect record - the lone loss coming on a buzzer-beater at Indiana on Dec. 10. The freshman ranks _blankfirst nationally in blocked shots (4.8 per game) and _blankis tied for eighth in field goal percentage (65.8 percent).
And Robinson, a Washington native, has collected 20 double-doubles during his junior season, leading a team with lukewarm preseason expectations to its eighth consecutive Big 12 title. The 6-10, 237-pound Robinson _blankranks second nationally in rebounds per game (11.8).
ESPN analyst Doug Gottlieb said on his radio show that the race boils down to "splitting hairs" between the better potential NBA player (Davis) and the player who is most valuable to his team (Robinson).
"My argument of why Thomas Robinson would be player of the year at this point is if you take him off of Kansas's team, I'm not sure they make the NCAA tournament," Gottlieb said. "If you take Davis off Kentucky, it's still a good team, still a top-25 team, and now they have a chance to win the championship."
In what will likely be his only season of college basketball, Davis has a chance to win national freshman of the year, defensive player of the year and player of the year awards. He broke Kentucky's single-season blocks record in just 19 games. He alone averages more blocks per game than all but 33 Division I teams. 
_blankIn Kentucky's 83-74 victory over Vanderbilt on Saturday, Davis scored a career-high 28 points, making 10 of 11 shots from the floor. The 91 percent single-game shooting percentage was the highest for a Kentucky player with at least 10 attempts since the 1994-95 season. Davis also added 11 rebounds and five blocks.
"He did whatever he wanted to do," Vanderbilt center Festus Ezeli said. 
"He was spectacular," Vanderbilt Coach Kevin Stallings said. "He's special. He is a different kind of player."
Kentucky's national title hopes have been bolstered by Davis's continued evolution as an offensive player. In his past 11 games, Davis has made 66 of 97 (68 percent) shots from the floor. Teammate Michael Kidd-Gilchrist said Davis has come "a long way" offensively and is now a "monster" when he gets the ball.
But his calling card remains his ability to alter the offensive mind-set of opponents, sometimes even when he does not block a shot. Earlier this season, Coach John Calipari compared him to Marcus Camby, a standout for Calipari at Massachusetts in the 1990s.
"He just changes the way you try to attack him and when you tell your guys to attack, it changes the way in which they do attack because they know he is lurking," Mississippi Coach Andy Kennedy said. "His length is incredible and he just makes a difference defensively."
As unlikely as he was to eclipse Davis's performance, Robinson came close later Saturday when he helped _blankrally the Jayhawks to an 87-86 overtime victory against Missouri in one of the season's most thrilling games. With 28 points and 12 rebounds, Robinson earned Big 12 player of the week honors for the fourth time this season.
Kansas stormed back from a 19-point deficit with the help of Robinson's three-point play late in regulation that tied the score. Robinson then sent the game into overtime after blocking guard Phil Pressey's shot, just one of the indelible images during a breakout and somewhat improbable season for Robinson. 
_blankRobinson's heart-wrenching personal journey has been well chronicled: He lost his grandmother and grandfather during a three-week span last season. Then, five days after his grandfather died, Robinson's mother, Lisa, died, leaving Robinson in charge of his 9-year-old sister, Jayla.
Eyeing a lucrative NBA career, Robinson spent most of the summer honing his skills and all of this season defying expectations. He evolved from a good player on a talent-laden team to a guaranteed all-American looking to carry his team deep into the NCAA tournament.
One person who is not surprised by his team's success is Robinson, who said _blankafter the Jayhawks beat Oklahoma State on Monday: "We knew what we had before we hit the floor [this season], before the whole world saw us. . . . Going out and proving ourselves against people was definitely a motivation for us. I think that had everything to do with it."
The perception of this year's Kansas team and, more specifically, of Robinson has changed. After Monday's game, Cowboys Coach Travis Ford said what the rest of the country has learned: "They have the best junior in the country."
The only question now is whether they have the best player in the country.

At film fest, mystery title is the big reveal

BYLINE: Mark Jenkins

SECTION: STYLE; Pg. C01

LENGTH: 1013 words

This year's D.C. International Film Festival features two world premieres, including a rare fiction feature from a local director. But the highlight may be a documentary whose title can't be announced in advance - and an appearance by the man who made it.
The movie, which screens Friday, the third day of the 14th annual DCIFF, is about a leading 1970s rock musician. Completed in 1974, it was directed by Les Blank, a 76-year-old maverick who exemplifies the American independent cinema. 
The subject and title of the movie, although fairly easy to search online, cannot be revealed ahead of time without potentially attracting a lawsuit, says the Florida-born Blank by phone from his California home.
DCIFF publicist Maria Datch confirms that if the film's identity is revealed before the screening - 9 p.m. at the fest's main venue, the Naval Heritage Center auditorium - it must be canceled.
Here's how Blank explains the film's complicated status: The subject had a falling out with the producer. The musician sued and eventually won ownership rights to the film.
"For reasons he never explained to me, he did not want the film shown as it was," Blank says.
Sensing possible trouble in making a film about a major rock musician, Blank says that he had a paragraph added to his contract giving him the right to show the film in a noncommercial setting if he was personally present. "So that's what I'm doing," he says.
On Thursday, the night before the mystery screening, Blank will appear at the Heritage Center to show excerpts from his films and discuss his career. Likely prospects for discussion include "Burden of Dreams," his 1982 account of Werner Herzog's battle to film "Fitzcarraldo" in the Brazilian jungle; 1969's "The Blues Accordin' to Lightnin' Hopkins," a portrait of the Texas musician; and "Garlic Is as Good as Ten Mothers," a 1980 paean to "the stinking rose," which is listed on the Library of Congress's National Film Registry.
Blank's most recent movie is 2007's "All in This Tea," which follows American boutique-tea marketer David Lee Hoffman to China, co-directed by Gina Leibrecht. Blank is known for his friendships and collaborations with other filmmakers, including Herzog, Errol Morris and Jean-Pierre Gorin. One of his most fruitful partnerships was with German-born American-music enthusiast Chris Strachwitz, the soundman and producer for Blank's 1976 "Chulas Fronteras," a study of Tex-Mex norteno music.
A longtime friend, filmmaker and former MIT professor Richard Leacock, is the subject of a documentary that Blank is laboring to finish. Leacock, who died last year, formed a company with another documentary pioneer, D.A. Pennebaker, that was supposed to distribute "Lightnin' Hopkins." That didn't quite happen, but Blank and Leacock remained friends. Blank traveled several times to France, where Leacock retired, to film him as he cooked and told stories.
That footage is the basis for a movie tentatively titled "How to Smell a Rose." "I just need a grant to pay my editor," Blank says, "and finally finish it off."
Another in-progress documentary is about Butch Anthony, a taciturn, self-taught artist in backwoods Alabama. Blank treasures eccentrics, which he concedes are becoming harder to find. "People are becoming more like one another," he says.
"I'm still fascinated if I can go someplace and be around people and cultures that are completely different."
That quest has taken Blank through various folk-music subcultures, including blues, Cajun, Creole, Tex-Mex, polka and Hawaiian. His abiding interest in music makes him a natural participant in the DCIFF, which slots local band performances into its screening schedule. "Music is part of film," says Deirdre Evans-Pritchard, who's in her first year as DCIFF's executive director.
In the spirit of such festivals as Slamdance and South by Southwest, DCIFF doesn't aspire to become an industry event. "We are audience-driven, because we would die if we weren't," Evans-Pritchard says. "But our mission is the filmmaker."
Among the fest's 47 films are world premieres of "The Bright Side of the Moon," a psychological thriller by Farhad Alizadeh Ahi, an Iranian director based in Canada; and "Ultrasonic," a black-and-white film about a possible government mind-control experiment, directed by Silver Spring native Rohit Colin Rao. Evans-Pritchard calls the first film "lyrical" and notes about the second that it "doesn't often happen that Washington, D.C., produces a fiction feature film that's worthy of a public audience."
The DCIFF also will present the East Coast debut of "Who Bombed Judi Barry," a documentary about the 1990 car bombing that injured the Earth First activist. The film was produced by Darryl Cherney, who survived the explosion.
One of the bigger spectacles may be the crowd for "Patriot Guard Riders," a documentary about motorcyclists who attempt to shield grieving military families from funeral picketers representing the controversial Westboro Baptist Church. (These protesters blame American service members for the country's growing acceptance of gays and lesbians.)
Some of the Patriot Guard Riders "will be coming down on their bikes," Evans-Pritchard says. "How many, we are not clear. However, I have received several e-mails asking, 'Where do I park my Harley-Davidson?'ג[#x20ac][#x160]"
Other sorts of questions will be posed at the fest's seminars and workshops, including Thursday's "Summit on the Hill" to discuss piracy and financing possibilities, hosted by Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.), and, of course, at Blank's appearances at the screenings of his work Thursday and Friday, and his "master class" Saturday.
Asked what he tells aspiring filmmakers, Blank's reply has nothing to do with HD cams, shooting ratios or editing-room strategies. "Basically, just follow your enthusiasms. If you have the desire to do it, go do it. If you don't know how, go find out how," he says. "And do it now before it fades away. You don't have this energy forever.
"As Werner Herzog would say, all you need is guts," Blank says.

l A Feb. 28 A-section article about Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum's statements on higher education incorrectly said that less than 30 percent of the U.S. population over 25 years old has a college degree. The statistic applies to those 25 and older, and the proportion rose to just over 30 percent in 2011, according to the Census Bureau, which released the new numbers last week. 
l A Capital Weather Gang item in the Feb. 28 Metro section, in quoting the late American humorist Frank McKinney "Kin" Hubbard, incorrectly referred to him as Kim Hubbard.
l A Feb. 28 Style television review of PBS's "The Amish" incorrectly said that a gunman killed 10 girls in an Amish school in 2006. Ten girls were shot; five of them died.
l In the Ask Tom feature in the Jan. 8 Magazine, Tom Sietsema quoted culinary authors Karen Page and Andrew Dornenburg, who said a server who receives a 20 percent tip will net only a 17 percent tip if the restaurant deducts a 3 percent credit card fee. In fact, the server would lose 3 percent of 20 percent, which is 0.6 percent, and would receive a 19.4 percent tip.

Abortion bill hurt McDonnell's V.P. prospects

BYLINE: Robert McCartney

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B01

LENGTH: 763 words

When Virginia Gov. Robert F. McDonnell (R) asked antiabortion zealotsin the General Assembly last week to soften the controversial ultrasound bill, he faced a dilemma in explaining his move: Shall I appear ill-informed or weak-willed? 
McDonnell chose the former. He says he just didn't realize the measure he had been broadly supportingwould require many women desiring to end a pregnancy to undergo a particularly invasive ultrasound in which a probe is inserted in the vagina.  
Because of McDonnell's intervention, the bill soon headed for his signaturewould require only an abdominal ultrasound, performed outside the belly. That's still an outrageous violation of women's rights, for abortion defenders (like me). But abortion opponents view it as a disappointing compromise. 
I'm skeptical that the governor's explanation is the whole story. I agree with the hard-core social conservatives who said he had "suddenly gone squishy," as one bloggerwrote, when faced with an outpouring of opposition. That included having the law (and by extension, the state) become a punch line for  late-night comedians.
Still, I credit McDonnell with being true to the political profile he presented to Virginia voters when he won a landslide victory in 2009. He's consistently called himself a "pro-life" Republican but one who didn't want to emphasize social issues. 
By acting to temper the bill, while still promising to sign it, McDonnell honored both halves of that promise. He also signaled his dislike of an even more far-reaching antiabortion proposal, to confer "personhood" rights on a fetus. The bill died in the Virginia Senate. 
Unfortunately for McDonnell, the nuances of his position drowned quickly in the raging ideological whirlpool that is abortion politics, particularly at the national level. 
It doesn't matter to the Democratic Party - much less MSNBC commentators or "Saturday Night Live" satirists - that McDonnell repeatedly urged GOP legislators not to "overreach" on social issues. They don't care that he's been emphasizing, every chance he gets, that his priorities are economic development and other "kitchen table" topics. 
From the left's perspective, what matters is that McDonnell is preparing to sign the second bill in a year designed to restrict and regulate abortions. The earlier one raised building standards for clinics that perform abortions. 
As a result of the uproar, he has probably sacrificed whatever chance he had of being picked as the GOP vice presidential nominee this year, said a wide range of political analysts, including Republicans sympathetic to the governor. 
Assuming that the Republican presidential candidate is Mitt Romney, it would be much harder for him now to tap McDonnell as a running mate. The two of them would immediately have to devote time to defending the ultrasound bill, in addition to McDonnell's controversial 1989 master's thesissaying, among other things, that working mothers hurt families. 
"I think the moment in the sun is over," said a Republican source, who spoke on condition of anonymity to speak candidly about the governor's prospects. 
The ultrasound controversy "was probably very unhelpful to the calculus that Romney will make at the convention. Together with the thesis, this creates a second object of ridicule," the source said. 
The other big risk to McDonnell is that hard-core conservatives in the General Assembly are hijacking his three-year effort to rebrand the Virginia Republican Party as one devoted to "results-oriented conservatism" rather than polarizing social issues.
McDonnell didn't help his own cause when he signed a billto repeal a longtime law limiting firearms buyers to one handgun a month- which he supported when it originally passed. 
"McDonnell has done what he could to try to tamp down the social issues. But still, the number of bills on so many fronts is so high, I think it's going to be a tough sell for him to say, 'I moderated the crazy,' " Del. Robert H. Brink (D-Arlington) said. 
Republicans aren't the only ones in Richmond who risk overreaching. The Senate Democrats' move Wednesday to block approval of the budget could alienate the public, too.
But the GOP is dominant now, and it's pushing harder than before on issues that its own leader wants to de-emphasize.
If Democrats win Virginia in November as a result, with both the White House and U.S. Senate in play, the Republicans might wish they had better heeded McDonnell's counsel.

City panel approves revisions to gun law

BYLINE: Tim Craig

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B03

LENGTH: 622 words

A D.C. Council committee agreed Wednesday to roll back some city rules for possessing a firearm in the District, including eliminating a vision test, a five-hour training course, ballistics testing and a ban on some types of ammunition. 
But the bill, which comes as the city is still assimilating the 2008  Supreme Court decision that struck down a ban on owning a handgun, faces an uncertain future when it comes up for debate before the full council this month.  
Council member Phil Mendelson (D-At Large), chairman of the Judiciary Committee, pushed the bill through his committee Wednesday to try to reform city gun laws that are widely viewed as the toughest in the nation. 
The new rules are designed to insulate the city from lawsuits while streamlining rules that require residents who wish to keep a handgun at home to register their weapons with the city. 
In the landmark Heller v. District of Columbia,  the Supreme Court overturned the  District's three-decade-long handgun ban. The justices determined that the Second Amendment grants individuals the right to possess guns for self-defense, but that governments may impose reasonable restrictions.
After that ruling, the D.C. Council approved regulations that permit residents to register certain handguns once applicants pass a written examination and provide proof of residency and good vision. People are not allowed to carry guns outside their homes in the District. 
While the number of legal gun owners in the District remains small, the city continues to face court challenges and scrutiny over its gun laws. 
Earlier this year, the Washington Times published a series detailing a cumbersome set of regulations that often meant a months-long process for a resident to legally acquire a handgun in the District. 
Mendelson's bill does not change registration requirements, nor does it roll back laws stating that residents can register only one handgun per month. 
But the bill would eliminate the required vision test for applicants - although applicants will still have to provide documentation that they are not legally blind. 
 Mendelson is also proposing to scrap requirements that applicants complete a five-hour training course, including one hour on a gun range. Instead, the city's police chief can implement a "minimal" training requirement, such as requiring applicants to watch a safety video. 
 Although residents would be required to register their weapons with police, they would no longer have to submit their guns to police for ballistic identification before taking them home, according to the legislation. 
Under the current law, gun owners are required to submit to a background check every six years. The proposed bill removes that provision; residents,  however, would still need to renew their registration by mail, online or in person. 
Addressing strict city laws banning possession of ammunition, the bill clarifies that individuals with a legally registered gun can possess ammunition, even if it is "a caliber different from the firearm they registered," according to a council summary of the bill. 
 But the bill increases penalties for violating a city ban on "cop-killer bullets," according to a letter Mendelson sent to his colleagues. Such ammunition is capable of piercing the ballistic vests used by police officers.
A spokesman for Mendelson said he hopes that D.C. Council Chairman Kwame R. Brown (D) will hold an initial vote Tuesday. But Mendelson's advisers caution that they have no assurances that it will be pass unamended. 
A majority of council members are on record as being skeptical of lessening restrictions on guns, although many have stressed that they hope to fend off more court challenges to the city's law.

Arson ruling issued in Pr. George's probe

BYLINE: J. Freedom du Lacby J. Freedom du Lac

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B01

LENGTH: 567 words

A wind-fueled firethat ripped through a vacant Riverdale Heights house Friday night and injured seven firefighters - two of them critically - has been ruled arson, Prince George's County Fire Chief Marc S. Bashoor said Wednesday. 
"This cowardly crime is unconscionable to me," Bashoor said at a news conference. "I assure you that we will leave no stone unturned to bring anyone respon-sible for this to justice." 
Several agencies, including the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, are investigating the blaze, along with an unreported fire at a neighboring house at least two weeks earlier. 
Officials said the two fires appear related, but they released few details. 
Friday's blaze gutted a vacant housein the 6400 block of 57th Avenue, just east of Kenilworth Avenue. Flames had engulfed the basement when trucks from the Riverdale, Bladensburg and College Park fire departments arrived shortly after 9 p.m.
Seven firefighters entered through the front door, on the east side of the house. Strong winds out of the west were gusting up to 45 mph, and a blast of wind apparently entered the burning basement and sent a fireball up the stairs.
The firefighters on the first floor were engulfed by a blowtorch-like jet of flame, which shot out the front door, and all seven were burned. A group of firefighters in the basement escaped injury in what authorities described as a freak occurrence.
One of the injured firefighters, Ethan Sorrell, 21, suffered burns to his airways, and a breathing tube was inserted over the weekend. The tube has since been removed, and he was released from the hospital Tuesday, Bashoor said. 
"Had the tube not been put in, he would have died," he said. 
A second firefighter, Kevin O'Toole, 22, remained in critical but stable condition in the burn unit at Washington Hospital Center, where he is being treated for second- and third-degree burns over 50 percent of his body. He faces weeks of recovery and months of rehabilitation, authorities said.
"Arson is not a victimless crime," ATF Special Agent David Cheplak said.
Surrounded by fire and police officials and prosecutors from the Prince George's state's attorney's office, Bashoor said he had ordered three investigations into the incident.  One of them is a safety review to focus on the fireball that injured the seven firefighters and rattled the department. 
"I can't describe the significant emotional toll this has taken," Bashoor said, standing near Sorrell's scorched radio, which reeked of smoke, its knobs melted down to nubs. "I've seen grown men and women crying. It's been very difficult."
In investigating Friday's blaze at 6404 57th Ave., officials discovered that the house next door - at 6402 57th, also vacant - had received fire damage weeks earlier. "We do believe the two incidents are related," Prince George's Fire Marshal Scott Hoglander said. He declined to elaborate further.
Despite the fires in adjacent houses and less than a month apart, the ATF's Cheplak said he wasn't ready to declare that a serial arsonist might be on the loose. But, he said, "if somebody does it once, there's a chance it will be done again."
Officials asked for help with the investigation, urging anyone with information about either incident to call Crime Solvers at 866-411-8477.
"Somebody out there saw something," Hoglander said. "Your information is vital to our investigation."

Teen is wounded in Northeast shooting
A male teen was shot and wounded Wednesday afternoon in Northeast Washington, D.C. police said.
The victim approached a resident for help near 17th Street and Constitution Avenue just before 3:30 p.m. and said he had been shot, said Officer Paul Metcalf, a spokesman. The resident called police, who responded to the scene. The victim's age and condition were not immediately clear. Police were investigating where the shooting took place.

Officer didn't use radar gun on car
The Prince George's County police officer who pulled over a County Council member apparently driving more than 100 mphon the Capital Beltway did not give her a speeding ticket because he did not have enough time to gauge the pace of her sport-utility vehicle, authorities said Wednesday.
Prince George's Assistant Police Chief Kevin Davis said the officer, a 14-year veteran, did not use a radar gun to determine the speed at which freshman council member Karen R. Toles (D-Suitland) was driving before he pulled her over Feb. 22. The officer estimated how fast she was going based on the speed of his  cruiser as he raced to catch up with her, Davis said.
Law enforcement sources have said the officer's cruiser camera shows his vehicle traveling as fast as 108 mph and not gaining ground on the council member.  The officer eventually ticketed Toles for making an unsafe lane change and gave her a warning for speeding. The ticket carries a $90 fine.
"The officer did not have enough time and space . . .  to establish a pace of the car he pulled over," Davis said Wednesday. "Preliminarily, we don't believe that this police officer afforded anyone any special treatment."

Water utilities explore merger
Fairfax County's water wars could end with a marriage between the two parties most embroiled in conflict as Fairfax Water on Tuesday offered to work out a mutually agreeable merger with Falls Church's system.
The overture comes weeks after Falls Church publicly announced its interest in exploring all options, including a sale or merger, of the water utility it has operated since the 1930s.
In a six-page letter to Falls Church City Manager Wyatt Shields, Fairfax Water's general manager, Charles M. Murray, said the utility was interested in joining the two systems and invited both utilities to explore the matter further.

Creditors withdrawexaminer request
Creditors of former Virginia governor L. Douglas Wilder's proposed slavery museum withdrew their request Wednesday to appoint a financial examiner or convert the case to essentially liquidate the organization.
An attorney for the U.S. National Slavery Museum, Sandra Robinson, told a U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge that they had filed missing federal tax returns and had proposed a plan to begin fundraising again, anticipating donations of more than $900,000 within the first year. 
The museum, planned for nearly 20 years, was never built. The organization owes millions of dollars to an architectural firm, and to the city of Fredericksburg for unpaid real-estate taxes. 
The museum filed for bankruptcy this fall. 
The IRS recently revoked its federal tax-exempt status after the organization failed to file returns or notices for three consecutive years. 
Robinson and Wilder did not immediately return messages seeking comment. 
Jeffrey Scharf, an attorney for the city of Fredericksburg, said the city withdrew its motion to appoint an examiner because, with an accountant now submitting returns for the museum, it's premature. 
"The city could be back filing it again depending how the museum proceeds with reorganizing. . . . They've certainly got a lot to do to show that their plan is viable," he said.

Democrats kill last Va. budget

BYLINE: Laura Vozzella

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B06

LENGTH: 816 words

DATELINE: RICHMOND

RICHMOND - In a bid for more committee power and more state spending, Senate Democrats killed the only remaining state budget plan Wednesday, a move likely to heighten partisan rancor in the_blankGeneral Assembly and force a special session.
The $85 billion budget plan died in a partisan vote a week after the House had approved it. Democrats had already rejected the _blankSenate version.
It is possible for a new budget plan - from Gov. Robert F. McDonnell (R) or one brought forward by lawmakers - to pass before legislators adjourn March 10. But lawmakers said that seems highly unlikely and warned that a partial government shutdown could ultimately result. 
 Democrats "appear willing to jeopardize the timely payment of the salaries of our teachers and police officers, the services our senior citizens depend upon, the resources our universities need to operate, the budgets of local governments, the funding for our prisons and hospitals, and the entire state budget to gain more power," McDonnell said in a prepared statement. "They have put political goals of 20 individuals ahead of the collective policy needs of 8 million Virginians."
Republicans need to flip only one Senate Democrat to win passage. Earlier in the session, Democrats sometimes broke ranks to vote with Republicans on pro-gun and antiabortion legislation. But they've stuck together on the budget.
They said their resolve was only strengthened this week when Sen. Emmett W. Hanger Jr. (R-Augusta) threatened to cut $42 million in Northern Virginia school funding if Democrats killed the budget.
"We're not going to cave into blackmail," said Senate Minority Leader Richard L. Saslaw (D-Fairfax). "And you're not going to hold the students of Northern Virginia hostage over this."
But Republicans maintained that Democrats are the hostage-takers, bidding for more power in Richmond's upper chamber.
"The Senate Republicans are not going to be extorted over bruised political egos," said Senate Majority Leader Thomas K. Norment (R-James City).

Committee seats sought
Using the prospect of a deadlocked Senate as leverage, Democrats have been pressing Republicans to revamp some Senate committees, adding more Democrats to certain panels and restructuring the powerful Senate Finance Committee so that it is co-chaired by a Republican and a Democrat.
Republicans have refused and accused Democrats of trying to turn the budget process into a power grab. Democrats say they are only trying to correct a power grab pulled off by Republicans at the start of the session, when the GOP changed Senate rules and enlisted the tie-breaking votes of Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling (R) to help them stack crucial committees with Republicans.

Bolling's power limited
November's elections left the Senate evenly split, with 20 Republicans and 20 Democrats. Republicans claimed controlof the chamber because Bolling has the authority to break tie votes on some matters. Democrats, who disputed his authority, had sought a power-sharing deal.
Bolling does not have authority to vote on the budget. So when the General Assembly shifted its attention to the spending issues, Democrats suddenly had some power. Up to that point, they had been unable to stop a host of conservative bills, including much-mocked legislationthat, before it was softened last week, would have required women seeking an abortion to have an invasive ultrasound involving a vaginal probe.
"All the things that they're doing, and we're supposed to just sit back and relax?" Saslaw said. "When we were controlling things, we weren't the laughingstock of America."
Republicans have expressed exasperation that Democrats thumbed their noses at the budget after the Senate Finance Committee amended McDonnell's spending plan to add millions for schools, social services and other Democratic priorities.
"It takes 21 votes, so any single Democrat could show statesmanship and say, 'This is the budget that I would support,' " said Sen. Ryan McDougle (R-Hanover).

Not the first time
Richmond has seen its share of budget impasses. But in the other cases - in 2001, 2004 and 2006 - proposed budgets had at least passed the House and Senate. Differences between the two spending plans were in the process of being worked out in conference committees when the General Assembly adjourned.
This time around, there is no budget plan left on the table. If lawmakers fail to adopt a plan by July 1, a partial government shutdown is likely.
Democrats have pointed to specific budget items - and non-items - that they object to, including the fact that  no funds were set aside for the Dulles rail project. Saslaw also said that the budget does not provide money to pay for the ultrasounds that women will be required to get before abortions.
But it's the Democrats' request for more committee power that has received the most attention.

Saved 100 Jews from the Nazis in Amsterdam

BYLINE: Emily Langer

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B07

LENGTH: 879 words

Tina Strobos, a psychiatry student who joined the Dutch underground during World War II and helped save the lives of more than 100 Jews by giving them refuge on the upper floor of her Amsterdam rowhouse, died Feb. 27 at her home in Rye, N.Y.
She was 91 and had metastatic cancer, said her son Jur Strobos. 
In 1989, the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem recognized Dr. Strobos and her late mother, Marie Schotte, as "righteous among the nations" - people who, without seeking personal reward, risked their lives, freedom and safety to save persecuted Jews during World War II. 
To save one person "was an extraordinary feat," Donna Cohen, executive director of the Holocaust and Human Rights Education Center in White Plains, N.Y., said in an interview. Dr. Strobos, who saved dozens, was "the ultimate rescuer." 
Her story has been recounted in numerous volumes of Holocaust history. About 80 percent of the 140,000 Jewish residents of Holland during the Nazi occupation died in the Holocaust, according to Yad Vashem.
Among them was Anne Frank, the young German-born diarist who hid with her family in another Amsterdam attic just blocks away from Dr. Strobos's home. The Franks were betrayed by an informant and deported to concentration camps, where everyone in the family except Anne's father died. 
Dr. Strobos retained a lifelong regret about the fate of Anne Frank and her family,  whose hiding place lacked an escape route. "If I knew they were there," she told her son, "I would have gotten them out of the country." 
Dr. Strobos was just shy of her 20th birthday when Nazi Germany invaded the Netherlands in May 1940. When she and her university classmates refused to sign an oath of loyalty to Adolf Hitler, the medical school was shut down and many students, including Dr. Strobos, joined the underground resistance movement. 
In the beginning, she concentrated her efforts on arming and equipping the resistance fighters. She ran guns, explosives and radios, sometimes hiding them in her bicycle basket during journeys of 50 miles.
But as armed resistance became increasingly dangerous, she turned her efforts to helping her Jewish friends and, later, others seeking a way out of the country. One of the Jews she saved was her then-fiance, Abraham Pais, who became a celebrated physicist and biographer of Albert Einstein. They did not marry but had "ties that will never break," Pais once said.
Rescue efforts in the Netherlands were especially perilous, given the low-lying Dutch terrain, which offered few forests and no mountains for cover. Dr. Strobos and her mother turned their three-story home, which was just behind the Royal Palace of Amsterdam, into an initial stop on the underground railroad. They provided their guests with food and medical care as well as false passports to replace ones marking them as Jews. 
Obtaining fresh documents to falsify sometimes required creativity. Once, at the funeral of an aunt, Dr. Strobos rifled through mourners' coats. She enlisted the help of train-station pickpockets, who stole travelers' papers for the cause. 
"I wasn't alone in all this, you know," Dr. Strobos told the Westchester County Journal News in 2009. 
One day, a carpenter from the resistance showed up on her doorstep and offered his services. In the attic, he fashioned a wall that closed off a gable and created a hideaway for up to four people. The gable's window provided an escape route.
The wall was so skillfully made, Dr. Strobos's son said, that when he and his family returned to the Amsterdam house in the 1970s, they could not find the entrance to the hideaway without their mother's help.
Dr. Strobos said that she was arrested nine times and that her house was searched eight times. 
"I never believed in God," she once said, "but I believed in the sacredness of life." 
Tineke Buchter was born May 19, 1920, in Amsterdam. An only child, she grew up mostly with her mother after her parents divorced. Her grandmother had been involved with the labor movement of the late 1800s, and her mother, a socialist atheist, had housed refugees during World War I.
Dr. Strobos received a medical degree from the University of Amsterdam in 1946. Later, she studied in London under the direction of Anna Freud, the daughter of psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud, whose family had fled Austria to England during the Nazis' rise to power. 
Dr. Strobos immigrated to the United States in 1951, became a U.S. citizen and practiced psychiatry in New York until she was 89. Many of her clients, her son said, were indigent and handicapped.
Her first marriage, to Robert Strobos, a neurologist, ended in divorce. Her second husband, Walter A. Chudson, an economist, died in 2002 after 35 years of marriage. 
Survivors include three children from her first marriage, Semon Strobos of New Braunfels, Tex., Jur Strobos of Washington and Carolyn Strobos of Newport-on-Tay, Scotland; two stepchildren, Lucy Chudson of New York City and Paul Chudson of Mamaroneck, N.Y.; and nine grandchildren.
For years, Dr. Strobos once told an interviewer, she had forgotten many of the events that took place in her attic during the war. 
"I'm sure it was because I didn't want to remember all those things," she said. "So you just close the whole attic of your memory."

'Aspen Hill Rapist' gets 3 life terms as victims recall terror

BYLINE: Dan Morse

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A01

LENGTH: 936 words

The 50-year-old Olney woman stood up in court Thursday, 20 feet from the man prosecutors called the most notorious rapist Montgomery County has ever seen.
For 32 years, she said, close friends have known to not come up behind her. She described herself as easily intimidated and nervous - a far cry from the 18-year-old walking home from work in the summer of 1980. That's when the rapist grabbed her from behind, put a gun to her head and forced her into a darkened side yard.
"Mr. Buzbee has helped to kill off the person that I was supposed to be," she told a judge, her voice and hands shaking. "And I still wonder who that person might have been." 
Dubbed the "Aspen Hill Rapist," Timothy J. Buzbee rained terror on Montgomery three decades ago, attacking women as young as 15 in what police said was a string of at least 11 rapes. He broke into homes. He lurked along shadowy sidewalks. He posed as a jogger while looking for victims. Buzbee was captured in 1982, was later convicted and has been behind bars ever since.
On Thursday, Buzbee was back in court to be punished for three more rapes in Montgomery, dating to 1977. DNA linked Buzbee to the long-unsolved crimes in 2009, and prosecutors went after him, knowing there was a chance he could someday be released on parole. Hoping to secure additional prison time, they asked four victims - ages 50 to 58 - to come to court to tell the judge how the attacks changed their lives.
The women met for the first time Thursday morning, about an hour before the hearing was to start in Montgomery Circuit Court.
Three came from the Washington region - the Olney woman, a 58-year-old tax lawyer who lives in the District and a 56-year-old from Rockville. They gathered in a conference room, they would recall, as a prosecutor led them through the proceeding ahead. Buzbee had pleaded guilty days earlier to three of the rapes. 
Then the fourth woman arrived, dropped off by a detective who had picked her up at her hotel lobby. "You're the one from California," one of the trio said warmly as the 52-year-old physical therapist walked in.
By 11 a.m., the four had made their way up to the courtroom. Joined by two friends, the six sat together, close enough to touch a shoulder, whisper words of encouragement.
Buzbee, wearing blue jeans and a denim shirt, came in. He showed no emotion, sat down at a table and folded his hands.
His attorney, Brian Shefferman, said Buzbee has been an exceptional inmate while earning college degrees behind bars and working in a prison print shop. Shefferman urged Judge Nelson Rupp to allow the parole board to one day do its job and consider whether to release Buzbee.
Then the victims rose to speak.
"I want to unequivocally state that what the defendant did to me and women in Montgomery County - in his teens and continued until he was caught in this 20s - was indescribably evil," the tax lawyer said.
About 7:35 p.m. on April 14, 1977, the woman, who was then 23, was walking home when Buzbee jogged by, turned around and attacked from behind. He covered her mouth, pushed her beside a house, took off his shirt and wrapped it around her head. He threatened her with a knife, raped her, stole $20 and fled. The woman ran to a nearby house and at the time thought she was calm.
"I didn't realize I had been banging on the door and that when she answered, I was disheveled, crying and covered in grass and dirt," the tax lawyer said.
As the years went by, she said, she kept the attack secret from colleagues, even family members. 
"For years after the rape, it would paralyze me and make me hyperventilate and feel faint if a stranger in the street came up behind me too close," she said. 
The physical therapist spoke next, touching her new friend on the shoulder as she walked past. She looked directly at the rapist, recalling the attack 34 years ago, shortly after ending her summer job shift. "Mr. Buzbee, I'm the 18-year-old lifeguard that you raped. I probably smelled like chlorine," she said.
During the attack, he took off her glasses, and her vision was so bad that she couldn't see more than a foot in front of her. She knew he had a gun but couldn't tell what he was doing with it. For 15 years, she said, she was terrified of the dark. "Thankfully," she told the judge, "that extreme fear has subsided to a rational level of concern and care."
The victim from Rockville gave the briefest remarks but was powerful nonetheless. She'd been walking home from a dance class in Wheaton when Buzbee attacked. She, too, became afraid of the dark and was easily startled when someone approached from behind. "I had to accept that a horrible crime was committed against me," she said, "and live one day at at time."
Prosecutor John Maloney told Rupp that the fear Buzbee caused was similar to that of the Capital Beltway snipers years later.
"This guy terrorized the community in the 1980s. And we find out [from the DNA] he had been doing it for much longer," Maloney said. "None of us want to take the risk of him getting out and doing anything. I honestly believe he is the most prolific rapist in Montgomery County history and probably the state of Maryland."
Buzbee stood in court and said he is sorry and thinks every day of the pain he's caused.
"There's nothing that can justify my actions," he said. "There's nothing I can say to these victims that's going to make them feel better. I just hope that through the years and through the grace of God they've gotten through the pain somehow. I don't suspect they will."
Rupp sentenced him to three life terms.

Dave Sharrett Sr. unsatisfied by meeting with Army Secretary John McHugh

The father of a Fairfax County soldier killed in a friendly fire incident in Iraq said he got no answers from Secretary of the Army John McHugh.

No official answersfor slain soldier's dad 
The father of an Army soldier from Oakton, killed by his own lieutenant in Iraq during a friendly fire combat incident, met with the secretary of the Army on Thursday and came away dissatisfied and unsure whether he would continue to seek answers and accountability after four years. 
Pfc. David H. Sharrett II, 27, died near Balad, Iraq, in January 2008. His family was told that Sharrett was a victim of fratricide. But they were not initially told that 1st Lt. Timothy R. Hanson hadn't informed anyone of the shooting or that he  fled the battlefield unwounded a short time later without assisting in the search for Sharrett.  The Army also did not disclose that there were numerous overhead video recordingsof the battle.
When the soldier's father, former Fairfax County school teacher David H. Sharrett Sr., uncovered Hanson's actions, then realized that Hanson's commanders knew of his actions and had not disciplined him, he began pursuing full truth and accountability. Meanwhile, Hanson was promoted to captain.
A third Army investigation of the entire incident, released in the summer of 2011, finally criticized Hanson's post-battle actions harshly but did not disclose what measures, if any, the Army had taken against him. On Thursday, Dave Sharrett Sr., his wife and youngest son all met with Army Secretary John McHugh for 45 minutes to ask what was being done to Hanson and his immediate superiors, Maj. Michael Loveall and Lt. Col. Robert McCarthy.
They were told that Hanson still works for the Army and that Loveall and McCarthy will not be held responsible for ignoring Hanson's actions, Sharrett said.
He said McHugh told him that "there wasn't any clear evidence they could use in a criminal investigation to hold them accountable."
McHugh apologized for the Army's failure to disclose the full circumstances of the firefight on Jan. 16, 2008, and its aftermath, according to Sharrett.
With the help of other soldiers, a New York Daily News reporter and a father of another fallen soldier, Sharrett Sr. obtained overhead videos that showed Hanson fleeing the battlefield on a helicopter at 6:05 a.m. while Sharrett lay bleeding in the dark until he was found at 6:35 a.m. and flown out at 6:50 a.m. He was pronounced dead at 7:50 a.m.
Although an Army general told The Washington Post in January that Hanson was no longer in the Army, McHugh said he was still "being paid by the Army," Sharrett said.
Army spokesman George Wright said the Sharretts' meeting with McHugh was "a private conversation" and he could not discuss details of what was said.
"It was more of the Army choosing not to address the really hard questions of what happened," Sharrett said. Now, he said, he was considering leaving the story to the news media "to pick up the ball where I have chosen to put it down. And I need to do that for my family."

'East Coast Rapist' case goes to grand jury in Va.

BYLINE: Josh White

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B05

LENGTH: 874 words

It started to rain that Halloween night, and the three teenage girls decided to head home. As they walked near a Woodbridge shopping center with their bags of candy, they texted, talked on the phone, laughed. Suddenly, they sensed someone behind them in the dark.
"I felt like a gun on my back," one testified. "He said: 'Don't move. Do you have any money, do you have anything?' We said we didn't have anything but our bags of candy. That's when he directed us behind the building." 
It was the beginning of a terrifying ordeal and what authorities think were the last two in a decades-long series of rapes spanning the East Coast. In a Prince William County courtroom Thursday, the young women for the first time confronted the man police allege raped two of them in 2009, describing in detail how they were accosted, led into the woods and brutally attacked on a night that was supposed to be about childhood fun.
Aaron H. Thomas, 40, did not look at the women as they testified, staring at the table in front of him and at one point putting his forehead on it. He is, police say, the elusive "East Coast Rapist," linked by DNA to nearly a dozen rapes in Virginia, Maryland and Connecticut dating to the 1990s.
Thomas, bearded and wearing an orange jumpsuit and waist chains, appeared in court for a preliminary hearing, the start of a process that could result in a trial at which he could face a maximum of life in prison. Juvenile and Domestic Relations Judge William Alan Becker sent the case to a grand jury for possible indictment.
Speaking with poise and clarity, the young women recounted a night that began with a 7-year-old's party, taking a group of youngsters out trick-or-treating and then following suit when they saw how much candy they might be able to collect. On the way home, it started to rain.
"But we didn't make it back," one of the teenagers testified.
Instead, they were forced to drop their bags of candy at a wood line and walk down a steep slope. At the bottom, they were ordered to face away from the man and then lie on the ground.
"Don't say anything or I'll kill you," he said, according to testimony.
He then raped two of the girls. The Washington Post generally does not identify victims of sex crimes.
"I was scared," said one victim. "I was praying. I thought that was it. I thought I was going to die."
The third teenager, who was cowering in the wet leaves, said she knew her friends were being raped but wasn't able to see it.
It was her, though, who probably interrupted the attack through her deft attempts to call for help. Having hidden her cellphone in her sleeve, she texted her mother and others that her friends were being raped, at one point reaching a 911 operator while fearing that the man would discover what she was doing. When police sirens approached, the man ran.
Assistant Commonwealth's Attorney James Willett told the court that the third teenager would have been attacked had police not arrived. "He just didn't have time to do it," Willett said.
On cross examination, defense attorneys Ronald Fahy and Jennifer Zary were able to establish that none of the teenagers could identify Thomas as their attacker, because they knew only that the rapist was wearing a dark hoodie, a ski mask and dark jeans. And none could say for sure that the man had a gun, just that they believed he did.
Thomas did not speak during the hearing, and prosecutors presented a doctor's report indicating that he is competent to stand trial. His mother attended part of the hearing, but left during the first teenager's testimony.
Police and prosecutors said the Halloween attack was one in a series of at least 17 and that it carried several hallmarks of Thomas's alleged crimes. It involved approaching vulnerable strangers with a weapon; the rapes took place in a secluded area likely known to the rapist; and he was able to escape without witnesses noticing much about him. Perhaps most important, however, Thomas's DNA was left at the scene, police said
For years, police knew they were looking for one man in connection with rapes in Prince George's, Fairfax and Loudoun counties and in New Haven, Conn., having found the same DNA at many of the scenes. After the Halloween rapes, The Post published a lengthy investigation and a police task force aggressively distributed sketches of the attacker and offered a reward.
Thomas, a long-haul trucker who grew up in Prince George's County, at one point owned a home in Woodbridge not far from the scene of the rapes.
After Thomas's name was culled from a computer program as a potential suspect - and after an anonymous tip - police collected a DNA sample from a cigarette he discarded and quickly arrested him when it was a match.
Prince William County police 1st Sgt. Liam Burke told the court that Thomas brought up the Halloween rapes on his own when he talked to detectives.
"He knew he was there for Halloween night," Burke said. "He said he saw the girls walking, got an urge, had a fake gun and brought them into the woods and sexually assaulted them."
Commonwealth's Attorney Paul B. Ebert said he expects the case will go before a grand jury in April. If convicted, Thomas could face life in prison on charges of rape, abduction and use of a weapon.

Woman, 70, hadgun in carry-on bag
A 70-year-old woman has been charged with having a gun in her carry-on luggage at Baltimore-Washington International Marshall Airport.
Maryland Transportation Authority Police Sgt. Kirk Perez said the .38-caliber gun was found just before 9 a.m. Wednesday as the woman was going through airport security. 
Perez said Jane Hoover of Glen Burnie apparently stored the weapon in the bag and forgot that it was there. Perez said Hoover was arrested but later released and was cooperative with police.
Hoover will have to go to court to face the charge, Perez said. The weapon was confiscated.

Street sweeping. restrictions return
Residential street sweeping and parking restrictions returned to the District on Thursday. The season will last through Oct. 31, according to the Department of Public Works.
Posted signs identify the days and hours when parking restrictions are in effect to allow sweepers full access to the streets. Enforcement of these restrictions won't begin until March 12.
Any residential streets without parking restriction signs are swept twice a month, as opposed to every week; cars don't need to be moved on these streets.

Man, 28, convicted in shooting death
A District man was convicted Thursday of first-degree premeditated murder and related charges in D.C. Superior Court after shooting a man in the back after a dice game, authorities said.
Rickey Pharr, 28, then attempted to cover up the killing of Angelo Jones, 31, according to the U.S. attorney's office. Pharr was also convicted of obstruction of justice.
Prosecutors said Pharr killed Jones in October 2010 after the two fought in the 5300 block of Dix Street NE. Jones accused Pharr of being a government informant during a dice game, calling him "hot," which spurred the fight, authorities said.
Pharr left the fight and then returned with a gun and shot Jones six times in the back, authorities said. He later asked his friends to provide false alibis to his lawyers and police, according to prosecutors.
Pharr faces a minimum of 35 years in prison. He is scheduled to be sentenced April 27.

EV charging stations available at Dulles  
Four electric charging stations opened Wednesday at Dulles International Airport with room to charge eight vehicles.
The stations are part of a pilot program, so there is no extra cost to use them through 2013. Regular parking fees still apply.
Another four stations are being installed at Reagan National Airport, according to the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, which operates Dulles and National. They are expected to be in service soon.
Eight charging stations were added to Baltimore-Washington International Marshall Airport last year.
Each station at Dulles has two types of chargers: Level 1, a 120-volt outlet, and Level 2, a 240-volt connector. You can see whether a station is available or activate a station with the ChargePoint app (available for iPhone, Android and BlackBerry devices).
The Dulles stations, which are reserved for electric vehicles, are in Daily Parking Garage No. 2 on Level 3. A map of their location can be found under parking information at www.mwaa.com/dulles.

Suspect in Ohio school shooting charged with murder

DATELINE: CHARDON, OHIO

CHARDON, Ohio - Prosecutors on Thursday charged a 17-year-old with murder in a school shooting rampage that claimed three students' lives.
T.J. Lane will have a hearing next week before a juvenile court judge in Geauga County to determine whether he will be charged as an adult. As a juvenile, he is not eligible for the death penalty. 
Prosecutors have said that Lane, who attended a school for at-risk students, confessed to randomly firing on a group of students at Chardon High School in Chardon on Monday morning, but his motive is unclear. Two students were wounded, and a third was grazed in the ear by a bullet.
Frank Hall, an assistant football coach whom police credited with chasing Lane out of the school after the shootings, spoke publicly about the shootings for the first time Thursday.
"I don't know why this happened. I only wish I could have done more. I'm not a hero. I'm a football coach and a study-hall teacher. Law enforcement, first responders . . . they are the heroes," Hall said, his voice choked with emotion.
Authorities said classes will resume Friday. 
About 50 Chardon students gathered Thursday in the city's downtown, where they held hands and sang the school song around a pavilion decorated with red ribbons, candles, flowers and stuffed animals.
The crowd soon swelled to about 1,000, and the group walked past flags flying at half-staff to the school, where Superintendent Joe Bergant hugged every student who entered. Grief counselors were on hand to speak with them.
"This is a defining moment for us," said an 18-year-old student named Brandon who would not give his last name. He said he was mostly worried about reentering the school cafeteria, where the shootings occurred.
Lane has told police that he took a .22-caliber Ruger pistol and a knife to the school on Monday and randomly fired 10 shots into a group of students sitting at a table, according to prosecutors.
Daniel Parmertor, 16, Demetrius Hewlin, 16, and Russell King, 17, were killed. Nick Walczak, 17, remains in serious condition in a hospital with neck and back injuries, and another student has been released from the hospital.
Lane was charged with three counts of aggravated murder, two counts of aggravated attempted murder and one count of felonious assault.

The home as a castle can be a mirage

BYLINE: Ann Hornaday

SECTION: STYLE; Pg. C01

LENGTH: 1066 words

"Here it is, guys. Our very own castle."
Those offhanded but pointedly fateful words are spoken by John C. Reilly in "We Need to Talk About Kevin," Lynne Ramsay's bold, unnerving adaptation of Lionel Shriver's 2003 novel.
Reilly plays Franklin, a good-natured husband and father who is showing his wife Eva (Tilda Swinton) and their young son Kevin (Jasper Newell) a sprawling new house he has purchased in the suburbs. Eva, a free spirit and committed Manhattanite, is discomfited by the sterile, too-perfect pseudo-mansion, which never loses the polished gleam of a stage set. True to her misgivings, carnage both metaphorical and literal will ensue in the wake of the family's rustication - most of it hidden behind the house's clipped greensward of a lawn, at least until it reaches a point of explosive, tragic critical mass. 
Although "We Need to Talk About Kevin" focuses on Eva's story - given steely life by Swinton's haunted, uncompromising performance - it's Franklin's words about the castle that have taken on new meaning over the past few days, first when news broke about a fatal high school shooting in Chardon, Ohio, and then while watching a documentary called "Undefeated."
Anyone familiar with the plot of Shriver's novel recognizes the eerie coincidence of "We Need to Talk About Kevin" opening just days after the Ohio shooting, which claimed three lives and for which a 17-year-old student named T.J. Lane has been charged. But fans of the book know that Shriver's rigorous, lucid, searingly perceptive story is about school violence the same way "Moby Dick" is about fishing. As Ramsay's graphic, almost abstract adaptation makes clear, Eva's story - which pivots around her failure to bond with Kevin as an infant - becomes inevitably tangled up in ambivalence, shame and self-deception.
It's precisely that sense of self-deception that Franklin embodies when he buys the family "castle," in the hopes that the signs of trouble that Kevin has been evincing as a child - the lack of empathy, the manipulativeness, the almost pathological defiance - are simply symptoms of cramped New York life. Like so many jaded urban dwellers, he's convinced that once he, Eva and Kevin decamp for more bucolic climes, their hard-wired natures will follow suit.
Instead, the cavernous, light-filled house where most of the psychic warfare takes place in "We Need to Talk About Kevin" becomes a looming symbol of Eva's isolation. And her aloneness begins to assume the contours of quiet desperation as she tries in vain to get Franklin to acknowledge the emotional problems bedevilling Kevin, played as a creepy, cold-eyed teenager by Ezra Miller. With no neighbors nearby or friends, Eva is almost completely on her own throughout the movie, which grows in its sense of dread as Eva fights a futile battle to have her reality validated.
The picture of Eva's solitary suffering was what came back so strongly as details of the Ohio shooting emerged, especially regarding T.J. Lane's life with his grandparents. By all accounts, Lane enjoyed a warm and loving home with the elderly couple. But their family occasionally veered into crisis, with the couple sometimes calling the police to help them with T.J.'s troubled older brother. If filmgoers watch "We Need to Talk About Kevin" through the lens of this past week's news, they might find themselves reflecting on whether anyone can ever know what's going on behind neatly painted doors and manicured lawns.
That same question is posed - and answered far more encouragingly - in "Undefeated," which arrives in Washington fresh from winning the documentary Oscar on Sunday. Dan Lindsay and T.J. Martin's stirring, emotional portrait of a high school football team in the impoverished neighborhood of North Memphis, Tenn., obeys all the governing conventions of such a tale, with ragtag underdogs known as the Manassas Tigers overcoming broken homes, poverty, injuries and personal demons to make a "Moneyball"-esque run at the playoffs.
In yet another coincidence, "Undefeated" also features the exact same kind of big, neatly kept, carefully maintained suburban homes that Eva inhabits in "We Need to Talk About Kevin," the kind of real-estate status symbols ungenerous critics might call McMansions. But in "Undefeated," these citadels of middle class security and safety don't hide the lives of troubled teens. Instead, they're thrown open to create a space of compassion, trust and community.
Volunteer football coach Bill Courtney - a prosperous businessman who sacrifices his relationship with his own kids to coach the fighting, scrapping, swearing, occasionally incarcerated members of the Tigers - routinely leaves the comfort of his house to alternately comfort and berate his players in their blighted neighborhoods. In the film's most affecting story line, assistant coach Mike Ray welcomes a gentle giant of a linebacker named O.C. to spend three nights a week at Ray's well-appointed home so the football player can receive tutoring - and perhaps qualify for a college scholarship. (Unlike "The Blind Side," which hews to an unfortunately common white-savior story line, "Undefeated" depicts Coach Ray working alongside O.C.'s grandmother and siblings in what is a group effort in urging the young man to succeed.)
We never learn what has become of O.C. - or his fellow protagonists Chavis and Montrail - in the two years since they were filmed for "Undefeated." Although the filmmakers work hard at leaving viewers on a triumphant note of uplift, there are far too many ways those fragile life victories can be snatched away. Still, the images of connection across race, class and geographic lines in "Undefeated" subvert a raft of conventional notions that have long held sway in America, from the suburbs as tightly defended islands of racial fear and "I'm-all-right-Jack" privilege to the euphemistic use of words like "privacy" and "self-sufficiency" to talk about selfishness and greed.
What's more, they lay bare the social costs of the vast disparities in wealth that have only widened over the past few decades. And those costs aren't borne only by the poor, as Eva in her huge empty kitchen attests. 
In dramatically different but equally eloquent ways, "We Need to Talk About Kevin" and "Undefeated" remind audiences that in a country where every home is a castle, no castle should be a fortress of solitude.

Arlington police seek 3 robbers who posed as officers

BYLINE: Allison Klein

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B05

LENGTH: 346 words

Arlington County police are seeking three men they say impersonated police in unrelated cases last week, including one home-invasion robbery in which a family was held at knifepoint. 
The first incident happened about 11:20 p.m. Feb. 23 in the 300 block of South Fillmore Street. Two suspects banged on the front door of a house, said "police" and held up a piece of paper purported to be a search warrant, authorities said. 
When the homeowner opened the door, the robbers pushed their way in, said Dustin Sternbeck, an Arlington police spokesman. 
One robber held the woman and her two children at knifepoint on the living room couch, Sternbeck said. The other, armed with a gun, searched the house. Nobody was injured, Sternbeck said, but the men made off with almost $13,000 in cash and jewelry. 
Police describe the suspects: One man was about 6-foot-3 and wore a ski mask, sunglasses, gloves and a winter coat; the other man was about 5-foot-5, had a heavy build and wore eyeglasses.  
The second incident happened the next day in the 3700 block of Lee Highway. A man in a black convertible Ford Mustang pulled up beside a man idling at a red light, identified himself as a police officer and accused the driver of speeding. 
"He said: 'You've been speeding. I've been following you, and you need to pull over,' " Sternbeck said. 
The victim pulled into a parking lot, and the impersonator, who was not wearing a uniform, demanded his driver's license and registration. 
When the victim, 70, pulled out his wallet, the impersonator walked back to his Mustang with it. After the man returned the wallet and drove off, Sternbeck said, the victim realized he was missing $160.
The suspect in that case is described as standing about 5-foot-9 and having an average build.
Police do not believe the incidents are related because of the types of crimes and the descriptions of the robbers.
Arlington police said residents can ask for an officer's badge and badge number when they are pulled over. Residents who think they are in danger should call 911, police said.

Two happy lovers are goaded by an older friend into testing the constancy of the two sisters they adore and learn - after pretending to be called to war and returning in disguise to seduce each other's partners - that all women are fickle. It's a challenge to believe in these characters, and even more of a challenge to try to bring the action into the present day. "Cosi" is a comedy; people are supposed to enjoy themselves, and at a recent show, many of them clearly did. It's a shame that this humor wasn't backed up by anything comparable onstage. Even the Washington National Opera's fine music director, Philippe Auguin, sounded out of his element. Obviously, those who enjoyed the recent performance will find this assessment unfairly cruel about an evening that gave pleasure. But there is so much more pleasure, and charm, and delight to be had from "Cosi."

HUSBANDS AND LOVERS
At Mount Vernon Place United Methodist Church Undercroft Theatre through March 18
When it comes to love, "a woman is like a good driver," a man-about-town generalizes in this daisy chain of wry and witty playlets. As if to prove the point, this lesser-known work - on view in a somewhat stodgy Washington Stage Guild production - features enough canny female emotional motorists to fill the equivalent of the Daytona International Speedway. Newly adapted by Bill Largess, who also directs, "Husbands & Lovers" ostensibly deals with liaisons and deceptions between sophisticates of both sexes in early-20th-century Budapest. Endless love? Unconditional love? Real trust? Absurd notions, according to "Husbands & Lovers." Language itself may be unreliable, and that may be just as well, the play suggests: "Would a conversation between a man and a woman have any interest at all, I wonder," a female character muses, "if the words meant the same thing to both?"

THE LANGUAGE ARCHIVE
At Round House Theatre through March 10
Not until the odd couple in knit caps and bewildered looks wander wide-eyed into "The Language Archive" does a sense of attenuation escape Julia Cho's play. The couple are last-known speakers of a dying tongue and represent a major find by the play's protagonist, George, a linguist who wants to record their voices before their native language dies out. George himself is conversationally challenged, and at home he's barely able to respond when his wife begs him to talk to her about the problems in their marriage. Domestic aridity is not an easy starting point for drama, and the assignment creates a burden for director Jessica Burgess and her leading man. Although the charm of "The Language Archive" is of a low-grade radiance, it does reveal traces of it in its attempt to place on a dramatic scale the variations in the joys and pitfalls of long-term love.

THE WATER ENGINE
At Universalist National Memorial Church through March 11
David Mamet's 1977 play is an anti-corporate melodrama about a hapless factory worker named Charles Lang framed as a 1930s radio play. Lang miraculously devises a water engine only to be crushed in the gears as the Big Boys muscle in. Spooky Action Theater stages Lang's story beyond an old-fashioned radio studio set, in areas we can think of as downstage and stage right. All this is designed to braid in your ear and mind's eye a pulpy, fevered vision of brute capitalism. But unless the complicated atmospherics are arresting enough to catapult you into Mamet's altered state, the play comes off as fussy.

gYOU'RE A GOOD MAN, CHARLIE BROWN
At Olney Theatre Center through March 18
The physical performances in director-choreographer Stephen Nachamie's production are pretty witty, yet the show is hardly a string of slavish impersonations. Nachamie and the gang keep it free, and even up-to-date: When Charlie Brown fantasizes about being an athletic star, he Tebows. The rest of the personalities and their disorders are as you remember, if slightly juiced for the stage. The good impressions mainly come during the deadpan bits pulled straight from the comics, not the songs. Clark Gesner's score isn't especially strong, but "You're a Good Man" will always only sound okay, at best. The show is big, bright, simple: a safe bet for an audience that increasingly salutes the Olney Theatre Center's mainstream musicals.

gANNA IN THE TROPICS
At GALA Hispanic Theatre through Sunday
Nilo Cruz's Pulitzer Prize-winning drama centers on a family-owned cigar factory in the Ybor City section of Tampa in 1929. After the family matriarch hires a lector named Juan Julian, he begins to read "Anna Karenina" to his new audience. Gradually, Tolstoy's tale influences the lives of the factory community in ways that are redemptive, erotic and tragic. It's the personal dynamics that surge to the fore in this production, which marks the Spanish-language premiere of Cruz's play. Actors portraying two sets of couples create moments of arresting intimacy, while emphasizing the human ability to endure and trust in the face of disappointment and suffering. When not deployed in a scene, the actors sometimes stand around the edges of the stage, in view of the audience - a reminder of how personalities, both known and fictional, haunt the imaginations of Cruz's characters.

gASTRO BOY AND THE GOD OF COMICS
At Studio Theatre through March 18
A visit to Natsu Onoda Power's breathtakingly imaginative, eye-delighting performance piece will set your inner 10-year-old free. For this idea-packed excursion into the life and work of cartoonist legend Osamu Tezuka, who created the '60s Japanese robot action hero Astro Boy, Power appropriates the tools of other graphic and creative arts and shows us what it feels like to exert an exuberant control over them all. The piece tries out its own act of animation on the spirit of an artist. And it does so in lovingly virtuoso style, the likes of which Washington theater has not encountered. The play consists of 10 episodes unfolded in reverse chronology, and you have some potential coherence issues. I suspect the director-playwright may be loath to make any pedestrian alterations to her nonlinear construction, but some additional surrender to the need for biographical clarity, especially at the show's outset, would be helpful.

BLOOD WEDDING
At Source through Sunday
Ah, the high ceremony and doom of Federico Garcia Lorca's "Blood Wedding": you can hear it in the opening notes of Mariano Vales's original music for Constellation Theatre's new production. Behzad Habibzai plucks his flamenco guitar and you sit up straight, as if you've just heard a rattlesnake's warning. It turns out to be a false alarm, for this "Blood Wedding" slacks off almost as soon as it begins. Lorca's 1933 tragedy chronicles irresistible passion and a deep family feud, and it does so in a high poetic style that eludes much of this show. The characters are archetypes: the severe Mother, the handsome Groom, the furtive young Bride, etc. Only Leonardo, the hot-tempered rival for the Groom's fiance, has a name. The fable is a sequence of small moments and grand gestures, but the size and suddenness of Lorca's style hasn't really been mastered by director Shirley Serotsky and her cast.

gCIVILIZATION (ALL YOU CAN EAT)
At Woolly Mammoth Theatre through March 11
Sarah Marshall is Big Hog, who starts Jason Grote's weirdly worth-it new play as just another quadruped marked for slaughter and ends up on two feet, the formidable representative of a money culture in which one can claw and devour one's way to the very top. Grote makes the ascendancy of an animal to high social standing one of the narrative pillars of his surrealist exploration of the moral stew of contemporary life. The play is a well-constructed satire, thoughtfully orchestrated by director Howard Shalwitz, and designed for an age of ominous indicators. Although the final tableau could send us out of Woolly with a bit more oomph, it does succeed at its goal of turning our stomachs. In service of that achievement, the play can surely be said to go whole hog.

Friday at 8, Saturday at 3 and 8, Sunday at 2 and 7, and Wednesday-Thursday at 8. 641 D St. NW. 202-393-3939. www.woollymammoth.net. $30-$67.50.

gTHE GAMING TABLE
At Folger Theatre through Sunday
With a buoyant air and a bouquet of ripe performances, Folger Theatre further expands Washington's classical borders with "The Gaming Table," a sendup of 18th-century social probity by the Restoration-comedy playwright Susanna Centlivre. Name doesn't ring a bell? Nope, not with me, either. That's partly why this piquant dish, mounted with considerable aplomb by director Eleanor Holdridge - and dressed to the sensational nines by costume designer Jessica Ford - comes with a side of pleasant discovery. Centlivre, whom history records as a feisty, self-reliant sort, was one of the few women writing popular plays in England at the turn of the 18th century, when comic dramatists such as William Congreve were in vogue. Refreshingly in "The Gaming Table," it's the women who, by and large, dictate romantic terms. They're ladies who know what they want and only reluctantly yield to the entreaties of husbands and suitors.

GENESIS REBOOT
At Synetic Theater at Crystal City through Saturday
Wouldn't you know, no matter how hard the heavenly forces try to prevent it, something always goes wrong when a fallible species is created - especially when profaner spirits can't keep their hands off. That is the tack of director Ben Cunis, who with his brother wrote this modernized fable, an earnest effort that never quite catches fire. The production is in need of a clearer path. While the story of Eden II is fleshed out with energetic earnestness - thanks largely to Eve and Adam - an accompanying version of Cain and Abel provides a strange counterpoint. The umbrella title under which the show is presented, "New Movements," is a bit misleading because the evening is more talk than action. (Irina Tsikurishvili's choreography is, for once, sporadic and disappointing.) Worrisome, too, is the reinforcing here of Synetic Theater's sometime tendency to take on a big, portentous subject without a fully functioning narrative. Maybe the company should change up more often and tackle topics with a larger quantity of helium than lead.

HERCULES IN RUSSIA
At Montgomery College Cultural Arts Center through Sunday
In imagining the life of Jim Hercules, a black Alabaman living in St. Petersburg in the early 20th century, Allyson Currin's historical drama traces ironies and thematic parallels that are sharp and tidy. As Robert K. Massie related in his book "Nicholas and Alexandra," Jim Hercules served as an attendant to the imperial family in the years before the Russian Revolution. In Currin's telling, receiving its world premiere from the Doorway Arts Ensemble, he's a refugee from American racism and race-inspired conflict who finds comfort and security as a loyal member of the St. Petersburg court. Unfortunately, as the play fleshes out these relationships and evokes the lead-up to revolution, it graphs the tale onto a set of trim moral symmetries. Surmounting the script's didacticism, several of director Jessica Lefkow's actors manage to conjure up vibrant characters. However, Ricardo Frederick Evans's Jim is a little flat.

JOSEPHINE TONIGHT
At MetroStage through March 18
Even while applauding the veteran team behind "Josephine Tonight," the undeniably entertaining new musical based on the early life of Josephine Baker now at MetroStage, one can't help coming away from the show with a stubborn sense that something is off. A couple of somethings, actually. "Josephine Tonight" feels small in ways that have little to do with MetroStage's intimate space. In fact, director/choreographer Maurice Hines has filled the stage with crackling dance numbers and sharp acting by the four highly seasoned pros in the cast of five. The rag-and-blues-inspired tunes were composed by the late Wally Harper, best known as singer Barbara Cook's longtime musical director and accompanist. The lyrics and script are by Sherman Yellen, a Tony nominee for the book of the 1970 musical "The Rothschilds." Harper and Yellen's songs often sparkle with wit, melodiousness and infectious rhythm. But there are simply too many songs, especially in the very top-heavy Act One. More important, though, is the lack of depth and grit in the performance of singer/dancer/actress Zurin Villanueva as Josephine Baker. In "Josephine Tonight," Villanueva needs to be the molten core of the show, and she isn't - not yet.

LES JUSTES
At Artisphere through March 11
In WSC Avant Bard's bright, fast production of Albert Camus's "Les Justes (The Just Ones)," the characters gather and debate on a tight, elevated white platform, with the audience in Arlington's intimate Artisphere surrounding the stage. David C. Ghatan's set and lights display the drama as gleamingly as the Hope Diamond. It's a precious setting for the blood-and-guts terrorist philosophizing of Camus's 1949 play, which follows a band of conspirators as they carry out a political assassination. But then, what can you do with Camus? The script, translated and adapted by local actor-director-writer Rahaleh Nassri, is full of idealistic speeches that quickly blow cold on the stage. Terror, Justice and Love are discussed like classroom abstractions, amounting to a 90-minute parade of principles that rapidly begs to be roughed up. The sheer physical energy feels like a stab at pumping up the lofty manner of the play, which is more interested in articulating ideas than in dramatizing them. Only John Stange's Stepan, the figure who argues that even children should not be spared in the pure and necessarily violent crusade for revolutionary change, conveys an urgency that's truly persuasive.

gP.NOKIO: A HIP-HOP MUSICAL
At Imagination Stage through March 11
If you gave "The Phantom Tollbooth" some footlights and a contract with Def Jam Recordings (with a G-rating requirement), you might end up with entertainment as inspired and quirky as "P.Nokio: A Hip-Hop Musical." Sure, the latest Imagination Stage world premiere riffs on the so-well-known-it's-been-Disneyfied story of Pinocchio, the temptation-prone puppet with the telltale growing nose. But playwright Psalmayene 24 doesn't settle for a bland rehash: He imbues his story with so many cheekily precocious allusions and such a modern pulse that his characters might as well be break dancing their way to "Tollbooth's" Dictionopolis. As he demonstrated with "Zomo the Rabbit," which Imagination Stage premiered in 2009, Psalmayene 24 has a flair for folding fairy-tale wonder into an infectious hip-hop vibe. As the director of "P.Nokio" as well as its writer and star, he repeats the trick, teleporting us to the realm of Hip-Hopia, where people pay bills in street credits and boomboxes can be the size of city blocks. One of Hip-Hopia's residents is G.Petto, a computer game designer who creates a screen-transcending animated child named P.Nokio. Sent off to attend the Old School, P.Nokio willfully wanders past a Fork in the road into the Forest of Fraudulent Fun, where he is bamboozled by con artists Fox Madoff and Cat Burgler. Further naughtiness in Gullible Lane saddles P.Nokio with donkey ears, but all ends happily, thanks to the intervention of the rapping, spray-painting Graffiti Fairy and, more important, P.Nokio's real love for G. Petto.

PETER PAN: THE BOY WHO HATED MOTHERS
At H Street Playhouse through Saturday
It's a nasty drop from the warm and fuzzy Darling family of the popular Broadway musical version of "Peter Pan" to the suffering brood of dramatist Michael Lluberes's adaptation. If your temperament is suited to some of the colder considerations of "Peter Pan" - the beloved tale of the boy who defies nature by refusing to grow up - then this inventive though uneven production, written and directed by Lluberes, will strike you as a novel spin on a dramatic chestnut. No Rules Theatre Company's staging in the compact Playhouse space doesn't always allow for the most graceful of scene changes or athletic of sword fights. And during a few talky stretches of the long first act, one wishes that the pirate captain might from time to time level that hook at the script. Still, Lluberes takes an admirable stab at enveloping the two worlds of the story - the Darling household and Neverland - in a unifying starkness, and as a result, makes it clear how thoroughly this scarred Wendy and Peter find consolation in each other's realities.

REALLY REALLY
At Signature Theatre through March 25
This may be the first time you're hearing of Paul Downs Colaizzo, but on the evidence of his crackling new play, "Really Really," the name bears committing to memory. A sexually charged comedy-drama about self-serving collegians of a coldly calculating variety, "Really Really" sucks you in with its brio and caustic wit and holds you with its teasingly clever double-edged plot. As shepherded by Signature's artistic second-in-command, Matthew Gardiner - who hereby submits his credentials for entry to the first-class cabin of Washington directors - "Really Really" is the sharpest original play the Arlington company has offered up in years. Granted, this has not been Signature's strongest suit. Still, the confident wit and topical vitality of "Really Really" assuredly propels Signature into the thick of the region's hunt for new plays of provocation and style. The 26-year-old Colaizzo wags a scandalized finger at his own generation in "Really Really" and cries "shame." Colaizzo's young people - all students, save one, at some American university or other specializing in course work and material comfort - practice what Colaizzo sees as the sorry, single-minded preoccupation of the age: looking out ruthlessly for Number One.

RED
At Arena Stage through March 11
For all its highfalutin discourse, the most engrossing moment of Arena Stage's immensely enjoyable "Red" comes when the two actors dip their brushes into buckets and paint. The activity in which the superbly matched Edward Gero and Patrick Andrews engage, in point of fact, is priming a canvas half again as tall as the two of them. The pleasure of the interlude is in the way it conveys the full, symbiotic immersion of the characters: Gero's Mark Rothko, the vain, abrasive creator of all those mesmerizing canvases of migrating mood and undulating color, and Andrews's Ken, a composite of the assistants who toiled in Rothko's Manhattan studio. Rothko acknowledges anxiety over the pop-art movement that is supplanting abstract expressionism. Ken pricks Rothko's conscience. Both the painter and his assistant know from pain; it's as certain an ingredient in their work as the pigments they mix. Maybe that helps explain why Rothko and his young employee find in the act of priming a canvas a cathartic common pursuit. They don't simply aim to prime that canvas. They want to unleash the Furies on it.

Friday-Saturday and Thursday at 8, Sunday at 2 and 7:30, and Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30. 1101 Sixth St. SW. 202-488-3300. www.arenastage.org. $55-$100.

THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA
At Lansburgh Theatre through Sunday
The Shakespeare Theatre Company's entertaining but over-the-top "The Two Gentlemen of Verona" wastes no time coming at you. PJ Paparelli's production of Shakespeare's comedy about double-crossing friends opens in a fast-food parking lot with teenagers engaging in binge drinking. Yes, it's a comedy: The play has two clowns and a dog, and the lovers and friends spend a lot of time swapping witty repartee. But the emotional switchbacks are sharp, and the play's sudden ending threatens real violence. If the show doesn't quite click, it's largely because of its cineplex-style use of U2 tunes and firearms. Music is oxygen in this milieu, of course, but some of the songs are so painfully on the nose as to be eye-rolling. There are "Glee"-spirited moments that will make you laugh, but that's offset by the sense of applying an easy pop patch where the characters or story seem reluctant to fly. But the big test of how you feel about this lively "Two Gents" is how you respond to its violence. Some of the chase scenes and scuffles are fabulous, but this weaponized show repeatedly pushes its kids to extreme moments of despair and self-damage with razors and pistols, making this play darker and more disturbing. In his last plays, Shakespeare used magic and an expansive spirit to make us accept crazy tales. For the rougher "Two Gents," Paparelli gets it done at gunpoint.

Arm Syrians to fight for their future

BYLINE: Stephen J. Hadley

SECTION: EDITORIAL COPY; Pg. A21

LENGTH: 915 words

The moral case for arming Syrians seeking their freedom has become overwhelming. The world has rarely seen such courage, fortitude and restraint. Despite an unrelenting crackdown by the Assad regime, brave Syrians have kept up their civil resistance campaign for 11 months. Despite systematic attacks by Syrian armed forces killing thousands and wounding tens of thousands, the resistance has, until recently, largely refrained from taking up arms. Surely few people are more entitled to the means to defend themselves in the face of escalating regime brutality. 
Arming Syrians seeking their freedom would have its costs. Bashar al-Assad will brand it as outside intervention and wrap himself in the Syrian flag. His efforts to rally especially uncommitted Syrians in defense of Syrian sovereignty will further divide an already-riven society. And it may not force the Assad regime from power anytime soon.  
Yet that is what is desperately required. 
Saying that Assad has lost legitimacy and ultimately will fall is cold comfort. The longer this struggle goes on, the more militarized it will become. The more militarized it becomes, the more Syria's future will be dictated by who has the most guns, not who gets the most votes. Look at the Libyan Transitional National Council's struggle to control that country's militias, and contrast that with the more democratic evolution in Tunisia. 
And the more militarized the Syrian struggle becomes, the greater the opportunity for al-Qaeda. Events in Somalia and Yemen show how al-Qaeda thrives on chaos and violence. For the sake of preserving human life and a democratic future for Syria, the Assad regime needs to go now. 
So why is the Assad regime still in power? Because it enjoys the support of the Syrian army (which, despite some defections, still supports the regime); the Sunni business community (particularly in Damascus and Aleppo); and the Alawites and other minority communities (including Kurds, Christians and Druze). These groups must be persuaded to break with the regime and join the opposition. 
The Syrian National Council needs to be at the forefront of this effort. It would help unify the badly divided council. It would also increase the council's credibility within Syria and the international community as a unifying, inclusive, cross-sectarian political force. 
If the effort succeeds, it will not only topple Assad but also help create a stable, democratic Syria in which all sectarian communities feel secure and strive together to build a common future. The post-Arab Awakening Middle East desperately needs such examples of cross-sectarian pluralism and cooperation. Such a Syria would help avoid destabilizing neighboring Iraq and Lebanon, which in different ways are also striving to provide democratic examples to the region. 
The United States, the Arab League, Turkey and the rest of Europe need to work closely with the Syrian National Council in developing this approach and to echo the council's message publicly and privately to these three groups. 
l To the Syrian army: If you break with Assad now and support the council, you will have a role in the new Syria; if not, you will be held responsible for the regime's crimes by Syrian and international tribunals. 
l To the Sunni business community: Assad is going down, and the sooner he does, the sooner profitable business relations with the dynamic Turkish business community can resume. (The Turkish government urging Turkish businesses to send this message privately to their Syrian counterparts could be especially helpful.) 
l To the various minorities, especially the Alawites: There is safety, security and a role for you in the new Syria if you break with Assad now, but this will be harder to ensure if you don't. 
Finally, the United States needs to organize the international community in developing  a concrete plan to help a post-Assad Syria reform its economy, stimulate economic growth and train its young people in the skills of the 21st century. Business, nongovernmental organizations, charitable foundations and universities of the Arab states, Europe and the United States should not just be involved but also lead. This plan is needed now to further motivate the key pillars of the regime to split away and support the Syrian National Council. 
If it works, this approach is better than a Libya-style military intervention. Libya was a one-off case. We and our NATO allies did it because we could. Libya had fewer than 6.5 million people and an army that Moammar Gaddafi purposely kept weak. Its major population centers were along the Mediterranean coast, within range of NATO ships at sea and NATO air bases.
None of these advantages are present with Syria. Outside military intervention would produce a narrative that Western powers had once again toppled an Arab dictator. A better narrative for the Syrian people, the region and the United States is that the Syrian National Council lead the Syrian people in overthrowing a tyrant. 
To strengthen these political messages, we should begin now to build public and international support for arming the Syrians seeking freedom. The United States will need to take the lead so that such arming does not become a vehicle for a proxy war in Syria between competing regional states but instead contributes to building a stable and democratic Syria for all its people.

Va. Democrats' turn to overreach

BYLINE: Editorial Board

SECTION: EDITORIAL COPY; Pg. A22

LENGTH: 507 words

VIRGINIA REPUBLICANS have embarrassed themselves in the unforgiving glare of the national spotlight this winter by muscling through the General Assembly a batch of partisan, incendiary and pointlessly provocative legislation. They've enacted bills to thrill the gun lobby (and gun traffickers), delight antiabortion activists and impede voters who lack IDs - mainly Democratic-leaning minority, poor and elderly citizens - based on phony concerns about the nonexistent problem of voting fraud. 
Sensing an advantage, Democrats in the state Senate are now striking back with a partisan foray of their own. Using the 20 seats they control in the 40-member upper house, they have blocked passage of the state's two-year budget and are threatening a government shutdown - unprecedented in Richmond in modern times - unless Republicans redress what Democrats think is a skewed balance of power. Specifically, they want Senate committees, where real legislative power often resides, to reflect the body's even split between Democrats and Republicans.
That's not likely to happen. Like it or not - and Democrats obviously don't - the Republicans have cemented their control of the Senate with the tie-breaking vote of Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling, a Republican who serves in what has generally been, until this year, the ceremonial role of Senate president. The budget is one of the few areas where Mr. Bolling is barred by the state Constitution from wielding the dispositive vote, so Democrats have seized on it as leverage to exact the power they think is their due.
Maybe it's inevitable that the prairie fires of partisanship, which have blazed through state houses across the country, would engulf the traditionally genteel capitol in Richmond. Still, the Democrats' maneuver is overreaching, self-serving and cynical, and it may do the party more  harm than good.
The $85 billion budget being held hostage was crafted with the participation of Democrats, who raised no major objections to it at critical junctures. In fact, largely because of Democrats, the Senate version of the budget restores funding for education, health and social services that was cut by Gov. Robert F. McDonnell, a Republican, and by the GOP-dominated House.
Ordinarily, differences in the Senate and House versions of the budget would be hammered out in conference between leaders of the two bodies. In this case, Democrats killed off both versions, including their own, and stalked off the playing field.
The few, flimsy objections Democrats have raised about the budget are a smokescreen. Their real issue is power-sharing: Democrats want it; Republicans won't give it.
In this instance, the Republicans are right: They have the tie-breaking vote in the person of Mr. Bolling. It's no surprise that Democrats would like to negate that advantage, but the means to do so are through elections, not the nuclear option of government shutdown. And given Republican overreach, Democrats would be shrewder to stand down and let the GOP continue to lay the groundwork for its own defeat.

'Why look for change?'

DATELINE: IN WASHINGTON, OKLA.

Here is the only light amid the Sunday-night darkness of the plains, its yellow glow visible for a mile around. People travel here down two-lane roads, past flags that snap in the wind and a sign that reads "Only God Can Save America." They park in front of the steeple at the corner of Center and Main. Pastor Fred Greening greets them at the door. 
Theirs is a church of 400 in a town of 600, where four generations stand together to bow their heads in prayer. Cowboys wear boots and roughnecks wear flannel. A 9-year-old sets down his toy truck and clasps his hands. Together they recite pledges of allegiance to the United States, to the Bible and to the Christian flag.
"May God guide us and watch over us," an assistant pastor says. "May He work to preserve our community and the values we hold dear." 
Oklahoma will hold its Republican primary on Super Tuesday, bringing the cultural debate over the heart of conservatism to the conservative heartland. The presidential campaign has turned into an argument about values and faith - a battle long underway on the prairie of central Oklahoma. Here, they fight to protect their town from what Pastor Greening calls the "slow and steady decay of moral America": the erosion of traditional marriage; the methamphetamine addicts content to rely on public assistance; the political correctness creeping ever south from the college in nearby Norman, which they fear will force God out of their government offices and schools. 
Now more than ever, they want a politician in that Washington who will safeguard the culture of this one. 
Four years after an election defined by Hope and Change, Oklahoma remains a place that mostly hopes not to change. All 77 counties in the state voted for the Republican candidate in each of the past two presidential elections. Even as every other state in the country became more liberal or more conservative, the politics of Oklahoma stood still: Exactly 65.6 percent of people here voted for President George W. Bush in 2004, and exactly 65.6 percent voted for Sen. John McCain in 2008. 
Change also has been forestalled here in Washington, a grid of single-story houses surrounded by wheat fields and flood plains. The cotton gin and feed mill still frame Main Street, and decades-old graffiti still cover the water tower. A few dozen men still gather each morning at the American Legion to play dominos, crack peanuts and spit tobacco juice on the floor. The same "In God We Trust" posters still hang at the public high school, which serves the same pizza pockets on Mondays and throws the same Christmas party that is never called a holiday party, and where no extracurricular events are scheduled on Wednesdays or Sundays because those days are reserved for church. 
On this Sunday night, Pastor Greening talks to congregants about what he calls his "big deal" topics: the sanctity of marriage, the war on Christianity and the threat of sharia law. He moved here from Chicago a decade ago because he wanted to live "someplace more principled and simple, where people aren't afraid to talk about the 900-pound gorillas in the room." Now he delivers roses to the state Capitol each year to representatives who oppose abortion, and he leads annual service trips to Central America. He has grown the church property from one acre to 11 and built a campus with gym space and classrooms.
"I've found a very receptive congregation," he says, "a place that has a common purpose."
Everyone here is living a version of the conservative life. Each is fighting to preserve the sanctity of this place. 
Pastor Greening offers a final prayer. "May the Lord bring you courage and strength," he tells them, and the congregants file out of the church.
One of them is Mark Tague, 44, who wakes the next morning to the same routine that has grounded his family for 100 years. It's calving season, and he heads out to his 160 acres of yellowed grass and sienna dirt to check on the herd. He drives a white Ford pickup with the high school logo affixed to the bumper. His 5-year-old daughter, Lily, sits in the back seat. They pull up to a newborn calf, only a few minutes old, and roll down the window to watch it take its first steps.
"Good gravy, he's looking good, isn't he, Lily?" he says.
"I like him," she says. 
Tague went away to college after high school, got a job in finance and lived in St. Louis for a few years, but he moved home to Washington as soon as his company told him he could work remotely. His ancestors, Chickasaw Indians, were forced to Oklahoma on the Trail of Tears in the 1830s, and they eventually built barns and a bank and turned the town into a railroad stop. His great-grandparents donated land to build the Washington schools, and his grandparents were part of the first graduating class. His mother went there. His three children go there now.
"I want my kids to grow up with values and ways of life that I had and my parents had," he says, so his youngest son tools around the garage on a Big Wheel, and his oldest daughter keeps her riding horse at the family barn built in 1907, and they buy their drinking milk from Braun's because he always has. "Why look for change?" he says. "I like to know that what you see is what you get."
What you see is Sid's Easy Shop opening downtown each morning at 6, where Sid will sell you gas, rent you a movie, make you a new set of keys or bring your soda to one of the classic red booths preserved from the 1950s. The post office, its roof painted red and white to reflect the stripes of the American flag, opens for business a few hours later. Next door to that, Casey operates her coffee shop with the help of her husband and five kids, who take turns working the register, Yes Sir and Yes Ma'am, and sell T-shirts imprinted with the phrase "Make God Famous."
What you see is a parade of several dozen well-wishers lining the street and stretching out their hands to the bus every time one of the varsity high school teams leaves to play a road game, and a few hundred people gathering for community workdays to fix up the Little League field so Washington doesn't waste money on parks and rec. Almost all of the houses in town are single-story ranchers, and more than 70 percent belong to married couples - few Hispanic, fewer black, none Muslim and none openly gay. 
What you see are calves dropping in the spring, coyotes circling at night, shooting stars, roaring tornados and thick flocks of birds migrating across skies that round over the horizon.
"Is there anyplace else?" Tague wonders. 
He looks more like a financier than a farmer, with wire-rimmed glasses, close-cropped hair and an iPhone he uses to check the per-pound prices for live cattle. He still travels every few weeks to Indianapolis or St. Louis for his job at a thriving mortgage industry start-up, but he dreams of expanding his herd and raising cattle full time.
If he can't do it, maybe his children will.
"You want this place, Lily?" he asks.
She smiles and nods. 
"Good," he says, " 'cause I'm going to make sure you get it."
Another of Pastor Greening's congregants wakes a day later in the house she constructed with her husband and three children outside of town, where there is fresh venison in the refrigerator and four horses grazing outside. Lisa Billy, 45, grew up nearby in the small town of Purcell, where she shook pecan trees, hauled hay and cared for pigs and horses. She watches "Andy Griffith" reruns. She prefers to wear a U.S. Marines baseball cap and cowboy boots stitched with the Holy Cross. "I am rural Oklahoma," she says. 
But, on this day, she dresses in a business suit, puts in hoop earrings, grabs her Bible and heads north. She drives an hour on the freeway to Oklahoma City, straight into the culture war.
Billy is the state legislator elected to defend the values of this place - her values. She is the granddaughter of a Golden Gloves boxer, a petite woman with intense eyes and high cheekbones who volunteers to carry most abortion bills through the House and who local antiabortion groups herald as "fearless." But, lately, she has been receiving a few hundred hateful e-mails about her newest piece of legislation: a "personhood" bill that would give rights to a fetus from the moment of conception. So vicious are some of the e-mails that she has asked her 17-year-old son to accompany her at night for protection.
She calls an assistant pastor on her way to Oklahoma City for spiritual advice and receives text messages from the supporters she regards as her "prayer warriors." She parks near the Capitol, where protesters have assembled outside. Her bill won't be voted on for weeks, but protesters come daily. Billy walks into her office and closes the door. She calls her assistant into the room. "Pray with me," she says.
The walls of the office are decorated with a certificate of recognition from Americans United for Life, with a Call to Prayer for Oklahomans, with a list of 30 Ways to Pray for People in Authority. The Bible and the House Rulebook are stacked at the center of her desk. "Those are the two things that guide me here," she says, "and the primary one is the word of God."
Outside her window, more than 300 people gather on the Capitol steps to protest the personhood bill. Women dress in costume, wearing aprons and carrying rolling pins to mimic a place that seems stuck in another time. One speaker yells: "Welcome to Oklahoma. Now turn your clock back 50 years." Another follows: "Religion doesn't belong in my ovaries or my Congress."
Meanwhile, Billy and her assistant walk upstairs to the Capitol's weekly devotional luncheon. Billy takes her seat at the head of the table and stands to speak. "It's nice to be surrounded by other believers," she says. One pastor prays over lunch, another prays for the legislators, and then Billy asks if she can pray for the pastors.
"Thank you for allowing us to gather and share in your wisdom, Lord," she says, eyes closed, head bowed, voice rhythmic. "We know it's a challenge when we're standing in the middle of a trial. Let us be calm under fire in the spirit of Jesus."
She leaves the Capitol an hour later for another meeting. She drives past the protesters, past the skyscrapers of downtown, past the bars surrounding the University of Oklahoma, past the roadside casino with its flashing marquee advertising "good action and generous slots." She exits the freeway and turns onto a two-lane road, winding her way back toward the familiarity of Washington.
Where, the next morning, a Wednesday, Sid opens at 6. A dozen men show up at the Legion to play dominos at 7. The kids at school recite the Pledge of Allegiance at 8:30 and spend a moment in silent prayer. 
A storm rolls across the sky. Flagpoles rattle in the wind. 
Another day is happily the same.
Night falls, and one yellow light interrupts the darkness of the prairie. The congregants travel past the water tower and the feed mill and the cotton gin to the corner of Center and Main. Pastor Greening waits at the door.

2 U.S. troops killed at base in Afghanistan

BYLINE: Sayed Salahuddin

DATELINE: KABUL

KABUL - Two coalition troops were killed at a NATO-Afghan base Thursday by up to two Afghan gunmen, one of them apparently a soldier and the other a civilian teaching a course on the base, NATO and Afghan officials said.
A local official said both of the slain service members were American. The shootings raise to six the number of U.S. troops killed in recent days on military bases or at Afghan government facilities. 
Two of those troops were fatally shot by an Afghan soldier a week ago, when a mob attacked a joint base during protests over the burning of Korans by U.S. military personnel at Bagram air base a few days earlier. U.S. officials said the incineration was accidental. Two other service members, acting as advisers, were slain by a police officer at the Afghan Interior Ministry on Saturday, prompting NATO to withdraw its personnel from government ministries.
At least 10 Americans have been killed this year by Afghan security forces or militants wearing military or police uniforms.
No motive was given for the slayings Thursday, and officials differed on whether one or two men were responsible. The shootings occurred hours after NATO's top commander in Afghanistan, Marine Gen. John R. Allen, decided to allow the return of selected coalition advisers to some Afghan ministries. 
On Thursday, a senior U.N. official in Kabul seconded a call by Afghan President Hamid Karzai for the U.S. military to discipline those involved in the Koran burning, Reuters news agency reported. President Obama and top U.S. defense officials have apologized profusely for the incident.
"After the first step of a profound apology, there must be a second step . . . of disciplinary action," Jan Kubis, special representative for the U.N. secretary general in Afghanistan, said at a news conference, according to Reuters. He said the United Nations "rejected and condemned" the burnings, adding: "It doesn't matter that it was a mistake."
Obama's formal apology to Karzai for the incident had drawn criticism from political opponents at home, as well as some members of the U.S. military. The president defended his decision Wednesday, saying the apology had "calmed things down" after the incident provoked deadly violence across Afghanistan.
"We're not out of the woods yet," Obama said in an interview with ABC News's Bob Woodruff at the White House. "But my criteria in any decision I make, getting recommendations from folks who are actually on the ground, is what is going to best protect our folks and make sure that they can accomplish their mission." 
The Thursday killings occurred before dawn at a base in the Zhari district of southern Kandahar province, said district chief Niaz Mohammad Sarhadi. He said a local civilian teaching Afghan army literacy courses got control of a soldier's rifle and fatally shot the two U.S. service members, who were on duty inside the base.
A NATO statement said that in addition to the Afghan civilian, a man who was thought to be a member of the Afghan army also was involved in the shootings. The two men "turned their weapons indiscriminately" against NATO and Afghan soldiers, the statement said, killing the two coalition troops. 
A third American soldier was wounded in the attack, Sarhadi said. NATO troops responded by opening fire, he added, killing the teacher and an Afghan soldier.
Capt. Justin Brockhoff, a spokesman for NATO, confirmed the killing of two coalition troops but refused to identify them by nationality, citing the need to notify next of kin. Brockhoff said he did not know whether the deaths would prompt Allen to again pull back U.S. advisers from Afghan ministries.
More than 70 NATO troops are estimated to have been killed by rogue Afghan colleagues or insurgents who have infiltrated the ranks of the nation's security forces in recent years.
The killings are seen as a major challenge for the NATO coalition, which plans to withdraw all combat troops by the end of 2014 and wants to focus on training and equipping the nascent Afghan army so it can stop the resurgent Taliban and stabilize Afghanistan.
Afghan officials say they are trying to introduce procedures to prevent the penetration of insurgents into the ranks of the Afghan army and to identify soldiers who have sympathy for insurgents.

Sarkozy takes refugefrom protests in bar
French President Nicolas Sarkozy took refuge from a crowd of several hundred angry protesters in a cafe Thursday, as riot police swarmed in to protect him while he campaigned in the country's southwestern Basque region.
Riot police surrounded the Bar du Palais, in central Bayonne, where Sarkozy stayed for about an hour to get away from the protesters - some of them Basque nationalists, others carrying posters of his rival in the presidential race, Socialist Francois Hollande.
The French president's security entourage is typically smaller than, say, the U.S. president's detail, and it has been particularly sparse at some recent campaign events, as Sarkozy has tried to connect with voters. Even so, the siege of a world leader was a bizarre turn of events, with French TV repeatedly showing footage of the crowds. 
Inside the cafe, where he met with residents of Bayonne, Sarkozy denounced "the violence of a minority and their unacceptable behavior."
The conservative Sarkozy trails Hollande in polls ahead of the two-part April and May presidential election.

New leader blockedfrom making speech
A raucous opposition protest kept the Maldives' president waiting more than nine hours and ultimately prevented him from opening parliament on Wednesday, three weeks after he took office in a contentious power transfer.
Mohammed Waheed Hassan arrived at parliament in the morning and sat in a waiting room during the day while protesters blocked roads and clashed with police. He returned home late in the evening without opening and addressing parliament as required by the constitution after a leadership change..
Lawmakers from ex-president Mohamed Nasheed's party also removed the seats reserved for the president and the speaker in parliament.
Nasheed resigned last month after weeks of public protests and loss of support from the military and police. He later said he was ousted in a coup and was forced to resign at gunpoint.

Gunman fires on U.S. team in Yemen; no one hurt, officials say

DATELINE: ADEN, YEMEN

ADEN, Yemen - A gunman opened fire on a U.S. security team that was training Yemeni soldiers in the south of the country, the Pentagon and a local security official said Friday, both denying reports from an Islamist group that a CIA officer was killed in the assault. 
In the country's north, meanwhile, a bomb blast hit an anti-U.S. protest, injuring at least 22 people, according to a rebel group that controls much of the region.
Fighting with northern Houthi rebels and southern militants are among the challenges facing Yemen's new president, Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, a man Washington was hoping could end a year of turmoil in the country.
Ansar al-Sharia, a Yemen-based Islamist group linked to al-Qaeda, said it had attacked and killed a U.S. officer in the south Thursday.
 "The mujihadeen killed a CIA officer on Thursday while he was in Aden province, after tracking him and determining he was cooperating with the Sanaa government," it said in a text message sent to journalists in Yemen.
A Yemeni security official in Aden, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that a gunman fired on a U.S. security team Thursday but that the shots had hit their armored vehicle without injuring anyone.
In Washington, a Pentagon spokesman confirmed that a gunman fired several shots at an armored vehicle carrying a U.S. security team in Yemen and said that no one was wounded.
Fears that political turmoil in Yemen would embolden al-Qaeda's wing in the country led Washington and Gulf Arab states to broker the exit of Hadi's predecessor, Ali Abdullah Saleh, after a year of mass protests against his rule.
Saleh's departure made him the fourth Arab leader to be removed from power since uprisings swept east from Tunisia in late 2010, rattling U.S. allies and foes alike.
Hadi, who won a one-candidate election to replace Saleh last week, has promised to lead Yemen to new elections, create a new constitution and reform the military within two years. He inherits multiple conflicts, including clashes with secessionists in the south and the long-simmering insurgency in the north.
Islamist militants took control of swaths of territory in southern Yemen during the struggle over Saleh's fate.
The bomb that exploded during a protest against U.S. involvement in Yemen injured 22 people in the north, according to the leader of Shiite Muslim rebels who control the area. In a statement, the leader of the Houthi movement - Shiite rebels whom Yemen's military tried to crush in campaigns in 2004-2009 - blamed the U.S. ambassador in the capital, Sanaa, for the explosion in Saada, near the Saudi border.
 The region has been the site of fighting recently between the Houthis and Sunni Muslims espousing puritanical Salafi doctrines that are influential in Saudi Arabia and cast Shiites as heretics. The Houthis accuse the Saudi government of arming their foes.

Ruling party makesgains in Senate vote
Pakistan's ruling party made gains in upper house elections Friday, a boost for President Asif Ali Zardari in his long-running conflict with the country's top court and the military.
By late evening, Zardari's Pakistan People's Party appeared to be on course to gain control of the Senate, giving him political firepower for several years to come. The results were expected given the party's majority in the lower house and strong presence in provincial legislatures, which elect the senators.
The Senate can block legislation and takes part in impeachment proceedings.  
Some of Zardari's rivals had hoped he would be forced to call early general elections, be ousted by the Supreme Court or face a coup before the Senate vote could be held.

Suicide blast kills 23at insurgent base
A suicide bomber attacked the headquarters of a rival insurgent group in northwestern Pakistan on Friday, killing 23 of its supporters in an outbreak of factional fighting, an official said.
Elsewhere in the Afghan border region, fighting between security forces and militants killed 41 others on an especially deadly day that showed the level of instability 10 years after the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan.
Clashes among insurgents are common along the border, where tribal loyalties hold sway and the Pakistani government has little or no control. Smuggling, kidnapping for ransom and drug production are lucrative businesses for militant groups.
The suicide bomber struck the base of the Lashkar-e-Islam group in the Tirah Valley, where Pakistani security forces are fighting militants threatening the nearby city of Peshawar, officials said.
A commander of the Pakistani Taliban, which is a local rival of Lashkar-e-Islam, asserted responsibility for the attack.

Most Chinese cities failing air standards, official says: Two-thirds of China's cities fail to meet stricter air-quality standards that the government wants to phase in over four years to combat smoggy skies, a senior Chinese environmental official said. The announcement came two days after the State Council, China's cabinet, set new limits on pollutants to go into effect nationwide by 2016.
Prosecutors seek wider Hariri indictment: Prosecutors at a court set up in The Hague to bring to justice the assassins of former Lebanese prime minister Rafiq al-Hariri want to expand their indictment against four members of the Hezbollah Shiite militia charged in the 2005 truck bombing. The new charge, criminal association, would be added to existing charges that include homicide and terrorism.
Algerian opposition to take part in vote: Algeria's biggest opposition party said it would take part in May 10 parliamentary elections, ending a 15-year boycott and lending credibility to government promises that the vote will be more democratic than in the past. Algeria, largely untouched by the Arab Spring revolts that have toppled leaders in three of its neighboring countries, is under pressure at home and from abroad to loosen the ruling elite's grip on power.

Wizards' Blatche is eager to get back

BYLINE: Michael Lee

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. D02

LENGTH: 624 words

Andray Blatche had waited so long to be back on the court, back with his teammates, that he couldn't leave the floor on Thursday immediately after the Washington Wizardsconcluded practice. He stayed around to play two-on-two basketball with rookies Jan Vesely, Chris Singleton and Shelvin Mack, eagerly trying to make up for more than an entire month of lost time. 
Blatche backed down Vesely, spun around him and rose up for a left-handed dunk. He missed, throwing the ball off the back of the rim but showed plenty of explosiveness and elevation off of the injured left calf that has kept him sidelined since Jan. 28. Blatche is expected to make his return against Cleveland on Saturday at Verizon Center.  
"I get back to balling. Just balling, hooping and having fun," Blatche said. "Being without basketball is especially tough. It's something I grew up with, so I'm just excited about this whole weekend that's coming up for me. It's a chance for me to go back out and do something I love to do."
Coach Randy Wittman said he plans to ease Blatche back and use him in short stints, since the adrenaline rush of the return won't make up for the lack of conditioning that comes from him missing the past 15 games. 
The Wizards have been only slightly better with Blatche in the lineup (4-13) than without him this season (3-15) but will need another offensive option with Nick Young and Rashard Lewis both out against the Cavaliers with knee injuries. Blatche is having an admittedly down season, as he has been benched twice, is shooting a career-low 38 percent and averaging just 10.3 points - his worst scoring average in three seasons. 
Barring a miraculous finish, he will fail to improve upon his statistics from the previous season for the first time in his seven-year career. But Blatche said the calf injury - which occurred on a "freak play" in which he attempted to take a charge on Charlotte's Boris Diaw - forced him to rest and get fully healthy, something he hasn't been all season because of a nagging right shoulder injury that he suffered nearly a year ago.
"Being without basketball is never good news," Blatche said, but "it helped a lot, my shoulder. I have no problem out of it at all. Even though I lost something, I gained something back. My shoulder and my calf is good. It helped me get my body back right, and I can come out Saturday and be back to being the person that I am."
Blatche said he wants to get back to being "Seven-Day 'Dray" - the player he was during the two-month period that helped him earn a three-year, $28 million extension before last season. That contract has come back to haunt the Wizards, who have actively tried to trade the 6-foot-11 Blatche but found no takers. 
The Wizards have just six more games before the March 15 trade deadline, but Blatche said he wouldn't let the speculation affect how he approaches the next two weeks - or the rest of the season. "That's the life of the NBA. You've got to take the punches, whatever they are. It's a business."
Blatche was immobile after suffering the injury, but he has been working diligently the past two weeks, doing work in the pool and weight room, and even working out in preparation for a comeback with former teammate Awvee Storey at the practice facility.
Home fans have unmercifully booed Blatche this season, and he expressed some frustration over his treatment. Before a recent game, Blatche even pondered how his image would be used to incite fans to jeer if he ever leaves. 
Blatche said he is anxious to return and make amends for his poor season. "I can't wait to get back on the court. It's something that's a part of me. Even with all the bad things going on, I don't care about it, I just want to go back to playing."

How to get Afghans to trust us once again

BYLINE: Fernando M. Lujֳ¡n

SECTION: OUTLOOK; Pg. B01

LENGTH: 1756 words

"Ooooh, Major Far-nan-do, we're gonna sell you to the Taliban for a million dollars . . . laa-di-laaa . . . we're gonna trade you for a new truck . . . for a new house!"
It was late at night in Helmand province last summer, and my Afghan army companions - Jawad and Raz Mohammed - were improvising a song in Dari, clapping their hands to the beat. They could barely get through a verse without bursting into laughter. I did my best to laugh, too. We were friends, and they were joking, but for a moment it made me wonder: Could I trust these men? Would they try to sell me? And what was I doing out here alone? In fact, was it safe for any of us, a few thousand U.S. advisers, to be embedded in Afghan military units across the country? 
After the recent burning of Korans at a NATO baseand theviolence that has followed, I'm not the only one worried about the prospects for the advisory mission in Afghanistan. The accidental desecration of Islam's holy book, in which five U.S. soldiers were found to be involved, and the resulting riots and killings of American troops reveal a crisis of trust between Afghans and Americans. To rebuild that relationship, we need to focus not just on the Taliban insurgency, but also on dissolving Afghan security forces' resentment of coalition troops and defeating the pervasive notion that our forces are in Afghanistan to destroy Islam.
As an Army major, it is not my role to debate policy. However, my job in Afghanistan over the past year gave me a unique perspective on the difficulties of building trust. I was on a small team of special operators, governance experts, and Dari- or Pashto-speaking U.S. officers embedded with coalition and Afghan units across the country, coaching, advising and listening to their problems. Sometimes we wore beards and Afghan uniforms and patrolled in Ford Rangers rather than armored trucks, and often we were the only Americans on remote bases - all in hopes of getting a real sense of what Afghan soldiers thought when their Western partners weren't around.
One of the first things we learned was the power of a simple narrative, repeated endlessly by the Taliban: The coalition is here to occupy Afghanistan and destroy Islam. This message is at the core of the Taliban's strategy; the group uses it to draw recruits, win sympathy from civilians and encourage soldiers to defect. While the Afghans we worked with protected us from harm - often at great risk to themselves - sometimes doubt would creep into our conversations: Why do you speak our language? Are you a Muslim? Why not? Do you want to take away our religion?
Many of these men had never heard of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. They didn't know why we were in their country.
Any coalition action in Afghanistan - no matter how accidental - that feeds the perception of a Western-led war on Islam endangers the mission and destroys trust. The smallest mistakes are amplified by the Taliban through videos,  magazines, DVDs, Web sites, personal visits and other methods. A committed cadre of Taliban agents will infiltrate peaceful demonstrations to incite violence and provoke a strong coalition reaction - so that the cycle of mistrust can begin again. To defeat this threat to the U.S.-Afghan relationship, leaders at all levels must not only avoid making unforced errors but also take actions every day to convince their Afghan colleagues, then the local population, that they respect Islam.
For example, just west of Kandahar last summer, my team came across an American platoon that worked with the Afghan army to engage local religious leaders. Though hesitant at first, the Afghan soldiers got permission to pray in the village mosque alongside the civilians they protected. Later, when two young children were killed by a Taliban mine, the soldiers - at their advisers' recommendation - encouraged the mullah to denounce the incident from his mosque's loudspeaker, sending a powerful message to the population about the hypocrisy of the Taliban's actions: What kind of Muslim would kill our innocent children?
In the aftermath of the Koran-burning incident, it is this type of local, immediate response - from Afghan to Afghan - that has the best chance of shaping perceptions. During this tense time, American advisers all over the country should sit down with their Afghan colleagues to discuss the Muslim faith, and should listen more than they talk. I did this nearly every time I visited a new Afghan unit, in response to questions about my own faith. Once the Afghans saw I was eager to learn about Islam, they took care of me and defended my presence to the local population.
As damaging as religious misunderstandings can be, the gradual drawdown of coalition troops presents its own challenges. Advisers, working in remote areas and facing the threat of Taliban infiltration, sometimes respond by separating themselves from the Afghans, withdrawing behind barricades, strict rules and technology. On one patrol in southeast Afghanistan last year, we watched a line of sputtering Afghan army pickup trucks try to clear a road laden with IEDs while American forces trailed at the rear in heavily armored vehicles bristling with advanced anti-mine devices. The Afghans muttered as they hopped down from their trucks to search for the explosives by hand: "Are they cowards? Are their lives more important than ours?"
Later, we saw a well-known Afghan colonel who had fought the Taliban for many years get roughly searched; he was nearly denied admission to an operations briefing with American forces. In both cases, the Americans were following procedure - yet they were unknowingly sabotaging their mission. While Afghan officers may smile politely in meetings, they trust you only if you've shared danger and hardship. There is no shortcut to earning their respect.
Of course, the U.S. military should not do away with armored vehicles or rules, but it should pay close attention to the experience, training and judgment of those selected to be advisers. Not everyone can do this type of mission. Every day, with every action, an adviser must weigh the impact it could have on Afghan relationships. In this sense, NATO's withdrawal of personnel from Kabul ministries after the shootings of American officers, while understandable, has temporarily achieved the Taliban's intent - separating coalition advisers from their Afghan partners.
Yet even in some of the most dangerous areas of Kandahar, we saw the best advisers bridge this gap: They smiled  and made friends but carried a loaded pistol under their shirt. They spent hours drinking tea but looked doubly close at the Afghan who claimed to have just returned from leave in Pakistan.
The last obstacle to the American-Afghan relationship is resentment within the Afghan security forces. I do not imply that Afghan units are hotbeds of anti-Americanism - they are not. My team of advisers embedded with nearly 20 Afghan battalions across Kandahar and Helmand provinces, and we were always well received and protected. But when we talked to the Afghan soldiers in their language, we heard many frustrations with how coalition soldiers treated them.
They complained of young U.S. soldiers acting like drill sergeants, screaming and cursing at the Afghans and making them do push-ups. (While this behavior is common in American basic training, in the respect-based culture of Afghanistan, such treatment is a violation of one's honor.) We stayed in camps where the Afghans slept in straw huts with smoke from a trash fire blowing on them, while coalition members lounged in air-conditioned trailers. During Ramadan, a month in which Muslims abstain from food and drink from sunrise to sundown, we watched American troops dragging their Afghan colleagues on an operation and noisily drinking water in front of them in midday summer heat.
These types of cultural misunderstandings and oversights rarely lead to "green-on-blue" (Afghan-against-American) violence. More often, they erode trust and respect - and with them, the ability of coalition units to influence their Afghan partners.
Yet the raw talent to succeed in the advisory mission is there within the ranks: Nearly everywhere we visited, we encountered advisers doing phenomenal work with their Afghan colleagues, fighting the challenges I've described and building trust in the process. In this environment, language, cultural fluency and long-term relationships are priceless. But advisers rarely receive serious language training and usually quickly rotate through Afghan units, making it difficult to form close relationships. And while last year's surge in resources and troops has allowed the coalition to reverse the Taliban's momentum in southern Afghanistan, it has occasionally bred arrogance: Why work through Afghans when you can do the job yourself?
Thus, the true challenge of the advisory mission is not finding brave and talented Americans, but overcoming institutional and bureaucratic hurdles - the tendency to assign jobs without regard to skill or aptitude, to think in terms of resources instead of relationships, to neglect training that doesn't come on the rifle range. This is a challenge that can be overcome if leaders are willing to break with conventional practices and embrace the idea of smaller embedded teams of well-trained advisers. Even if they are vastly outnumbered, Americans will be safer and more effective if they are forced to rely on the Afghans.
The loss of U.S. soldiers on secure bases, at the hands of Afghans we thought to be allies, is much harder to accept than the loss of soldiers on patrol. Yet this is a fundamental part of the conflict in Afghanistan. Even if coalition forces refuse to let the threat of Taliban infiltration alienate them from their Afghan partners, even if they continue to demonstrate respect for Islam and bridge cultural divides, we will lose good people in similar incidents. The Taliban is ruthless and committed. But the Afghans don't hate us, despite the fact that sometimes we try really hard to make them hate us.
I never told my singing Afghan friends, but later that night in Helmand, I was startled from my sleep, nervous about their joke. When I opened my eyes, I saw a shadow in the doorway. Struck with fear, I reached for my pistol, only to realize that the shadow was Jawad, the one who had joked about selling me to the Taliban. He was guarding me as I slept.

Victim's sister calls Dahmer tour evil
The sister of one of Jeffrey Dahmer's 17 victims joined others in protesting a Milwaukee walking tour of the serial killer's haunts Saturday, calling out to tour organizers that they were "just as evil" as Dahmer. 
Janie Hagen's brother, 25-year-old Richard Guerrero, disappeared in 1988 and was one of the first young men Dahmer is known to have murdered. On Saturday, Hagen criticized the new walking tour as an attempt to make money by turning her brother's murder into macabre entertainment.
 "This whole thing opens up a lot of old wounds, a lot of painful memories," Hagen said while holding a sign calling tour organizer Bam Media and Marketing heartless. "It's that same hurt all over again."
Tour guide Nicholas Vollmann wasn't dissuaded. "The protests are not likely to continue," he said.
Dahmer, a chocolate factory worker, spent years frequenting Milwaukee area gay bars. He was arrested in 1991 and admitted to killing 17 young men, some of whom he mutilated and cannibalized. He was serving life prison sentences when a fellow inmate beat him to death in 1994.

14 hurt in shootoutat Tempe nightclub
Tempe police made one arrest and were looking for two other suspects after a shootout amid a large crowd outside an Arizona nightclub left more than a dozen people wounded and set off a chaotic scene as the injured screamed for help and hundreds tried to flee.
None of those wounded in the Friday shooting had life-threatening injuries, police spokesman Lt. Mike Horn said. 
 The man in custody is one of three who opened fire at one another after they began arguing as a crowd of at least 250 people lined up outside the Clubhouse Music Venue for a hip-hop show, Horn said. 
Horn said all three are believed to be affiliated with Phoenix area gangs.

NEW Jersey

Muslims, AG talk about NYPD actions
The state's attorney general told Muslim leaders Saturday that he was still looking into the extent of New York Police Department surveillance operations in the state, yet stopped short of promising a formal investigation.
Leaders from New Jersey Muslim organizations met with Attorney General Jeffrey Chiesa and state and federal law enforcement officials for nearly three hours in Trenton to discuss concerns over the police department's activities in the state.
Meanwhile, New York City Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly again defended his department's operations in a speech Saturday at the Fordham Law School in Manhattan, as about 60 protesters marched outside.
At the New Jersey meeting, several attendees said Chiesa told them during the private session that he was still reviewing what legal jurisdiction New Jersey law enforcement officials might have over NYPD operations in the state, before taking any formal action.
New Jersey's Muslim leaders have been demanding at least a state investigation - if not a federal one - into the NYPD's activities following a series of stories by the Associated Press that detailed the monitoring or recommended surveillance of Muslims in New Jersey, the mapping of mosques in Newark and the monitoring of Muslim student groups, including at Rutgers University and at other schools in the Northeast.

'My God, what a slaughter'

BYLINE: Steve Vogel

SECTION: SPECIAL NEWS; Pg. Q10

LENGTH: 1874 words

The hardened armies that would meet at the Second Battle of Manassas in late August 1862 had none of the naive enthusiasm of the men who a year earlier had joyously marched to the fields around Bull Run for a battle they believed would put a quick end to the young war between the states.
If the stunning Confederate victory at First Manassas in July 1861 had shown that a long, hard road lay ahead in this war, Second Manassas would show how bloody it would be.
The nation had been shocked by the toll at the First Battle of Manassas, which saw more than 5,000 casualties, including nearly 900 dead - the bloodiest battle in American history, to that point. 
But as the Civil War stretched into its second year, the battles had become deadlier. The armies had grown much larger, the officers more competent, their tactics more proficient. The weapons were deadlier - more rifles with better accuracy and more precise artillery. As much as anything, it was this: The men had become expert at killing and remorseless about it.
In the western theater in April, Union troops under Gen. Ulysses S. Grant clashed with a large Confederate force at Shiloh, leaving more than 20,000 casualties, an unprecedented number. That grim mark was about to be matched on the familiar swales of farmland around Bull Run, 26 miles west of Washington.

'An ungovernable mob'
In the summer of 1862, as Union Gen. George McClellan's Peninsula Campaign bogged down in front of Richmond, President Abraham Lincoln pinned his hopes on another commander who might bring victory. Gen. John Pope, who had achieved modest success in the west, was given command of the newly created Army of Virginia.
Pope quickly earned the enmity of his new army in his first address to the troops when he snidely suggested they lacked the courage of the western soldiers. But Pope had something McClellan lacked: an aggressive streak. The new commander was determined to seek out and destroy the Confederate Army.
In early August, McClellan was ordered to send his troops to Northern Virginia, where they would unite with Pope's army and create an overwhelming force that could crush Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. But McClellan, jealous of Pope's new prominence, delayed his departure for 10 days.
In the division of the Union armies, Lee saw opportunity. Lee would defeat Pope before he could be reinforced.
After several weeks of maneuvering, Lee's and Pope's armies were poised across from each other on opposite sides of the Rappahannock River. Lee developed a bold plan to split his own army.
Gen. Thomas J. "Stonewall" Jackson - his nickname earned by his tenacious stand at First Manassas - would take one wing around Pope's right flank to get behind the enemy. The second wing, under Gen. James Longstreet, would stay at Pope's front - but not for long. Once Pope turned his troops around to chase Jackson, Lee and Longstreet would follow Jackson's path to reunite the army and try to inflict a decisive defeat on the Union force. The Confederate plan carried great risk, presenting Pope with an opportunity to destroy each wing of Lee's army in succession.
On Aug. 25, Jackson launched his 24,000 men on one of the war's great marches, covering more than 50 miles in 34 hours. At dawn Aug. 26, his lead elements passed through the Bull Run Mountains at Thoroughfare Gap and into the rear of Pope's army.
Jackson had an open path to Manassas Junction, the critical railroad hub that gave the ground around Bull Run such strategic importance. Jackson's men, lean, hungry and wide-eyed, fell upon an enormous, undefended federal depot, with warehouses and boxcars filled with rations, helping themselves to cigars and whiskey and wolfing down lobster accompanied by Rhine wine.
"Just imagine about 6000 men hungry and almost naked, let loose on some million dollars worth of biscuit, cheese, ham, bacon, messpork, coffee, sugar, tea, fruit, brandy, wine, whiskey, oysters, coats, pants, shirts, caps, boots, shoes, blankets, tents, etc.," wrote a horrified chaplain from Louisiana. "I saw the whole army become what appeared to me an ungovernable mob."
Union Brig. Gen. George Taylor led more than 1,000 New Jersey troops to the scene, confidently expecting to scatter some Confederate raiders. Instead, they met an explosion of fire from Jackson's army. A quarter of the Union men were lost, and the mortally wounded Taylor urged his officers "for God's sake to prevent another Bull Run."
Pope saw no such danger. He withdrew his 66,000-man army from the Rappahannock and sent them northeast to hunt down Jackson's army. "We shall bag the whole crowd," he declared.
But Jackson was not trapped or trying to escape, as Pope assumed. He moved a few miles northwest and took up a strong position on Stony Ridge, hidden in woods above the Warrenton Turnpike - modern-day Route 29 - along the likely avenue of Union approach. Late in the day, Aug. 28, a Federal column came marching east on the turnpike, in front of his concealed troops.
To the horror of his staff, Jackson rode across broom sedge fields to within musket range of the passing Union troops, who paid no mind to the lone rider. Satisfied that a large Federal force was within his sights, Jackson rode back to the Confederate line and issued orders to his officers: "Bring out your men, gentlemen."
The ensuing fight at Brawner's Farm - which marked the beginning of Second Manassas - was one of the most brutal of the war. It pitted one of the best Union units - Wisconsin and Indiana troops soon known as the Iron Brigade - against the most storied Confederate outfit: the Stonewall Brigade.
Moving up the slope into withering fire, the Union troops almost overran the Confederates, but when the fighting stopped after dark, the Federals had been held off. Almost one-third of the troops engaged had been killed or wounded in the bloody standoff.
"My God, what a slaughter," wrote Pvt. George Fairfield of the 7th Wisconsin.
But worse was to come.

'Like chaff before the tempest'
On the morning of Aug. 29, Jackson placed his troops along a stretch of unfinished rail bed roughly parallel to the turnpike, a well-protected position. Despite the heavy losses, Jackson was sanguine. He knew Longstreet was on his way.
Several times, the Union troops briefly breached the Confederate line, but each time they were pushed back. By the end of the day, four massive but disjointed Union assaults had failed to break through Jackson's left flank, leaving bodies piled before the railroad bank.
"My brave lads were dashed back before the storm of bullets like chaff before the tempest," reported Brig. Gen. Robert Milroy, a Union brigade commander.
An even greater danger lay off Pope's exposed left flank, where Longstreet's wing was taking position, leaving the Union army squeezed inside a giant vise.
Night fell and fighting ended for the day with Pope still unconcerned about the threat, despite warnings from commanders in the field.
Behind Confederate lines, Jackson listened to a lengthy casualty report without comment. Some believed the general was beyond remorse a year into the war. But when surgeon Hunter H. McGuire disclosed that among the dead was 19-year-old Willie Preston, the gentle-natured son of close friends from Lexington, Jackson's muscles twitched and his eyes glowed. "He gripped me by the shoulder till it hurt me, and in a savage, threatening manner asked why I left the boy," McGuire recalled. "In a few seconds he recovered himself, and turned and walked off into the woods alone."

Hurling rocks at Union troops
Saturday, Aug. 30, the final day of the battle, dawned hot, dry and quiet. Though Pope had finally recognized Longstreet's arrival, he ignored the threat and prepared to attack. He sent a wire to Washington reporting the enemy had been "driven from the field" and his expectation that a glorious victory was at hand.
It was almost 3 p.m. when a single Union cannon fired a shot, the attack signal for 12,000 Union soldiers in 37 regiments, lined up in assault formation that stretched more than a mile. In the desperate close-quarters fighting that ensued along the railroad bank, Confederates who had expended all of their ammunition were reduced to hurling rocks at the Union troops.
With his entire line in danger, Jackson sent a message to Lee asking for reinforcements. Now Longstreet opened up with 18 cannons sighted on the open ground where the Federals were advancing. Next he unleashed his five divisions, 25,000 soldiers, stretching nearly a mile and a half. It was the largest single mass assault of the war. With frightful screams, the rebel troops swept forward through fields, streams and woods.
Two New York regiments of Zouaves, who wore gaudy uniforms with baggy red trousers and tasseled fezzes modeled after the French, were the first to pay the price, overrun by Gen. John Bell Hood's Texans. In 10 minutes, the 5th New York lost more men than any regiment would in any other battle of the war - 124 killed and 223 wounded out of 490. To one of Hood's men, the bodies of the Zouaves sprinkled across the slope gave the appearance of "a Texas hillside when carpeted in the spring by wild flowers of many hues and tints."
At last, Pope grasped his ghastly miscalculation and rushed to save his army. He sent troops to occupy the strategic high ground at Henry Hill. A brigade of Ohioans, reinforced by artillery and followed by others, bought time for their comrades with a stand on Chinn Ridge, which lay between Henry Hill and the advancing Confederates. They slowed the Confederate advance, buying 90 precious minutes, but at fearful cost.
Capt. Mark Kern, the commander of a Pennsylvania battery, was one of many who sacrificed his life. "I promised to drive you back, or die under my guns, and I have kept my word," he told the Texans.
Henry Hill was secured, enabling Pope's army to retreat in darkness across Bull Run and eventually to the safety of Washington's fortifications.
"We are whipped again, I am afraid," Lincoln sadly told his secretary, John Hay.
Second Manassas left 3,300 dead, more Americans than have died in a decade of war in Afghanistan. Although it lies just minutes from Interstate 66, the rolling landscape of Manassas National Battlefield Park has a peaceful beauty far removed from 150 years ago, when the mangled and bloody remains of thousands of young men lay in fields and streambeds, on hill slopes and in piles at the foot of the unfinished railroad grade.
Never again would Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia come so close to destroying a Federal army as it did at Second Manassas. 
But the Federal army had escaped, and within days, Lee made the fateful decision to invade Maryland. Less than three weeks later, his troops would meet the Union army at Antietam, where a sad new standard of American bloodshed would be set.

CORRECTION: In the Civil War 150 section published March 4, a photograph with a listing of events and commemorations was accompanied by an incorrect caption that described it as a sketch from an exhibit.

Shot at Big East double bye lost in Hoyas' finale

DATELINE: MILWAUKEE

MILWAUKEE - TheGeorgetown men's basketball team arrived at Bradley Center on Saturday afternoon with an opportunity to earn a second-place finish in the Big East standings and, more important, a chance to claim a coveted double bye in the conference tournament. 
By the time the 11th-ranked Hoyas trudged off Marquette's home floor, though, they had slipped all the way to the No. 5 seed following an 83-69 loss to the eighth-ranked Golden Eagles. As a result, Georgetown must settle for only one bye and will open next week's tournament at Madison Square Garden in the second round rather than the quarterfinals.  
Even as it became apparent that there wouldn't be another scintillating comeback for the Hoyas (22-7, 12-6) against Marquette, they had a chance to back into fourth place and a double bye. But Cincinnati's 72-68 victory at Villanova gave the Bearcats (22-9, 12-6) the final pass to Thursday's quarterfinals by virtue of tiebreakers. (Cincinnati's win over the Hoyas on Jan. 9 was the ultimate difference.)
"In life, you have to control what you can control. We came into here with the opportunity to control where we finished. We didn't do what were supposed to do," Coach John Thompson III. "So we end up playing on Wednesday instead of Thursday."
In the teams' first meeting this season, Georgetown rallied from a 17-point second-half deficit and pulled out a 73-70 victory at Verizon Center. On Saturday, the Hoyas again found themselves down 17 points after halftime.
This time, however, Marquette forward Jae Crowder and guard Darius Johnson-Odomensured history would not repeat on their Senior Day. Crowder scored 26 points and grabbed 14 rebounds, while Johnson-Odom had 17 points in front of 19,087, the season's largest crowd.
"He was all over the place," Hoyas freshman Otto Porter said of Crowder, who has averaged 24.6 points per game the past six contests. "We had a lot of mix-ups [on defense] and our communication wasn't there today. It all comes down to communication." 
Porter finished with a career-high 19 points, matching junior Hollis Thompson's offensive output. But it wasn't enough to compensate for the Hoyas' struggles on defense - in the paint and in transition - or at the free throw line. 
Georgetown won its previous two games with defense, limiting Villanova and Notre Dame to 28 and 33.3 percent shooting, respectively. Marquette (25-6, 14-4) shot 48 percent, and the Golden Eagles' point total marked the most the Hoyas yielded in conference play. They also scored 40 points in the paint and 18 off fast breaks. 
The Hoyas didn't help themselves at the free throw line, either. They missed 11 of their 25 attempts, including seven of their 13 shots in a first half that ended with Marquette leading, 39-29. The Hoyas' free throw percentage - 56 - was their worst this season.
"It killed us," John Thompson said. "It was front ends and that can't happen. It can't happen this time of year if we want to win."
Senior Jason Clark added: "We just need to get in the gym and shoot more foul shots. They haven't been falling lately. We have to do a better job of getting better at shooting free throws."
Thompson also took issue with his team's shot selection, particularly in the first half.
"That," he said, "was probably at the root of everything."
Marquette's biggest lead was 48-31 after a an alley-oop dunk by Jamil Wilson, who was assessed a technical foul for hanging on the rim with 17 minutes 55 seconds remaining in a disjointed game in which the Golden Eagles attempted 20 more free throws than Georgetown. 
The Hoyas cut their deficit to eight points on three occasions, the final time coming on a layup by Thompson with 2:24 remaining. But 73-65 was as close as they could get, as Marquette scored seven of the game's next nine points. 
As disappointed as Thompson was in his team's performance, he also considered it a lesson, given what the Hoyas will face in the coming weeks.
"It's a lesson that's got to be learned," he said. "The playoffs started today. Fortunately, unlike the NCAA tournament, it doesn't mean the season is over. [But] we have to do a lot of things differently as we go forward."

State repeals limit on handgun purchases
Virginia Gov. Robert F. McDonnell (R) signed legislation Tuesday to repeal the state's one-per-month limit on handgun purchases, lifting a 19-year-old cap put in place when the state was a notorious supplier to gun-traffickers along the East Coast.
Pro-gun lawmakers have tried for years to eliminate the one-per-month cap on handgun purchases, imposed in 1993 under Gov. L. Douglas Wilder (D). 
Bills to that effect have passed the House in previous years but always died in Senate committees and subcommittees at the hands of Democrats and moderate Republicans. This year's bill had no such trouble, given the presence of more conservative Republicans in the evenly divided Senate.
McDonnell, who voted for the purchase limit as a delegate but campaigned for governor on a promise to overturn it, signed the bill just days after participating in a conference call with relatives of those affected by the 2007 mass shooting at Virginia Tech. The relatives had urged McDonnell not to sign the bill.
"He said, 'I have a duty to protect the Second Amendment,' " said Lori Haas, a gun-control activist who was on the call. Her daughter was injured during the Virginia Tech shooting. "The governor's number one duty is to keep the citizens of Virginia safe. . . . Expanding the ease with which criminals can get guns is certainly not going to keep Virginians safe."
The bill's supporters said that the limit was no longer needed now that gun buyers get  background checks.
"It's a law that should never been on the books, and we're obviously happy to see it go," said Philip Van Cleave, president of the Virginia Citizens Defense League.
Advocates of the repeal also contended that so many exceptions had been made to the law that it was essentially meaningless. Over the years, the law had been changed to exempt law-enforcement officials and people with concealed-weapons permits. If collectors anticipated picking up several firearms at gun or antiques shows, they could simply apply to the state police for a permit exempting them from the cap for seven days.

Post-mammography information bill signed
Gov. Robert F. McDonnell (R) has signed a bill requiring that radiologists provide information about breast density in post-mammogram letters to patients.
The measure goes into effect July 1.
State legislators passed the legislation after learning that mammograms miss about 40 percent of cancers in women with dense breast tissue. Other imaging techniques, such as MRIs and ultrasounds, can detect some tumors in dense tissue better than mammograms, but those tests have shortcomings, as well.
The bill was met with behind-the-scenes resistance from radiologists who were concerned that women would be unduly alarmed, turned off from life saving mammograms and left footing the bill for unnecessary and expensive tests. They succeeded in changing the proposed language so that it would alert women to density but not suggest that they seek other tests.

Police arrest electronics thievery suspects

BYLINE: Martin Weil

SECTION: METRO; Pg. C03

LENGTH: 244 words

A thief grabbed someone's iPad in a Metro train Tuesday night and ran out the train's door. On Capitol Hill earlier the same day, armed robbers took both an iPhone and an iPad.  
Police said they made arrests in both cases, which came at a time of heightened concern about robberies in general and about thefts of small, expensive electronic devices in particular. 
In the first incident, which occurred about 8 p.m. at the Rhode Island Avenue station on the Red Line, police said the thief was stopped amid commotion at the station by a member of the Guardian Angels, a civilian anticrime group. But someone who apparently was accompanying the thief yanked him - and the iPad - free from the hands of the volunteer. 
Police said the thief and his associate then headed for a nearby shopping center, with the theft victim and the Guardian Angel on their heels. Police said they made two arrests.
The earlier Tuesday incident occurred about 1 p.m. after someone got off a Metrobus at Eighth Street and Maryland Avenue NE. Several people who had been on the same bus apparently followed. In a D Street alley, one robber showed a gun and one a knife. They took the iPhone and iPad and fled, police said. 
Police said they arrested two men Wednesday and charged them with robbery. 
Also Tuesday, police said an iPad was grabbed from someone's hand in the 700 block of 11th Street NW in the heart of downtown about 7 p.m. Police said they arrested a man nearby.

The Monitor's secrets

BYLINE: Michael E. Ruane

SECTION: SPECIAL NEWS; Pg. Q09

LENGTH: 2205 words

One sailor remembered that the clouds parted late that night and an eerie half-moon illuminated the ship's death struggle in the Atlantic gale. ֲ¶ Towering waves broke over the turret. Water gushed through the hatches and knocked men down. Several were swept overboard and vanished into the blackness. ֲ¶ Below deck, the rising water sloshed almost waist deep. Several members of the crew were paralyzed by seasickness or fear. And a master's mate gave a watch away, sensing his doom. ֲ¶ It was a "panorama of horror," a survivor recalled, one that "would have appalled the stoutest heart."  ֲ¶ And as the USS Monitor was pounded by the ocean, the skipper signaled to his escort ship to send the lifeboats: He was sinking. ֲ¶ It was Dec. 31, 1862, and as the moon set over the North Carolina coast, the strange iron-covered vessel - the ship that had so recently saved the Union - vanished, leaving behind only an eddy on the surface. ֲ¶ The engine room clock was later found stopped at around 1 a.m., marking the moment of one of the great naval tragedies of the Civil War.

A battle for the ages
 Ten months earlier - 150 years ago this week - the Monitor had become the nation's salvation and had altered the course of the war. 
Armed with only two guns and powered by a single-cylinder engine, the vessel steamed into Virginia's Hampton Roads and interrupted the destruction of a Union flotilla by a powerful iron-clad Confederate warship.
The Confederate vessel, the CSS Virginia, had rampaged among the Union's wooden ships on March 8, as Yankee shots bounced off its greased iron sides. 
One Union warship was rammed and sunk. Another was set ablaze and surrendered. A third was heavily damaged. More than 200 Union sailors were killed. 
It was the worst defeat in U.S. naval history up to that time, according to John D. Broadwater, a longtime Monitor scholar. And it threatened to break the Union's crucial naval blockade of the South. 
Fear of the rebel war machine - "the horrid creature of a nightmare" - reached as far away as Washington, where it was hourly expected to steam up the Potomac, shell the Capitol and scatter Congress.
It made for a fearsome sight, with its slanted black silhouette, menacing guns and smoke billowing from its stack.
Adding insult to apprehension, it had been built on the burned remains of a U.S. Navy ship, the Merrimack, which the Navy thought it had destroyed.
But the next day, March 9, as the Virginia returned to finish off the Union ships, the Monitor, which had arrived the night before, steamed out to give battle.
As 20,000 spectators watched from shore and other ships, one of history's most important naval engagements unfolded.
The Monitor was an almost laughable contrast, with a deck just above the waterline and a solitary revolving iron turret - a "cheesebox," as the reporters would call it.
The Virginia outgunned the Monitor, with 10 weapons firing from ports in its blockhouse on deck.
But the Monitor's twin eight-ton smoothbores were bigger, and the spinning turret allowed the guns to be fired without maneuvering the ship into shooting position.
Both ships had mechanical problems. Neither could do the other much damage. And the slugfest, which went on for four hours, ended in a draw.
The encounter - the first ever between ironclad warships - changed naval warfare forever.
"There will be other battles," novelist Nathaniel Hawthorne later wrote, "but no more such tests of seamanship and manhood as the battles of the past." 
The age of the wooden warship was over. But the future of the Union was preserved.
The Monitor and its crew became national heroes. The ship was swarmed with visitors who begged crew members for autographs. One woman, given a tour, kissed the guns. 
An emotional President Abraham Lincoln went aboard and reviewed the assembled crew, hat in hand.
 But before the year was out, the celebrated Monitor would blunder into the gale 16 miles off Cape Hatteras and sink in 220 feet of water. 
Sixteen men were lost, including two who were entangled in the ropes, guns and coal that piled into the turret when the vessel capsized.
One of the survivors later described the disaster to his wife, saying: "The Monitor is no more. What the fire of the enemy failed to do, the elements have accomplished." 

The past, reconstructed
But the death of the Monitor also led to a modern maritime saga as bold, ingenious and improbable as the life of the pioneering warship.
Lost for more than a century, the ship was located by scientists in 1973, upside down but mostly intact just off Cape Hatteras.
(The Virginia was blown up in Hampton Roads in 1862 to keep it out of the hands of encroaching Yankees. Little of the ship has ever been found.) 
In 2002, the Monitor's 120-ton turret - its guns still inside - was lifted to the surface with the help of the Navy and taken to the Maritime Museum in Newport News, Va., for preservation. 
The museum has the state-of-the art Monitor Center for the display and conservation of the ship's artifacts. 
Scientists have also recovered the ship's 20-ton engine, its anchor, sailors' shoes, a boot, part of a wool coat, silverware, rubber buttons, lanterns, the engine room clock and the skull of a rodent.
And they found the almost complete skeletons of the two sailors who were trapped in the turret.
Last month, forensic technicians at Louisiana State University, working for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, began trying to re-create their faces.
Using exact models of the two skulls, the scientists applied clay to try to reconstruct how the sailors might have looked.
One was a younger man, about 21, whose skull showed that he had suffered a broken nose and whose feet were still clad in a pair of beat-up, mismatched shoes.  
The other was that of an older salt, about 35, whose bones showed that he may have had a limp from an earlier injury.
He also had a groove in his left front teeth, probably from clenching his pipe. And he wore a gold ring with a crude swirling pattern on a finger of his right hand.
 The complete reconstructions are scheduled to be unveiled this week at the Navy Memorial in Washington.
Experts have also extracted DNA, studied the skeletons - which are in a military laboratory in Hawaii - and narrowed down to a few the possible identities of the two. 
And although both remain officially unidentified, NOAA experts believe that the current sesquicentennial of the Civil War is a perfect time for the two sailors to be buried with honors at Arlington National Cemetery. 
"Let's put these two men to rest . . . as a group burial representing all of the men who lost their lives that night," said David W. Alberg, superintendent of NOAA's Monitor Marine Sanctuary. "These men belong to history and the nation, and it's time that the nation honors them." 

A crash construction job 
The day that changed naval warfare began shortly after sunrise as the Monitor steamed out of the shadow of the USS Minnesota, one of the Union ships battered by the Virginia the day before.
The Monitor's bespectacled paymaster, William F. Keeler, was on deck with the ship's commander and a doctor. Keeler spotted the Virginia in the distance through the morning fog.
Suddenly a puff of smoke appeared from the Virginia, and a shell shrieked overhead,  crashing into the wounded Minnesota.
"Gentlemen," said the Monitor's commander, Lt. John L. Worden, "you had better go below."
Keeler later wrote his wife: "We did not wait [for] a second invitation."
He recalled that as the trio descended into the turret, and the hatch was closed, crewmen were hoisting a 175-pound shot into one of the guns. "Send them that with our compliments, my lads," Worden ordered.
The scene seems like one from a World War II submarine movie rather than one from the Civil War. That was because the Monitor looked like, and was in many respects, "a submerged iron fortress," as Hawthorne called it. "She burrows and snorts along, oftener under the surface than above."
The ship had been built in Brooklyn during a crash construction program after Union  officials discovered that the Confederacy was rebuilding the Merrimack.
When Virginia seceded from the Union in 1861, the U.S. Navy was forced to abandon its venerable Gosport shipyard in Portsmouth. Departing Union officers tried to destroy anything that might be of use to the rebels. 
That included the USS Merrimack, a large steam- and sail-powered frigate that was in for repairs.
But the Merrimack was only partly destroyed. And the ingenious Confederates, eager for a weapon to counter Union naval power, salvaged its hull and engine, and built on its deck the iron- and timber-covered blockhouse.
Informed about the Virginia, Washington frantically sought its own ironclad, even advertising in newspapers for "Iron-Clad Steam-Vessels-of-War."
The Navy was directed to the imperious John Ericsson, a Swedish-born, New York-based ship architect who seven years before had pitched the French a Monitor-like vessel called "Ericsson's Impregnable Battery and Revolving Cupola." 
Although the French did not take up his offer, Ericsson wrote later that he "was fully prepared to present plans of an impregnable steam battery" to Washington.
And the Navy did not have much time. Although his design was alien - "like nothing in the heaven above or on the earth beneath," one officer said - Ericsson got the contract on Oct. 4, 1861.
He was given 100 days to deliver the ship. 
Much of the work was subcontracted. The Navy borrowed two guns from another vessel. Ericsson supplied the cutting-edge technology and design.
Most of the Monitor rode below the surface, which made it a small target. Its deck rose only 18 inches above the waterline. Indeed, the Monitor was so strange a ship that several sailors deserted on being assigned to it, according to historian John V. Quarstein, who has authored a study of the crew, "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1596294558?ie=UTF8&tag=washpost-books-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=1789&creativeASIN=1596294558-URL-The Monitor Boys."
The ship used a single four-blade propeller, and an unusual four-pronged anchor that was carried and deployed internally to avoid exposing the crew to gunfire.
The Monitor had a surprisingly elegant interior, and the world's first on-board toilets that could be flushed underwater - although they would backfire if not operated properly.
The guns had special brakes to reduce recoil in the confines of the turret. And the turret was sheathed in eight layers of thick iron plate.
Ericsson pushed the construction, visiting the shipyard almost every day. And when the Monitor was launched on Jan. 30, 1862, he had missed his deadline by only 18 days.

The crew, up close
 Four months after the battle at Hampton Roads, a photographer named James F. Gibson hauled his camera equipment aboard the Monitor while it was anchored in the James River and took the only known images of the crew.
In the photos, groups of sailors congregate on the sun-baked deck, and officers pose with the Monitor's dented turret in the background. 
The sailors are a weathered-looking, sinewy bunch.
 In one shot, several are in bare feet. Two are smoking pipes. There are what seem to be two games of checkers underway. One sailor, wearing a Navy tam, is intently reading what may be a newspaper.
In another shot, crewmen lounge while pots cook over a deck oven. Atop the turret, a crewman stands holding a spyglass.
The Monitor had a complement of 58 men during the battle and 63 when it sank, according to Anna Holloway, vice president of the Mariners' Museum's collections and programs. 
There were coal heavers, boilermakers, former slaves, natives of Germany, Ireland, Scotland, Sweden and Wales. One had his initials tattooed on his right forearm. Another was the son of a Union general. Several enlisted under false names. 
Two members of the crew, including an officer who was haunted by criticism of his performance at Hampton Roads, would later take their own lives.
Most of those aboard escaped in lifeboats the night the Monitor sank.
Among those who perished was acting master's mate George Frederickson of Philadelphia, who had given a friend a pocket watch, saying, "Here, this is yours. I may be lost."
Frederickson is pictured in two of Gibson's photos of the crew - a short man with a thick goatee and an intense look on his face.
Near Frederickson in both photos is the boyish third assistant engineer Robinson W. Hands, who wears his cap at a jaunty angle and, in one shot, holds a cigar. He, too, died. 
Also lost was engineer Samuel Augee Lewis, who was last seen seasick in his bunk. He had called out to a comrade: "Is there any hope?"
Almost a century and a half later, curators found in the rusted turret silverware bearing   the initials "S A L" inscribed above the letters "USN."

Technology and mayhem

It was the war of the future, and it was the war of the past. The combination was brutal, a recipe for slaughter. ֲ¶ The Civil War brought into existence new techniques of killing even as generals followed the tactics of the Napoleonic wars. The rifled guns, exploiting the physics of a spinning bullet, were far more accurate, and an infantryman could drop an enemy soldier hundreds of yards away. ֲ¶ The Gatling gun introduced the world to the concept of a machine gun. Now came, too, the trench warfare, the land mines, the sea mines. The spring of 1862 saw the famous battle of the ironclads, the CSS Virginia vs. the USS Monitor. The railroads, a young technology, enabled the rapid transport and resupply of vast armies.
 The rise of American industry in the first half of the century meant factories could mass-produce clothes, boots, weapons. Telegraph lines enabled commanders to direct armies over multiple theaters. The wires carried bulletins from the front lines to distant newspaper presses. The public followed every battle, and, thus, the grand strategy of war had to factor in the shifts in public opinion - the perception of the war in the North, the South and across the Atlantic, where the traditional Great Powers weighed their options. 
And yet as modern and fantastic as it was, there was still something medieval about the Civil War. Soldiers fought with bayonets and carried swords to battle. Their weapons included lances and pikes. They relied on horses, mules, wagons. Medicine remained borderline barbaric. Amputations were conducted on the battlefield without anesthesia, and soldiers died in droves not of combat injuries but of ancient diseases - hewing to a grand tradition of warfare.  
Wars are always a product of current technology and past strategy. The Civil War was to some extent the first industrial-age war, says historian Bart Hacker of the National Museum of American History. But it was also the last of the preindustrial wars, he says. A conference this fall at the Smithsonian, organized by Hacker, will seek to sort it out. 
One of the most important innovations was one that no one could see directly. As Robert V. Bruce reports in his book http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0252060903?ie=UTF8&tag=washpost-books-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=1789&creativeASIN=0252060903-URL-"Lincoln and the Tools of War," ordnance officers at the start of the Civil War had at their disposal a huge stockpile of smoothbore weapons. Such guns fired a round bullet that tended to tumble through the air, destination never entirely certain. 
But there was a better technology in the wings. It wasn't new (Lincoln knew all about it from his days on the frontier), but it hadn't been widely adopted by militaries: the rifle.
A "rifled" gun has spiraling grooves (rifling) inside the bore. The grooves impart a spin to  an elongated bullet, making it fly much farther. 
The drawback with rifles had always been that they were hard to load at the muzzle, because the bullet had to fit tightly in order to benefit from the rifling. Soldiers labored to cram the bullet down the bore. 
But as the war neared, technology found better ways to load and fire a weapon. For example, the Minie ball had become popular with the War Department. Named for the  Frenchman who invented it, the small, easy-loading Minie ball had a concave base that would expand under the force of the exploding gunpowder, enabling it to take the rifling and spin. 
Gradually, rifled weapons replaced smoothbore guns, and soldiers could inflict death at a distance, which vastly expanded the killing ground between opposing lines. 
"Instead of a couple hundred yards, you're talking about crossing 1,000 yards under fire," said Hacker, a curator of armed forces history. "You're just taking a whole lot more fire - and, in general, more accurate fire. You could actually hit something you aimed at several hundred yards away with a rifle musket. With a smoothbore, you were lucky to hit your target beyond 50 yards."
The generals had learned their craft at West Point, where they had read Antoine-Henri Jomini's theories on the science of warfare. They knew about the importance of the turning maneuver and of interior lines of supply and communication. They learned the virtues of concentrating forces and sending masses of men into the enemy's weakest point. This was the Napoleonic orthodoxy. But in practice in the Civil War it could be  suicide. 
The masses of men charged into a meat grinder.

Lincoln was keenly aware that he lived in a technological society. He was a modern man, knifing into the future. He experienced the acceleration of technological progress more than most Americans because of the primitive nature of his birth in a log cabin on the frontier.
The telegraph came along in 1844, and information suddenly no longer moved at the speed of a horse. Since earlier in the century, the ancient sources of power - wind, water, human and animal muscle - had been to a great extent supplanted by the miracle of steam. Lincoln saw these changes and approved. He was a technophile, curious about contraptions, a student of machines. He became a promoter of railroads and an eager user of the telegraph.  
He was even an inventor himself. He owned a U.S. government patent, which no other president before or since could boast. He had designed a mechanism for assisting a boat across shoals. He was quite obsessed with the importance of what people called "internal improvements," meaning the building of roads, railroads, canals, harbors. He once told his best friend, Joshua Speed, that he wanted someday to be the DeWitt Clinton of Illinois - Clinton being the New Yorker behind the Erie Canal. 
 By 1858, the year of the laying of the first transatlantic telegraph cable, Lincoln had developed a traveling lecture about the history of technology. 
"Man is not the only animal who labors; but he is the only one who improves his workmanship," Lincoln declared in his lecture on "Discoveries and Inventions."
As president, he was technologist-in-chief. Inventors banged on his door, wrote him letters, begged him for investment capital for their new weapons. "People knew that Lincoln was a technology geek," says curator David Miller, who works in the gun room at the American History museum. Lincoln would test-fire rifles sent to the White House.
The telegraph office was Lincoln's second home, and he would linger late into the night, hectoring generals to pursue the enemy. A president who controlled multiple theaters of war through the clipped diction of the telegraph mastered the art of the compressed message, which may help explain why the Gettysburg Address  is not only short but impossible to cut.
Even with the rise of a wired society, information remained sketchy. Entire armies still managed to move undetected behind mountain ranges. Reliable information could be elusive in crucial moments. 

A trip the battlefield 
Consider the story, http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1862/12/oliver-wendell-holmes/8750/-URL-available online at the Atlantic Web site, written in 1862 by Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr., an editor for the (yes, very venerable) magazine. In September of that year he learned, via a telegram delivered to his Boston home, that his son Oliver Jr.  had been wounded in the battle of Antietam. The message went:
 "Hagerstown 17th 
To H 
Capt H wounded shot through the neck thought not mortal at Keedysville"
Holmes sets out to find his son. The narrative is extraordinarily long and digressive, and at times it feels like a shaggy dog story, but it offers a great deal of texture of American life in 1862 across a variety of landscapes.
Holmes, for example, opines about what a nuisance it is to have an overly talkative neighbor during a train ride. It's a comment that easily could have been written in the 21st century rather than the 19th. 
Out the window, he sees canal boats, and for a moment, he dreams of being the captain of one, enjoying a tranquil, prelapsarian existence - "who has not often envied the cobbler in his stall?" This is the lament of the overly busy modern person. 
After much travel, Holmes reaches the Monocacy River, but the rebels have blown up the railroad bridge. He must switch to a horse-drawn wagon. Such is life in a between age: The pre-industrial past is never far away.
He eventually makes his way to the scene of the great battle:
"The whole ground was strewed with fragments of clothing, haversacks, canteens, cap-boxes, bullets, cartridge-boxes, cartridges, scraps of paper, portions of bread and meat. I saw two soldiers' caps that looked as though their owners had been shot through the head. In several places I noted dark red patches where a pool of blood had curdled and caked, as some poor fellow poured his life out on the sod."
He can't find his wounded son. He hears all kinds of rumors. He retraces his route, all the way back to Philadelphia, and still can't find him. He goes to Harrisburg, Pa., and still can't find him. It turns out (eventually, many thousands of words later, when they finally reunite in Harrisburg) that his son had been holed up in Hagerstown, under the care of some angelic women, just 10 miles from the Antietam battlefield when his father visited. 
And, thus, one sees the frustrations of life in a partially technological world. Information isn't reliable. Everyone is still a little lost. You can't find your wounded son to save your life.
We know how the narrative turns out, because Oliver Jr. goes on to become a celebrated Supreme Court justice. He lives to the age of 93. 
But no one in 1862 knew how the terrible drama of the Civil War would play out. And they didn't realize that they were nowhere near the end of the story.

Al-Qaeda forces invade military base in Yemen

BYLINE: Ahmed al-Haj

LENGTH: 410 words

DATELINE: SANAA, YEMEN

SANAA, Yemen - Al-Qaeda militants overran an army base in southern Yemen on Sunday, capturing heavy weapons and turning them on soldiers in intense clashes that left 61 dead, a military official said. 
The battle near the town of Zinjibar in the southern province of Abyan killed 36 government troops and 25 militants, he said. A medical official confirmed the death toll. Scores were wounded from both sides, the officials said. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media.
The military official said the fighting was taking place west of Zinjibar, the provincial capital. Militants seized control of the town in May, taking advantage of political turmoil linked to the uprising against then-President Ali Abdullah Saleh.
Saleh stepped down last month in a U.S.-backed power-transfer deal that Washington hoped would allow Yemen's new leaders to move against al-Qaeda. But the fighting highlights the difficulties faced by his successor, Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, in combating the militant movement and restoring state authority in the lawless south.
The military officials said the militants were able to seize armored vehicles, artillery pieces, assault rifles and rockets from the stores of an army base they attacked. Some of the heavy weapons were later used against the troops, causing most of the casualties.
A Defense Ministry statement confirmed that the clashes had occurred, saying the fighting began when militants detonated "booby-trapped vehicles" at an army base in the region of Koud near Zinjibar. The wording of the statement suggested that the base had been occupied by the militants before army forces regrouped and took it back.
It said there were casualties on both sides but gave no figures.
Hadi, meanwhile, said in televised comments that fighting al-Qaeda and restoring security in the impoverished Arab nation were among his top priorities. He spoke during a meeting with leaders of Yemen's political parties.
During Saleh's more than 30 years in power, he tolerated radical Islamist groups as part of a delicate balancing act that kept at bay threats to his authority in the fractured nation.
There has been a surge in attacks attributed to al-Qaeda since Hadi's inauguration.
Sunday's fighting followed last week's dismissal by Hadi's government of the military commander of the southern region, to which Abyan belongs, along with other security officials from the province.

'Right Thing' plumbs the depths of addiction

BYLINE: Patrick Anderson

SECTION: STYLE; Pg. C03

LENGTH: 558 words

Dan Barden's novel "The Next Right Thing" didn't lessen my admiration for Alcoholics Anonymous, but it does offer a darker view of AA - at least as seen in one fictional Southern California chapter - than I'd encountered before.
Barden uses a crime story as his vehicle to explore the world of addiction and recovery. His plot is as old as "The Maltese Falcon": a man determined to learn the truth about his friend's death. Randy Chalmers is an ex-cop, an ex-husband and, like the author, a recovering alcoholic. His best friend and AA sponsor, Terry Elias, a lawyer who'd been clean and sober for 15 years, is found dead of a heroin overdose in a seedy motel in Laguna. Randy sets out to learn whether foul play might have been involved.  
Randy is himself given to violence: That's why he's an ex-cop and has an ex-wife who despises him and a girlfriend who's close to leaving him. He charges about questioning, threatening and sometimes slugging people - he's the classic "dry drunk" - and in the process he digs up plenty of dirt. One of his pals in AA is growing marijuana and paying off crooked cops. Another operates a scam that involves renting space in "recovery houses" to recent recruits for inflated prices. Another has been "thirteenth stepping" - AA jargon for seducing vulnerable newcomers to the program, which is considered "scumbag behavior." 
It's a world of anger and hope, friendship and duplicity. We're treated to colorful characters galore - there's DUI Dave, who uses his pants cuff for an ashtray, and the local legend who was stabbed in the head but was too drunk to notice - and pithy phrases, such as the man who's "more than a few fries short of a Happy Meal." In time, Randy learns that Terry, who had desperately wanted a child, was about to become a father, which makes it even harder to understand how he could have turned to heroin. When another of their circle dies under mysterious circumstances, the police suspect Randy. But all this is standard fare in a crime novel. What gives "The Next Right Thing" its special dimension is its relentless portrayal of the addict's life. For example:
"Do you know what it took to get clean and sober after four years of shooting dope in the bathrooms of A.A.?" 
"Terry and I used to talk about that sweet moment of repose after you've almost destroyed your life." 
"Here's another thing you learn in A.A.: when the drunk loses the woman he loves, you know you're not at the end of the story. You know it's going to get much worse." 
"Life for an alcoholic is often a process of discovering all the things that don't make any difference." 
"It's not about deserving or earning or being a good guy. God loves you because that's what God does." 
Barden offers a grim picture of addiction but one that rings true, and he makes clear that he considers AA the last best hope for millions of desperate people. By the end, Randy thinks he knows why and how Terry died, but that knowledge offers little consolation. The novel's final passage is a kind of prayer, as angry as it is loving, that Randy offers to his dead friend. As I put the book down, I wondered whether Barden had a friend whose death inspired those haunting paragraphs. It feels that real.

Arlington private eye is sort of the Bogart of body language

BYLINE: Thomas Heath

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A12

LENGTH: 1103 words

When I think private eye, I think of a tough-talking Humphrey Bogart playing Sam Spade. I think of sleuths, stakeouts, car chases and femmes fatales.
But mild-mannered gumshoe Philip Becnel assures me the job is not that glamorous. The skill set is more akin to a reporter's, requiring good writing and fact-gathering and a knack for getting people to talk.
Becnel, 38, founded and owns Arlington-based Dinolt Becnel & Wells Investigative Group, a boutique private-eye firm that earns a big chunk of its income evaluating people's body language.
He's not getting rich, but Becnel says the job has its moments, just as journalism occasionally does. 
Take the case of the missing mattress, wherein a hotel manager who was fired for stealing a new mattress claimed she was sexually harassed.
Becnel was put on the case. His job was to interview Miss Mattress for a lawyer who was thinking about taking her case. Her darting eyes and delayed answers gave Becnel doubts.
The body-language expert recommended that the lawyer pass on the case.
Then there was the philandering global Fortune 500 chief executive who was making nice with one of his vice presidents. The vice president wanted to sue after the affair cooled and she was demoted.
"We interviewed former employees who had left the company," said Becnel, who worked for a law firm that was thinking about taking the vice president's case. "They corroborated parts of her story" - like the executive's penchant for sending her suggestive e-mails while she was making presentations. "I recommended they take the case," the investigator said.
She got a settlement. The chief executive got a goodbye handshake from his employer.
Becnel, an entrepreneur who has written two books, earns $125,000 in a good year. That includes $50,000 or so in base salary, plus a bunch of the revenue from his share of interviews. Because he owns 100 percent of the company, he can keep any profits or roll them back into the business.
The six-person firm grosses around $500,000 in a good year. In 2010, it grossed $560,000 and closed the books with $90,000 in profits. But last year a law firm that owed him $27,000 went out of business, and Becnel's firm incurred an annual loss of $7,000 on $460,000 in revenue.
Most of his business comes from lawyers who represent clients who want to sue somebody. Because plaintiff's attorneys generally don't get paid unless they win, they need to know whether their would-be client is telling the truth - and whether it will stand up in court.
Most of Becnel's clients arrive through word of mouth, although the firm has a Web site and is on Facebook and Twitter. New clients usually are asked to put up a retainer. Becnel's payroll is just shy of $300,000, and rent is $30,000. He also pays $5,000 for liability insurance.
The George Mason University anthropology major didn't set out be to a private eye. He fell into it.
When a friend quit her job for a firm that performed court-ordered investigations for indigent clients, Becnel stepped in to fill her shoes. He picked up where the woman left off and started closing cases for $10 an hour.
He ventured into risky neighborhoods, tracking down the suspects or witnesses in drug cases and minor felonies. The firm's owner eventually handed over the entire business to Becnel, who has a talent for getting people to chat.
"I'm unassuming, and that sort of Columbo effect played well for me," he said. His interview technique involves keeping an open posture and looking people in the eyes in an open, friendly manner that conveys confidence and gets people to cooperate.
The aspiring novelist said another important skill is the ability to write compelling reports.
"My business is selling reports to clients," he said. "That's what it boils down to. They hire you on the basis of how good your reports are. If they are sloppy and don't reflect what witnesses said, they are of no use. They should be flawless."
Becnel said he concentrates on quotes because they must stand up in court. A witness may say one thing to an investigator but say something else in court, with a judge, jury and room full of onlookers present. The attorney must be able to refer to the interview in case the witness goes wobbly.
Becnel's niche is reading someone's body language and telling whether they are lying.
He is certified in the Reid technique, which is behavior analysis that reads body language. It is commonly used in criminal cases, but Becnel's aha moment was to use it in civil litigation, where he could warn a trial lawyer if his star witness - or even his would-be client - was lying.
He discovered behavior analysis while working on a big sexual harassment case for an employment firm. Attorneys for the plaintiffs had gone ahead with the case based on sworn depositions from a dozen women who said they had been propositioned for sex.
They may have had the witnesses, but a Montgomery County jury didn't believe the plaintiff who was bringing the lawsuit. Becnel's client lost the case - and nearly $100,000 in trial preparation went down the drain.
"Afterwards, I went to the lawyer and said, 'Part of the reason you lost is they didn't believe the woman.' I said, 'I could give you impressions of whether [witnesses] are telling the truth or not,'ג[#x20ac][#x160]" essentially saving the attorney from going down that road again.
The interviews take two to three hours at $150 per hour, and Becnel performs an average of four interviews a week. The interviewer gets $29 an hour, and the rest goes to Becnel's firm to cover salaries and overhead.
The cases typically involve workplace harassment, whistleblowing, sex abuse, or wage and contract disputes. Private investigators licensed in Virginia must take a standard course, which costs about $500. Becnel said he is licensed to carry a gun in the state but rarely does so.
I asked Becnel about problems private investigators face. He said he has so far avoided one of the most common traps: getting emotionally sucked into a case.
"You do a few cases, and you realize that what you thought was a very strong case or very compelling case turned out to have another side of the story you didn't see," he said. "This is not advocacy. You have to take [people's] stories with a grain of salt."
He recommends that anyone getting into his business choose their partners carefully and hire an attorney to write a strong operating agreement among the partners. He did both.
"Picking the right business partner is as important as picking the right spouse," Becnel said.
I thought Sam Spade was single.

Obstacles in slayings case seen in account

BYLINE: Keith L. Alexander

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B04

LENGTH: 917 words

In the aftermath of a deadly shooting outside a party at a Southeast Washington apartment building, investigators searched for evidence that would positively identify one of their top suspects. But they never found it, and nobody came forward to name him.
As a result, authorities say, police couldn't obtain the arrest warrant they needed to get the suspect, Orlando Carter, off the street. Days later, according to prosecutors, Carter drove a rented minivan while three of his friends opened fire on another group. 
But Carter had been recognized at the party. Instead of telling authorities, Andre Morgan testified last week, he planned to avenge his dead friend - and is now charged with plotting to kill Carter.
Morgan's testimony highlights the sprawling, complex nature of the five-defendant trial, in which Carter, 22, and four other men face murder and other charges for their alleged roles in a series of March 2010 shootings that killed five. The trial is to start its third week Monday in D.C. Superior Court.
Jurors have heard from witnesses facing felony charges and others reluctant to speak. The trial could last months, and more than 100 could testify.
Morgan, 21, testified that he was outside the apartment after the party with his friend Jordan Howe, 20, on March 22, when he saw Carter arrive in a car and hand a gun to his brother Sanquan Carter, 21.
Angry after Sanquan's gold-colored bracelet disappeared, authorities say, the brothers and another man began shooting at the crowd. Howe was killed, and two others were hurt.
Morgan never planned to tell police, he testified. Instead,he told the jury, his first thought as he held Howe after the shooting was: "Kill Sanquan and Orlando."
People familiar with the case say Morgan and several friends then planned an attack on Orlando Carter the next day - an attack Orlando Carter survived.
Authorities said Orlando Carter then orchestrated further retribution: a March 30 drive-by shooting in the 4000 block of South Capitol Street SE that targeted mourners who had attended Howe's funeral. The drive-by, and the killing of a 17-year-old during a robbery minutes earlier, left another four dead and six injured.
Morgan's testimony was one of last week's key developments in the government's case against the five men charged in the shootings. It also illustrates a common frustration for District authorities who often struggle to find cooperative witnesses. Police say many are distrustful of them, while some witnesses say they fear for their safety.
"It's very frustrating," a homicide detective familiar with Orlando Carter's case said in an interview. "We like to close these cases as quickly as we can, but you have witnesses who refuse or have that 'I'm not a snitch' mentality."
In addition to the Carter brothers, also on trial are Jeffrey D. Best, 23; Robert Bost, 23; and Lamar Williams, 23. Each is charged with dozens of offenses, including first-degree murder, conspiracy and assault. All five pleaded not guilty.
After Howe was killed, Morgan testified, he and Howe's 21-year-old half-brother, Marquis Hicks, plotted along with several of their friends to kill Orlando Carter. On March 23, Morgan testified, Morgan and Hicks found him and shot him twice.
The identities of the men who attacked Orlando Carter were not known to police until after Morgan and Hicks were charged with an unrelated armed robbery in July 2010, according to people familiar with the case. They were subsequently linked to Carter's shooting and are charged with conspiracy to kill him, those people said.
Prosecutors have sealed the conspiracy cases against Morgan and Hicks.
Defense attorneys for the five defendants say Morgan falsely implicated the Carter brothers in an effort to curry favor with prosecutors in his own case. During his testimony, Morgan was repeatedly asked why he never told authorities that he recognized Orlando Carter at the party.
"I don't know," he replied.
Other witnesses have spoken of their reluctance to tell authorities what they saw on March 22, 2010.
"Where I'm from, you don't talk to the police," testified one 21-year-old woman who was a neighbor of Howe's and said she was outside during the party shooting. But she also eventually identified Sanquan Carter to investigators.
Some witnesses have said they fear retaliation against them or their families. A 17-year-old who was shot in his left leg at the party lifted his pants, showing his scars. Several jurors flinched.
In sometimes-heated exchanges with defense attorneys, he repeatedly explained that he refused to go to a hospital because he was "nervous" and "scared" to talk to police.
Authorities have offered to relocate witnesses and their families to undisclosed locations "until things blow over," the detective said, but some witnesses elected to remain silent.
Sitting in the courtroom, Nardyne Jefferies wondered whether the drive-by shootings, which killed her 16-year-old daughter, Brishell Jones, might not have happened if Morgan had stepped forward after the party.
"This could have been prevented if people stopped trying to take the law into their own hands and let people do their jobs," Jefferies said. "Instead of letting the police do their job, they just make the situation worse where innocent people end up getting killed."
The first person to name Orlando Carter as one of the shooters at the party was Nathaniel Simms, who pleaded guilty to a role in the party and drive-by shootings and has cooperated with authorities.

Kim visits DMZ, orders high alert
North Korean leader Kim Jong Eun visited the heavily armed border with rival South Korea and ordered troops to be on high alert, state media reported Sunday, just days after Washington and Pyongyang agreed to a nuclear deal after years of deadlock.
Kim's visit to Panmunjom village in the demilitarized zone, his first reported trip there since the December death of his father, Kim Jong Il, comes amid escalating militaristic rhetoric aimed at the South, a U.S. ally. 
Recent North Korean threats, including vows of a "sacred war" against Seoul over U.S.-South Korean military drills, appear to be targeted at a domestic audience, analysts say, and could be an effort to bolster Kim Jong Eun's credentials as a military leader after his foray into the diplomatic arena with the U.S. nuclear deal.
On Sunday, tens of thousands of North Koreans rallied in Pyongyang in support of toppling South Korean President Lee Myung-bak, who ended a no-strings-attached aid policy to the North when he took power in 2008, instead linking assistance to nuclear disarmament.

157 bodies foundin mass grave
Libyan government officials said Sunday that they have unearthed a mass grave with 157 bodies of rebel fighters and civilians in an eastern town that was a major battleground during the country's 2011 civil war.
It is the largest grave yet to be discovered from the conflict, which began as a popular uprising just over a year ago and ended with the capture and killing of Libyan leader Moammar Gaddafi in October.
The head of the government-run missing persons office, Omar al-Obeidi, said 80 of the bodies discovered in Bin Jawwad have been identified. All were from eastern Libya, he said, and the youngest was a 17-year-old male.
Obeidi said most appear to have died from gunshot wounds or rocket strikes. Some had been executed, while others had been severely disfigured by rocket attacks, he said.
Meanwhile, Libya's leadership has apologized after armed men smashed the graves of British and Italian soldiers killed during World War II, in an act of vandalism that bore the hallmarks of radical Islamists, the Reuters news agency reported.
Amateur video footage of the attack, posted on the social networking site Facebook, showed men casually kicking over headstones in a war cemetery and using sledge hammers to smash a metal and stone cross.
The attack happened in the eastern city of Benghazi, near where British and Commonwealth troops fought heavy battles against German and Italian forces during the 1939-45 war.

Chavez appears on TV from Havana
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez appeared on television for the first time in nine days, during which he underwent surgery in Cuba to remove a tumor.
In footage recorded Saturday in Havana and aired Sunday in Venezuela, Chavez spoke firmly and was accompanied by various government ministers and older brother Adan Chavez.
In a reference to the date of the taping, Chavez said, "Still it hasn't been six days, because the operation ended on the night of last Sunday." He displayed a Saturday copy of the Cuban government newspaper Granma and a similar copy of the Venezuelan government paper Correo del Orinoco.

206 killed in Congo Republic explosions: Blasts rocked the capital of the Congo Republic on Sunday after a weapons depot caught fire, officials said, killing at least 206 people and pinning many others beneath collapsed buildings, including a church. A morgue in Brazzaville took in 136 bodies Sunday afternoon, and more continued to arrive. A local hospital reported that at least 237 patients were wounded in the blasts.
Two Irish polls show support for E.U. fiscal treaty: A majority of Ireland's voters are prepared to support the European Union fiscal treaty in a referendum this year, according to two opinion polls published Sunday. The findings were the first since Ireland, which was granted an international bailout deal in 2010, announced last week that it would be the only member of the 17-nation euro zone to subject the treaty to a popular vote. A referendum date has not been announced, but a vote is widely expected to take place in late May or early June. The poll published in Ireland's Sunday Independent newspaper found that 37 percent of respondents intended to vote yes, 26 percent no, and the remainder were unsure. The survey in the rival Sunday Business Post found 44 percent in favor, 29 percent against and the remainder unsure.

A federal judge in Maryland has ruled that state residents no longer must show they have a good reason to carry a handgun outside their home, declaring a key provision of the state's gun-control laws unconstitutional.
Gun rights advocates said the opinion - in a relatively liberal state with some of the country's tightest gun restrictions - would help as they challenge similar laws in about a half-dozen states. Maryland officials said Monday that they are seeking a stay and will appeal the decision. 
U.S. District Judge Benson Everett Legg focused on one portion of Maryland law that requires residents to show they have a "good and substantial reason" to carry a gun, such as a "precaution against apprehended danger." Legg found that the requirement, kicking in alongside background checks, was too broad and said it violates the Second Amendment.
"The Court finds that the right to bear arms is not limited to the home," Legg wrote in a 23-page ruling signed Friday.
The judge added that the requirement for issuing a handgun permit amounts to a "rationing system" to limit the number of guns carried outside the home. "The law impermissibly infringes the right to keep and bear arms, guaranteed by the Second Amendment," he wrote.
The case centered on a Navy veteran, Raymond Woollard, who was denied a handgun permit in 2009.
In 2002, Woollard's son-in-law broke into Woollard's rural Baltimore County home, high on drugs and looking for car keys so he could drive to Baltimore and get more drugs, Legg wrote. Woollard pointed a shotgun at his son-in-law, who managed to wrestle it away before being subdued by Woollard's son, who also pointed a gun at the intruder.
Woollard applied for and was granted a permit to carry a handgun, according to the ruling. He was allowed to renew his permit in 2006, shortly after his son-in-law was released from prison, the judge wrote. But three years later, his renewal was denied, prompting him to appeal to the state's Handgun Permit Review Board.
The board ruled that Woollard had "not demonstrated a good and substantial reason to wear, carry or transport a handgun as a reasonable precaution against apprehended danger in the state of Maryland."
In the summer of 2010, Woollard sued.
Under state law, applicants for a carry permit must show, among other things, that they are not addicted to drugs or alcohol, don't have a history of violence and haven't been convicted of a crime and sentenced to more than a year behind bars. Those requirements still stand.
Legg's ruling only upended the "good and substantial reason" requirement. In his ruling, he said Maryland State Police have issued permits to people in professions that may carry a risk, such as armored-car drivers, security guards, police officers and prosecutors. Permits also go to those who can show they need "personal protection."
The judge wrote that the requirement doesn't ensure that guns are kept away from people "most likely to misuse them," criminals or the mentally ill, for instance. Nor, he wrote, does it ban guns in churches, government buildings or places where the "possibility of mayhem is most acute."
"It's definitely a great boost for the right to bear arms," said Alan Gura, a lawyer in the case who earlier helped overturn gun-control measures in the District. "People around the country are a little more secure in their freedoms today."
But others said that an important safeguard in Maryland - the ability to judge whether someone really needs to carry a gun in public - has been stripped away.
"This is a potentially very dangerous decision," said Jonathan Lowy, director of the Legal Action Project at the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which supported the state in the lawsuit. "People of Maryland have right to decide who can carry loaded guns in the public places that we all enjoy."
"I don't think this is a decision that will enhance public safety," said Daniel Webster, co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research. "It will more likely harm public safety."
The fight over gun rights in Maryland also reaches into the state legislature and produces a perennially heated debate in Annapolis, with Republicans blasting Democrats for imposing gun laws on the state's entire population that are tailored for the Baltimore and Washington areas.
Republican lawmakers have four bills pending in the House of Delegates to repeal the "good and substantial reason" requirement. Similar bills have failed repeatedly in recent years. There are now about 12,000 active handgun permits in Maryland, according to the state police.
Officials have denied an average of 214 applicants annually since 2009 on the basis of a finding that the person did not have a substantial reason to wear, carry or transport a gun, according to the state Department of Legislative Services.
During debate on the Republican-sponsored bills this year, state police warned that undoing the requirement would result in an initial wave of 15,000 applicants for handguns in the budget year beginning in July and that an additional 10,000 people would apply, on average, every year thereafter.
But the state's nonpartisan budget analyst's office took issue with those estimates. It said the state police had failed to provide a rationale for such a large projected increase. The analyst's office, nonetheless, estimated that the number of gun applications statewide would double, to about 3,600 annually.
During a Feb. 21 hearing in the House Judiciary Committee, dozens of gun rights advocates crowded the committee room to testify about the difficulty of obtaining a permit to carry a gun in Maryland.
Del. Michael D. Smigiel Sr. (R-Cecil), the lead sponsor of one of the bills, argued that the ability to carry a gun is an "unalienable right that comes from God" and grilled Maryland State Police Lt. Jerry Beason about the necessity of the "good and substantial reason" clause. Beason conceded that the phrase is "impossible" to define.
"Shame on the state of Maryland," Smigiel said.

'Star Wars' artist was force behind Darth Vader, R2-D2

BYLINE: T. Rees Shapiro

LENGTH: 838 words

Ralph McQuarrie, an artist whose paintings of a gold-plated robot in an otherworldly desert and an intergalactic sword duel between a scraggly youth and a black-masked villain helped persuade film executives to gamble on a young director named George Lucas and his visionary story, "Star Wars," died March 3 at his home in Berkeley, Calif. He was 82.
He had complications from Parkinson's disease, said John Scoleri, co-author of a book of Mr. McQuarrie's art. 
"Ralph McQuarrie was the first person I hired to help me envision 'Star Wars,'ג[#x20ac][#x160]" Lucas said in a statement posted online. "When words could not convey my ideas, I could always point to one of Ralph's fabulous illustrations and say, 'Do it like this.'ג[#x20ac][#x160]"
Mr. McQuarrie, for instance, designed the Samurai-inspired helmet and black caped-outfit worn by arch nemesis Darth Vader. (It was Mr. McQuarrie's idea to put a breathing apparatus on Vader's mask, so that he could survive in the vacuum of space, which led to the villain's raspy voice in the films.)
Mr. McQuarrie's pens, pencils and brushes brought lush color, dramatic scenery and lifelike characters to stunning vibrancy in film classics such as "Close Encounters of the Third Kind," "Cocoon," "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and "E.T."
He was part of a team that won the 1985 Academy Award for best visual effects for his work on "Cocoon," about aliens who can pass on the gift of immortality.
As an artist for all three episodes of the original "Star Wars" films, Mr. McQuarrie was widely credited with shaping Lucas's far, far away galaxy.
Mr. McQuarrie had been fascinated with flight and outer space exploration since his days building model airplanes as a youngster.
As a technical artist for Boeing in the 1960s, he drew diagrams for a manual on constructing the 747 jumbo jet and later worked as an illustrator animating sequences of the Apollo space missions for NASA and CBS News.
Through two artist friends, Mr. McQuarrie was introduced to Lucas in the mid 1970s.
At the time, Lucas' tale of a interplanetary civil war between a loose band of rebels and a Naziesque empire, had been rejected by United Artists and Universal.
Lucas enlisted Mr. McQuarrie's help to show movie executives his story. Using Lucas' script for inspiration, Mr. McQuarrie drew scenes of a space battle between laser-shooting fighter planes and lightsaber-wielding warriors.
Lucas, armed with the images, quickly won funding from 20th Century Fox and "Star Wars" was born, beginning with "Episode IV: A New Hope," in 1977.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5psCjg5-cIArtist Iain McCaig, who worked on the "Star Wars" prequels, Episodes I, II, and III, called Mr. McQuarrie a pioneer of film conceptual art. Before him, McCaig said, few directors called on artists to help visualize their projects.
"He didn't just draw a picture of Darth standing in a neutral pose," McCaig said in an interview, "he dida scene of Darth lashing out at Luke Skywalker. You could feel the power and the pathos going on in that moment. He did more than just design costumes. . . . He helped capture the the story-telling moments in really dazzling pictures."
Doug Chiang, who worked with McCaig as an artist on Episode I, said that Mr. McQuarrie's artwork was "cinematic."
"He painted and designed with a camera's point of view," Chiang said in an interview. "Most science fiction art at the time were for posters and book covers. But his looked like images you could see on the big screen."
He designed the porcelain armor of the Imperial storm troopers, the shiny gilt frame of the humanoid robot C-3PO and the droid R2-D2, which resembled a motorized trashcan.
Anthony Daniels, the British actor who portrayed C-3PO, initially turned down the part, unimpressed by his proposed character's lack of depth.
Then he saw an expressive drawing of the robot painted by Mr. McQuarrie.
"He had painted a face and a figure that had a very wistful, rather yearning, rather bereft quality, which I found very appealing," Mr. Daniels said in 2010. He took the job.
Ralph Angus McQuarrie was born June 13, 1929, in Gary, Ind., and grew up on a farm outside Billings, Mont.
He saw combat with the Army during the Korean War and survived a bullet to the head. The round punctured his helmet, bloodying his skull. After the war he attended what is now known as the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena.
He worked as an illustrator for a dental business drawing teeth and dentist's tools before his work in films. His art for "Star Wars" led director Steven Spielberg to tap Mr. McQuarrie to draw space ships for his movies "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" (1977) and "E.T." (1982). Survivors include his wife of 29 years, Joan, of Berkeley.
In "Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back" (1980), Mr. McQuarrie makes a cameo appearance in a scene inside a hanger on the icy planet Hoth.
On the 30th anniversary of "Star Wars," a collectible action figure was released of his character, rebel Gen. Pharl (a play on Ralph) McQuarrie, complete with blaster pistol.

Camerawork set the mood in 'Lenny,' 'Dirty Harry'

BYLINE: Dennis McLellan

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B07

LENGTH: 632 words

Early in his career as one of Hollywood's top cinematographers, Bruce Surtees became known for his artful use of low-level, moody lighting in films such as Don Siegel's "The Beguiled" and "Dirty Harry" and Bob Fosse's "Lenny."
Mr. Surtees, 74, who received an Oscar nomination for his work on "Lenny" and was closely associated with Clint Eastwood on many of his films, died Feb. 23 in Carmel, Calif., of complications of diabetes, said his wife, Carol. 
The son of three-time Oscar-winning cinematographer Robert Surtees, Mr. Surtees launched his career working for his father as a camera assistant on the 1965 western "The Hallelujah Trail."
Bruce Surtees had been the camera operator on two Siegel-directed Eastwood films made by Eastwood's production company - "Coogan's Bluff" (1968) and "Two Mules for Sister Sara" (1970) - when he made his debut as a director of photography on Siegel's 1971 Civil War drama "The Beguiled," also starring Eastwood.
Eastwood then chose Bruce Surtees to be the director of photography on "Play Misty for Me," his 1971 feature film debut as a director.
Mr. Surtees went on to be the director of photography on six more Eastwood-directed films over the next decade and a half: "High Plains Drifter," "The Outlaw Josey Wales," "Firefox," "Honkytonk Man," "Sudden Impact" and "Pale Rider."
"He was always looking to improve shots, and he could do a lot with little equipment in a very short time," Eastwood told the Los Angeles Times. "He was able to make things happen."
Eastwood recalled that while making "Coogan's Bluff" in New York, Mr. Surtees sat behind him with a hand-held camera as Eastwood raced a Triumph motorcycle through Fort Tryon Park.
 "So he was kind of fearless, or at least he put a lot of faith in the fact I could ride this damn thing," said Eastwood. "Then we'd turn around and have him ride backward on the motorcycle, and he'd be shooting the guy chasing me. He was just willing to try anything to get a shot."
 "Lenny," a 1974 movie about comedian Lenny Bruce shot in black and white and starring Dustin Hoffman, earned Mr. Surtees his nomination for best cinematography in 1975.
In his review of the film, Charles Champlin of the Times said that Fosse and Mr. Surtees "beautifully catch the flat neon world of all-night cafeterias, the smoky squalor of strip joints and coffee houses, the gray anonymity of hotel rooms and cheap apartments. As in 'Cabaret,' atmosphere becomes the shaping force on character that it is."
 "He was a rare Hollywood cinematographer who had no fear of exploring deep and profound blacks on screen," said Tom Stern, a cinematographer who works frequently with Eastwood and previously worked with Surtees as a lighting technician on many films.
 "He wasn't afraid of having the character exist in either silhouette or total darkness and letting the dialogue do the work," Stern said. "He enjoyed existing outside of the mainstream, but in my opinion he gave a lot of us fellow cinematographers permission to go into previously forbidden areas of darkness."
Mr. Surtees was director of photography on two other Siegel films starring Eastwood -  "Dirty Harry" (1971) and "Escape From Alcatraz" (1979) - and on Siegel's "The Shootist" (1976), starring John Wayne.
Among Mr. Surtees's other movie credits as director of photography are "Joe Kidd," "Blume in Love," "Night Moves," "Leadbelly," "Big Wednesday," "Risky Business," "Tightrope" and "Beverly Hills Cop." He also received an Emmy nomination in 1999 for  cinematography for the A&E biographical drama "Dash and Lilly," about the affair between writers Dashiell Hammett and Lillian Hellman.
Mr. Surtees, whose father won Oscars in the 1950s for "King Solomon's Mines," "The Bad and the Beautiful" and "Ben-Hur," was born Aug. 3, 1937, in Los Angeles.

Lawmakers quarrel over arrests at demonstration

DATELINE: RICHMOND

RICHMOND - Virginia Democrats and Republicans were on the offensive again Monday - but not over legislation. The barbs were related to the 30 protesters arrested Saturday ata reproductive rights rally outside the Capitol.
Democratic legislators criticized what they called excessive police force when officers wearing riot gear and carrying semiautomatic weapons arrested demonstrators who refused to leave the steps of the Capitol - where protests are prohibited.
"They were marching and chanting for women's rights," said Sen. Janet D. Howell (D-Fairfax). "And what did they face? SWAT teams, state police in full riot gear, police armed with semiautomatic guns and dogs - dogs. Not since the massive resistance days of the 1960s have I seen such a disgraceful display of excessive police presence." 
Hours later, Gov. Robert F. McDonnell and Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling, both Republicans, called on lawmakers to apologize for "unprecedented" remarks "attacking Virginia's law enforcement.''
"When you get to the point where your anger over losing an election and your anger over not getting the committee assignments you want spills over . . . to taking the floor to tear down our incredibly talented and brave law enforcement officers, it really has crossed the line,'' McDonnell said. "It really is over the top.''
The partisan bickering on Monday underscores the deteriorating relationship between Republicans and Democrats in the closing days of the 60-day legislative session. Republicans say the General Assembly has failed to pass a state budget because of the Democrats' bid for more power in an equally divided state Senate. Democrats blame Republicans for focusing on social issues, including abortion.
Officers arrested 30 of the estimated 1,000 protesters after they refused to leave and took them to the Richmond City Jail. Protesters say people were kept on a bus for hours before being processed, unable to receive drinking water and using a bucket for a bathroom.
The 17 women and 13 men were charged with either trespassing or unlawful assembly - both misdemeanors, Capitol Police Capt. Raymond Goodloe said. They were arraigned Monday and will appear in court later this month.
Goodloe denied that the police response was excessive but declined to say how many officers had been deployed. He acknowledged that some women had to wait to be processed for hours, as is sometimes the norm, but said there was a bathroom on the bus.
Organizers, who call themselves Speak Loud with Silence, had a permit to gather at the nearby Bell Tower. However, Goodloe said rallies are not allowed on the steps of the Capitol, where protesters had gathered.
Virginia has been in the spotlight in recent weeks for some of the abortion-related legislation considered by the General Assembly. Several bills have already died - including one that sought to define a fertilized egg as a person denying state-funded abortions to poor women with grossly deformed fetusesand another banning abortions after 20 weeks.
But at least one - requiring women to get an ultrasoundbefore an abortion - is on McDonnell's desk. He has until the end of the week to sign the legislation.
Two weeks ago, more than 1,200 peoplelined Capitol Square in silent protest against the abortion-related bills. Last week, 150 people gathered outside the governor's mansion.
Another demonstration is scheduled for Tuesday outside the venue where McDonnell is expected to vote in the GOP presidential primary.
House Minority Leader David Toscano (D-Charlottesville) wrote to Capitol Police Chief Steve Pike asking for a meeting to discuss protocol at protests.

Officer who killed soldier in 'friendly fire' incident remains in service 
The Army lieutenant who shot and killed Pfc. David H. Sharrett II of Oakton in 2008, and was promoted to captain the next year, remains a full-time soldier in the Army, Army officials confirmed Friday. 
Army commanders had said repeatedly that Capt. Timothy R. Hanson, 31, was "out of the Army." But after Secretary of the Army John McHugh told Sharrett's family on Thursday that Hanson was "still drawing a paycheck," a Pentagon spokesman on Friday reported that Hanson is an infantry captain in the Army Reserve, stationed at Fort McCoy, Wis. The spokesman, George B. Wright Jr., said Hanson is employed full time as a member of the 86th Training Division.
Hanson's military record, released by the Army on Friday after a month of requests, shows he was discharged from active duty in September 2010 at Fort McCoy. He has declined to comment on the case. As an executive officer and former platoon leader of the 101st Airborne Division, Hanson led an eight-man team into a firefight near Balad, Iraq, in January 2008, and forensics tests showed he shot and killed Sharrett in a "friendly fire" incident that Hanson has never fully explained. He did not tell anyone of the shooting and left the battlefield with four of his men unaccounted for. Hanson may have received a reprimand last year, after the Army's third investigation into the case, but the Army has declined to reveal if any action was taken.
Robert McCarthy, the lieutenant colonel who designed the operation and who declined to seek discipline for Hanson's actions, is being considered for promotion to colonel by the Senate, Sharrett's father was told. McCarthy did not respond to another request for comment. 
David Sharrett Sr. said Monday: "My family is disgusted that the Army embraced and rewarded cowardice in an attempt to protect the careers of Lt. Hanson's chain of command."

Medal of Honor recipient battled to fly flag at Va. home

BYLINE: T. Rees Shapiro

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B07

LENGTH: 769 words

Retired Army Col. Van T. Barfoot, who received the Medal of Honor during World War II and decades later drew national attention when he fought successfully against his homeowners association to keep a flagpole flying the Stars and Stripes in his front yard, died March 2 at a hospital in Richmond. He was 92.
He had complications from a fall, said his daughter Margaret Nicholls. 
Col. Barfoot grew up on a Mississippi cotton plantation before enlisting in the Army infantry in 1940. By the end of his career in 1974, he had served in three wars and received the military's highest award for valor - the Medal of Honor - for leading an assault on German troops during World War II.
In retirement, he lived a quiet life in rural central Virginia - tending to his vegetable garden, filling his bird feeders and catching catfish in his private pond - before moving to the Richmond suburbs in the summer of 2009.
Col. Barfoot erected a 21-foot flagpole in his front yard not long after taking up residence in the Sussex Square development in Henrico County.
Even as a nonagenarian, Col. Barfoot awoke every morning to hoist the American flag. At dusk, he lowered and folded the flag, hugging the triangular bundle to his chest as he walked back inside.
The community, governed by a homeowners association, had denied Col. Barfoot's initial request to put the flagpole in his yard, citing rules to maintain curb appeal.
The homeowners association sent him a letter ordering him to remove the flagpole and threatened to take Col. Barfoot to court to enforce the neighborhood's rules.
Col. Barfoot refused, and the resulting news brought support from Democrats and Republicans in the state and beyond.
From the White House, Obama administration spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters: "The president believes - I think all of us believe - that the very least we can do is show our gratitude and thanks to somebody that served our country so admirably."
Pressured by critics, the homeowners association relented in December 2009 and allowed Col. Barfoot to keep his flagpole.
Van Thurman Barfoot was born June 15, 1919, in Edinburg, Miss. He later changed his name to Van Thomas Barfoot.
In the Army, Col. Barfoot worked his way up the enlisted ranks before receiving a field commission during World War II.
Early in the war, he participated in the Army's invasion of Italy. As his unit moved inland, the soldiers took up defensive positions near Carano.
On May 23, 1944, Col. Barfoot was ordered to lead an assault on German positions. He went out alone and crawled to within feet of a German bunker.
According to his Medal of Honor citation, he tossed a grenade inside, killing two Germans and wounding three others. He then moved to another bunker nearby and killed two more German soldiers with his submachine gun while taking three others prisoner. A third machine gun crew, watching Col. Barfoot's methodical assault, surrendered to him. In all, 17 Germans gave themselves up to Col. Barfoot.
In retaliation, the Germans organized a counterattack on Col. Barfoot's position, sending three tanks toward him.
Col. Barfoot grabbed a bazooka grenade launcher and stood 75 yards in front of the leading tank. His first shot stopped it in its tracks. He then killed three of the German tank crew members who had attempted to escape.
The other two tanks, witnessing the destruction, abruptly changed directions, moving away from Col. Barfoot. Returning to his platoon, he helped carry two wounded U.S. soldiers almost a mile to safety.
Commending his "Herculean efforts," Col. Barfoot's citation praised his "magnificent valor and aggressive determination in the face of pointblank fire."
Col. Barfoot served in the Korean War and later in Vietnam as a helicopter pilot. His other military decorations included the Silver Star; two awards of the Legion of Merit; the Bronze Star; three awards of the Purple Heart; and 11 awards of the Air Medal.
His wife of 48 years, the former Norma Louise Davis, died in 1992. Survivors include four children, Margaret Nicholls of Richmond, Van T. Barfoot Jr. of Bremerton, Wash., James D. Barfoot of Lake Tapps, Wash., and C. Odell Barfoot of Huntsville, Tex.; a sister; 12 grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren.
In 2010, Virginia Gov. Robert F. McDonnell (R) signed legislation inspired by Col. Barfoot that prohibited homeowners associations from barring the proper display of the U.S. flag.
"All my life, from childhood to now, I have been able to fly the flag," Col. Barfoot said in 2009. "In the time I have left, I plan to continue to fly the American flag without interference."

Police slain in attack in western Iraq

DATELINE: BAGHDAD

BAGHDAD - A gang of gunmen disguised in military-style uniforms and carrying forged arrest warrants killed 25 police officers Monday, then hoisted the battle flag of al-Qaeda in a carefully planned early morning attack in western Iraq, officials said. 
The killings in Haditha highlight the success of al-Qaeda-linked militants in regaining a foothold in an area they once dominated through police executions and the killings of city officials.
By going after police, the militants demonstrate to the residents of Haditha, a desert city closer to the Syrian border than to Baghdad, how isolated they are from the central government's protection and intimidate those who want to join the security forces.
The city's proximity to the border, 65 miles away, means it is vital territory for the militants if they want to ramp up operations in Syria to help overthrow the government of President Bashar al-Assad. Already, Sunni fighters who revile Assad because he belongs to an offshoot religion of Shiism are crossing into Syria.
Iraqi officials described a systematic plot to kill police in Haditha, 125 miles northwest of Baghdad, with attackers disguising themselves in military garb and driving cars painted to look like Interior Ministry vehicles.
Mohammed Fathi, spokesman for the governor of Iraq's western Anbar province, where Haditha is located, said the gunmen claimed they were military officials with arrest warrants for city police officers. They were stopped at a checkpoint outside Haditha, where they took away the guards' mobile phones before shooting nine of them, he said.
The gang's convoy, described by one Haditha police lieutenant as 13 cars long, then stopped at the homes of two Haditha police commanders, including the colonel who served as the city's SWAT team leader. Brandishing the fake arrest warrants, the gunmen forced the commanders into the convoy and then shot both less than a quarter-mile away, he said.
Fathi said the gang had false arrest warrants for 15 police officials in Haditha. As the convoy moved through the city, the militants were stopped at another checkpoint near the main market. A fierce gun battle broke out, with the gang raising the black flag of al-Qaeda in a show of defiance. Six policemen were killed in that skirmish, and another six were killed in shootings as security forces chased the gang through the city, Fathi said. Two more policemen were killed at a checkpoint on Haditha's outskirts, he said.

Gunman soughtin campus library
Police searched for a possible gunman in the George Washington University library late Monday night after a gunman was reported to be headed toward campus from the White House area, a GWU spokeswoman said.
The search concluded about half an hour after the crowded library was evacuated around 11 p.m. No one was found.
An initial search of the area around the Foggy Bottom campus was touched off at about 9:30 p.m. by a report of a suspicious person possibly headed there, according to GWU spokeswoman Candace Smith. The report included a description and apparently indicated that the man was armed. 
An alert was issued to the GWU community, but an initial search turned up nothing, Smith said.
However, she said later, at about 11 p.m. a student reported seeing someone who resembled the description approaching or entering the library.

Two boys charged in 13-year-old's death
Baltimore police say two boys have been charged as juveniles with involuntary manslaughter in the shooting death of a 13-year-old girl.
The Baltimore Sun reported Monday that the unidentified 12-year-old and 13-year-old boys were charged in the death of Monae Turnage, 13, whose body was found Sunday night under plastic trash bags near her home.
Turnage was reported missing early Sunday by her family when she did not return after leaving home Saturday night to go skating with friends. Police said her brother found her  body.
An autopsy was planned Monday by the state medical examiner's office.

Silver Line riders may pay higher fares
The average fare on Metro's Silver Line could rise before the new rail extension even opens.
Officials had estimated that the average fare would be $3, but the proposal from Metro General Manager Richard Sarles would increase the average to $3.26. The increase would bring in an additional $1.1 million, according to the transit authority.
Metro released new numbers on the impact of the Silver Line before a Thursday board meeting. Some board members had asked for more details on expected revenue for the new line.
The first part of the 23-mile stretch of the Silver Line, expected to open late next year, is under construction. 
The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, which is overseeing the construction, plans to issue a request for bids in the coming months for a contractor to build the second phase. 
That construction could start in January.

Holder says U.S. has right to kill terrorist citizens abroad

BYLINE: Peter Finn;Sari Horwitz

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A03

LENGTH: 1165 words

The U.S. government has the right to order the killing of American citizens overseas if they are senior al-Qaeda leaders who pose an imminent terrorist threat and cannot reasonably be captured, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said Monday.
"Any decision to use lethal force against a United States citizen - even one intent on murdering Americans and who has become an operational leader of al-Qaeda in a foreign land - is among the gravest that government leaders can face," Holder said in a speech at Northwestern University's law school in Chicago. "The American people can be - and deserve to be - assured that actions taken in their defense are consistent with their values and their laws."
Holder's discussion of lethal force against U.S. citizens did not mention any individual by name, but his address was clearly animated by the targeting of Anwar al-Awlaki, a senior figure in al-Qaeda's Yemeni affiliate. Awlaki, who was born in New Mexico, was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Yemen in September.
Since that operation, the Obama administration has faced calls to explain the legal framework behind its decision to target Awlaki and to release at least portions of a classified memorandum by the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel that contains its evidence, reasoning and conclusions. 
Holder's speech represented the administration's most elaborate public explanation to date for targeted killings. And it followed a prolonged internal debate about how to inform the public about one of the most extraordinary decisions a government can take without explicitly acknowledging the ongoing classified drone program.
Among the most revealing parts of the speech was Holder's discussion of some of the factors the administration reviews before deciding that an individual represents an "imminent threat." He said the critical factors include the "relevant window of opportunity to act, the possible harm that missing the window would cause to civilians and the likelihood of heading off future disastrous attacks against the United States."
He said the president is not required by the Constitution to delay action until some "theoretical end stage of planning - when the precise time, place and manner of an attack become clear."
The attorney general's "flexible definition of 'imminent threat' is absolutely appropriate as applied to terrorist planners, but it may be unsettling to many in the international community who criticized President Bush for his principle of preemption," said John B. Bellinger, who served as a legal adviser to the State Department in the George W. Bush administration.
Bellinger said he agreed with the attorney general's statement of U.S. law for targeting an American, although he noted that the speech was less clear about how targeted killings comply with international legal rules. 
There are no known U.S. citizens on target lists maintained by the CIA or the military's Joint Special Operations Command.
Holder emphasized Monday that he would discuss the issue only in the abstract and would not "discuss or confirm any particular program or operation."
"In the deliberations over whether the attorney general should make a speech, the CIA was an early and vocal proponent of explaining publicly the legal framework for the use of force in U.S. counterterrorism operations," said a U.S. official familiar with the interagency deliberations and the drafting of the speech.
Critics of the administration said the government has assumed dangerous new powers. 
"While the speech is a gesture towards additional transparency, it is ultimately a defense of the government's chillingly broad claimed authority to conduct targeted killings of civilians, including American citizens, far from any battlefield without judicial review or public scrutiny," said Hina Shamsi, director of the ACLU's National Security Project. 
Holder argued that a careful and thorough executive branch review of the facts in a case amounts to "due process" and that the Constitution's Fifth Amendment protection against depriving a citizen of his or her life without due process of law does not mandate a "judicial process."
"Where national security operations are at stake, due process takes into account the realities of combat," Holder said. "Some have argued that the president is required to get permission from a federal court before taking action against a United States citizen who is a senior operational leader of al-Qaeda or associated forces. This is simply not accurate."
Holder said that the question of "whether the capture of a U.S.-citizen terrorist is feasible is a fact-specific, and potentially time-sensitive, question."
"Given the nature of how terrorists act and where they tend to hide," he continued, "it may not always be feasible to capture a United States-citizen terrorist who presents an imminent threat of violent attack. In that case, our government has the clear authority to defend the United States with lethal force."
Holder also noted that in using lethal force, the United States must make sure that it is acting within the laws of war by ensuring that any target is participating in hostilities and that collateral damage is not excessive. And he noted that law-of-war principles "do not forbid the use of stealth or technologically advanced weapons" - an apparent reference to drones. 
More broadly, Holder argued that the targeting of specific senior belligerents in wartime in not unusual, and noted the 1943 U.S. tracking and shooting down of the plane carrying Japanese Adm. Isoroku Yamamoto, the commander of the attack on Pearl Harbor. 
He said that "because the United States is in an armed conflict, we are authorized to take action against enemy belligerents under international law . . . and our legal authority is not limited to the battlefields of Afghanistan." 
Holder said he rejected any attempt to label such operations "assassinations."
"They are not, and the use of that loaded term is misplaced," he said. "Assassinations are unlawful killings. Here, for the reasons I have given, the U.S. government's use of lethal force in self-defense against a leader of al-Qaeda or an associated force who presents an imminent threat of violent attack would not be unlawful - and therefore would not violate the executive order banning assassination or criminal statutes."
Holder said "it is preferable to capture suspected terrorists where feasible - among other reasons, so that we can gather valuable intelligence from them - but we must also recognize that there are instances where our government has the clear authority - and, I would argue, the responsibility - to defend the United States through the appropriate and lawful use of lethal force."

Faces of the USS Monitor

BYLINE: Michael E. Ruane

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B08

LENGTH: 996 words

Perhaps they were friends - the older sailor who walked with a limp and always had a pipe clenched between his teeth, and the younger salt with the busted nose and the beat-up, mismatched shoes.
If not comrades in life, they became so in death, drowning together in the iron tomb of the USS Monitor as it capsized off Cape Hatteras, N.C., in 1862 and sank upside down in 40 fathoms of water.
More than a century later, their skeletons would be found, one atop the other - the younger man still with his shoes on - amid the guns, equipment and debris inside the famous warship's turret. 
And Tuesday, a few months shy of 150 years since their faces were last seen in the midst of the Civil War, likenesses of the Yankee seamenwere unveiled at the Navy Memorial in downtown Washington.
Eerie-looking clay heads, based on models of the men's skulls, sat on a table in an auditorium, beside photos that were enhanced to make their reconstructed faces more lifelike.
Experts said they hope the images might provide leads to the sailors' identities.
"Our greatest hope is that a descendant or two will come forward and maybe have . . .  an old family photograph," said Mary Manhein, director of the Louisiana State University forensics laboratory that did the reconstructions for free. "And then it would be confirmable through DNA."
The unveiling was the culmination of almost 40 years of research into the Monitor shipwreck by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Navy, the Mariners' Museum in Newport News, Va., and many other organizations.
"I think it's pretty amazing that we've finally gotten here," John D. Broadwater, a retired NOAA archaeologist who has been studying the Monitor for decades, said last week. "We can look into the eyes of those two men. It's . . . kind of moving."
Broadwater, who dived to the Monitor wreck and this month published a book about it, "USS Monitor: A Historic Ship Completes Its Final Voyage," was one of the first to begin excavating the human remains from inside the turret when it was raised from the bottom in 2002.
The Monitor is famous for battling the Confederate ship CSS Virginia, formerly the USS Merrimack, on March 9, 1862, in history's first fight between ironclad warships - 150 years ago Friday.
The battle, at Hampton Roads, was a draw, with each ship's cannonballs bouncing off the other's iron sides.
Later that year, the Virginia was blown up to keep it out of the hands of Union soldiers. Little of it has been found.
The Monitor sank in a gale about 1 a.m. Dec. 31, 1862. Most of the 63 crewmen escaped.
Sixteen men perished, but these two sets of remains are the only ones that have been recovered.
It's not known why the two stayed on the ship as the others abandoned it.
David W. Alberg, superintendent of NOAA's Monitor National Marine Sanctuary, said they might have had faith that their vessel would weather the storm, or they might have been afraid to leave.
Having stayed behind, their last moments were spent in a cold, pitching turret, illuminated by a single lantern, he said.
The identities of all those lost are known, and many crew members are depicted in old photographs - including a famous series taken on the ship by photographer James F. Gibson in July 1862.
On Tuesday, experts noted a resemblance between the reconstructed face of the older sailor and that of the Monitor's Welsh-born first-class fireman, Robert Williams, 30.
In two of Gibson's pictures, Williams appears in a cap and mustache, standing with his arms folded. He is surrounded by other members of the crew, who lounge on the deck, playing checkers and smoking pipes.
"We just did a match up of the photo of Robert Williams with the older sailor's facial reconstruction and it is very close," James P. Delgado, director of NOAA's Maritime Heritage Program,wrote in an e-mail Monday.
The wreck of the Monitor was located in 1973 by a Duke University research ship about 16 miles off the North Carolina coast in the stormy and treacherous region called "the graveyard of the Atlantic."
The two almost-complete skeletons were found in the turret when it was hauled out of the water, and scientists and researchers have been studying them for almost a decade.
A few facts were gleaned from the examination of the recovered remains: The younger man's broken nose and indications of a possible limp in the older man, a ring on one of his fingers and a groove in his front teeth where he bit down on his pipe.
In January, the forensics experts at LSU began applying clay to the skull models, using skin thickness formulas to re-create the likenesses.
The work was done at the university's Forensic Anthropology and Computer Enhancement Services, or FACES, laboratory, where scientists often use the process to help police identify unknown remains. 
Manhein said the lab has compiled data on facial skin thicknesses for people of different ages, sexes and populations.
Forensic sculptors first glue the proper thickness markers, which are actually pencil erasers of varying heights, to some 40 locations on the skull. Then they smooth on the clay at the prescribed thickness and fill out the face, lab research associate Nicole Harris said.
Prosthetic eyes are inserted - always brown, she said, because most people have brown eyes. Upon completion, photos are often taken and the images are further enhanced.
The models the scientists used are based on the actual skulls, which are housed with the skeletons at the military's Joint Prisoner of War Missing in Action Command in Hawaii, where much of the scientific work was done.
Tuesday, as a Navy honor guard in white leggings and white gloves paid tribute, Delgado said he thought the old Monitor sailors would be "bemused and somewhat amazed" by all the fuss.
"Two ordinary guys, caught up and made exceptional by circumstances beyond their control, have been brought back to the forefront," he said. "And in a way, through the work that's happened here . . . [they] live again."

Fatal stabbing makes a case for handguns

BYLINE: Courtland Milloy

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B04

LENGTH: 708 words

Robert Leroy Wright, 37, was walking his dog Sunday morning in Southeast Washington when police say he was confronted by a knife-wielding neighbor about "allowing the dog near his yard." A dispute ensued, and the neighbor, Ellsworth Colbert, 56, stabbed Wright to death, according to D.C. police.
Whether or not this story proves to be as insane as it sounds, the incident as reported does provide a textbook case for legalizing handguns in the District, as well as buttress a ruling Monday by a federal judge that declared significant parts of Maryland's gun-control law unconstitutional. 
To get a permit to carry a gun in Maryland, residents must prove that they have "good and substantial reason" to do so. Hogwash, says the judge. He might have noted that someone like Wright would never have been able to prove that he needed a gun to walk his dog - until Sunday, that is. By then, of course, it would have been too late.
To better understand the benefits of a "concealed carry" firearm, consider how the encounter between Wright and Colbert might have unfolded if Wright had been armed and followed a basic self-defense protocol:
According to police reports, Colbert comes out of his house with a knife in one hand and a stick in the other. Being alert to the approaching threat, an armed Wright would now have several options. He could pull his gun, say, a .40-caliber Glock semiautomatic, which speaks volumes without firing a shot: "Never bring a knife to a gunfight, pal."
Or he could just wait until the assailant gets close enough to meet the legal definition of justifiable homicide.
In January, two men were pumping gas at a Sunoco station in Prince George's County when a would-be robber approached with a knife and a can of Mace. Well, wouldn't you know that the two men turned out to be off-duty D.C. police officers. And out came the Glocks.
Never bring a knife to a gunfight, pal.
On the other hand, never underestimate the knife.
In some places, such as the District, the knife now surpasses the gun as the weapon most commonly used in reported assaults. In the past six months, from September to Feb. 26, there were 397 reported assaults with knives, compared with 278 with guns. This year, there have been more than 110 reported knife assaults and 73 with guns.
There's a service station at the corner of Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and Sheriff Road, at the District and Prince George's line, that sells assault knives for about $10. The most popular is a spring-loaded Army-style tactical knife with a nasty, three-inch serrated blade curved like a raptor's claw.
In a kind of "West Side Story"-style gang fight, a large group of youngsters from two rival neighborhoods met up last month for a showdown in Southwest Washington. When D.C. police arrived on the scene, the brawlers ran off - leaving behind a girl bleeding on the sidewalk.
The fight had apparently been arranged on Facebook, according to police. And the knives used were comparably high-tech. But the business end is still just a blade - as convenient in a kitchen as it is deadly in the streets.
Even nice, quiet streets in middle-class neighborhoods like Penn Branch.
Why Wright allowed Colbert to walk right up to him, allegedly with a knife, we may never know. Rule No. 1: If you see someone coming at you with a knife, run the other way. Forget macho. Scream, too.
Wright broke off the encounter and headed home with his dog. But Colbert followed, police said.
Now, if an armed Wright had not already shot Colbert, that would have been the time to do it. A man with a knife following you home? To your wife and children?
Instead, Colbert caught up to him, police said, and a "verbal altercation" ensued - then turned violent. The knife slashed at Wright, cutting his arm then opening up what witnesses described as a "large bleeding gash" on his neck. Apparently in shock, Wright went home and returned to confront Colbert with a shovel.
"You going to stab me?" Wright asked, according to police.
He was stabbed multiple times and died an hour later.
Say what you will about the perils of gun ownership, but nobody can doubt that Wright would be alive today if he'd had one.

Official is charged with reckless driving

BYLINE: Matt Zapotosky

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B03

LENGTH: 566 words

Prince George's County police on Tuesday reversed a controversial decision and charged council member Karen R. Toles with reckless driving for allegedly traveling on the Capital Beltway at more than 100 mph.
Police said they think they can prove that Toles showed a "wanton disregard for safety" when an officer spotted her speeding.
The new charge - which carries a $510 fine and six-point license penalty - is significantly more serious than what the council member had faced initially. Her driving privileges could also be suspended. In the past two years, Toles (D-Suitland) has been convicted of driving off the roadway while passing a vehicle and unsafe lane change - violations which carry penalties of one point each. A reckless driving conviction would push Toles's total above eight points and initiate the process to suspend her license, according to authorities and court records.  
"I take no pleasure in this additional action but know it is the right thing to do for our county," Prince George's Police Chief Mark Magaw said at a news conference Tuesday. 
The reckless driving charge stems from a Feb. 22 incident in which a Prince George's police officer saw Toles's county-issued Ford Edge traveling southbound on the Capital Beltway, law enforcement officials have said. The sport-utility vehicle veered across several lanes of traffic as it drove toward the exit for Branch Avenue, the sources said.
The officer turned on his lights and sirens and followed Toles, law enforcement sources have said. As he did, his cruiser camera showed him going as fast as 108 mph, the officials have said. 
The officer gave Toles a ticket for making an unsafe lane change and a warning for speeding, the officials have said. The unsafe lane-change ticket carries a $90 fine and a one-point license penalty.
The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because commanders are reviewing the incident.
Last week, police defended the officer's actions, saying that he had no radar gun to determine Toles's exact speed and that the equipment in his cruiser was not properly calibrated because he normally works in an administrative job. They said that while the officer had to speed to catch Toles, he did not have enough time or space to determine her pace. 
Magaw repeated those defenses Tuesday and said that issuing the unsafe lane-change ticket was "adequate." But he said a review panel of police commanders, the department's inspector general and Prince George's State's Attorney Angela Alsobrooks determined that the reckless driving citation was warranted "given the totality of the circumstances" - even if the exact speed could not be proved. 
"The review panel had hindsight," Magaw said. "They had all the information. They had to go through everything."
Magaw said that he was present when officials gave Toles, who has been active in pushing public safety legislation, the new ticket in her attorney's office and that "she was fine." Toles's voice mail was full, and she did not return an e-mail message seeking comment. Rosalyn E. Pugh, her attorney, issued a written statement Tuesday declining to comment on the new charge. 
Toles has previously said in statements that she was late for an appointment the day she was pulled over and that she intended to pay the fine. She said she would not drive a county-owned vehicle until she completed a driver improvement course.

Bill extends youth mental health services

BYLINE: Tim Craig

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B04

LENGTH: 781 words

The D.C. Council agreed Tuesday to increase behavioral health services and testing for city youths to try to keep students in schools and out of jail, but officials caution that the District still has to find money to pay for some key provisions of the bill.
After two years of work, the council tentatively approved a broad series of reforms in response to a March 30, 2010, shooting rampage that killed four youths and injured six in Southeast Washington. 
Five men are on trial in the shooting, which District officials said exposed major gaps in efforts to preemptively address mentally unstable or violent youths.
The bill, a top priority for council member David A. Catania (I-At Large), calls for an extension of mental health services to all public and charter school students, including those in pre-kindergarten and Head Start.
The District also will implement new truancy rules, mandatory behavioral health screenings for youths in the juvenile justice system and a citywide study to evaluate the mental health needs of District youths.
By the 2016-17 school year, the bill mandates that all students have access to mental health professionals in school. Currently, one in three District schools offers in-school behavioral evaluation and care.
The council unanimously approved the changes Tuesday, but it must vote on the legislation a second time later this month. Mayor Vincent C. Gray (D) is expected to sign it.
"This will represent the most comprehensive behavioral infrastructure in the country," Catania said. "It represents two years of thoughtful engagement of the stakeholders to try to come up with something that will materially advance the well-being of our young people."
One of the city's worst mass shootings in decades came in March 2010 after teenagers gathered at a house party after a funeral in Southeast Washington. Some walked a few blocks away to South Capitol Street SE, and gunmen, allegedly armed with assault-style weapons and semiautomatic pistols, opened fire.
Police said the shooting capped a spiral of violence set off days earlier by the disappearance of a gold-colored bracelet.
The shooting shocked city leaders, some of whom questioned whether it could have been prevented if school and law enforcement officials had been moreadept at spotting potential mental health problems.
Nardyne Jefferies, whose daughter, Brishell Jones, was killed in the shooting, helped the council draft Catania's bill.
But some provisions of the bill may be implemented only if city finances improve.
In a statement to the council, Chief Financial Officer Natwar M. Gandhi warned that there is not enough money in the city's spending plan through fiscal 2015 to fund the bill.
Gandhi estimated that the bill will cost taxpayers almost $23 million over the next three years, which will require Gray and the council to prioritize the initiative when they make spending decisions later this year.
The biggest cost - about $20 million over three years - will be for the expansion of mental health and truancy services to all schools, Gandhi said.
Gandhi said he is concerned that many charter schools do not have enough resources to pay for the changes.
But Catania and several council members argued that the city will have to find the money to pay for the changes, noting that some of the costs stem from the school system's failure to fulfill existing legal requirements.
Among other changes, the bill requires an "analysis of the root cause" of bad or truant behavior and mandates that the school system connect the student with needed services.
"Parents are screaming out for resources to help their children, and they don't exist," Catania said. "This is going to be an expensive proposition, but we ignored it long enough."
Last year, 20 percent of D.C. public school students had at least 15 unexcused absences, council officials said. Under current rules, students are permitted up to 25 days of unexcused absences before they are referred to truancy court. The bill reduces that number to 20.
Lee F. Satterfield, chief judge of the D.C. Superior Court, worries that the change could result in too many students clogging the federally funded D.C. court system.
"We would have to add several staff members in order to meet the expected increase in the volume of referrals," Satterfield wrote. "We propose delaying the effective date . . . pending the Congress appropriating sufficient funds to the Superior Court."
Council member Marion Barry (D-Ward 8) countered that lawmakers have to act to prevent another "atrocious, terroristic act."
"Someone who takes a gun on a whole group of people must have psychological problems that must be addressed," Barry said.

10 suspects heldin Haditha killings 
Iraqi security forces on Tuesday arrested 10 suspects in a shooting rampage that left 25 police officers dead the day before in Anbar province, the Iraqi government said.
The suspects confessed to methodically targeting police commanders and security checkpoints Monday in Haditha, a city 125 miles northwest of Baghdad, an Interior Ministry statement said.
Four other suspects were killed, including two suicide bombers who blew themselves up when Iraqi soldiers stormed their hideout, the statement said. 
The Monday attack replicated tactics used by Sunni insurgents during sectarian violence several years ago and appeared aimed at reasserting the grip of al-Qaeda-linked militants in the wake of U.S. troops' pullout late last year.

Guerrilla groupfrees 11 oil workers
Colombia's ELN guerrillas have freed 11 oil workers who were kidnapped late last month, the International Committee of the Red Cross said Tuesday, adding that the release "was carried out at the direct request of the armed group and upon request of the families."
Although a decade-long U.S.-backed crackdown on Colombia's Marxist guerrillas cleared the way for record oil exploration and production, security problems such as hostage-taking and pipeline bombings remain a major concern for oil and gas companies.
The contractors were snatched in Arauca province as they traveled by bus to the Bicentennial pipeline, which carries crude from Colombia's central plains to its Caribbean ports.

Report cites gains in potable-water access
The world's nations achieved a U.N. goal of halving the proportion of people without access to safe drinking water five years ahead of the 2015 target, the United Nations announced Tuesday.
A report issued by the U.N. children's agency and the World Health Organization said 6.1 billion people, or 89 percent of the world's population, had gained ready access to drinkable water at the end of 2010.
But UNICEF and the WHO said that 783 million people - 11 percent of the global population - still have no such access.

O'Malley plans commutations

Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley(D) on Wednesday will take a key legal step toward commuting the prison terms of inmates serving life sentences for murder - a first for the governor, who won the state's top office on a reputation as a tough-on-crime, big-city mayor.
O'Malley will file notice that he is considering freeing a Prince George's County woman who was convicted 27 years ago of setting up a man for a robbery in which he ended up being shot and killed by the woman's boyfriend.
O'Malley is also poised to commute the sentence of a Baltimore man whose conviction for a shooting in the mid-1980s has gained national attention since the only independent witness in the case recanted his testimony. 
Commutations are risky decisions for governors, and they have gained heightened scrutiny since 2009, when an ex-convict killed four police officers nine years after Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee(R) commuted his sentence. This year, on his final day in office, Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour (R)pardoned nearly 200 people, setting off a political and legal firestorm.
Aides to O'Malley said that after denying 57 requests to commute sentences in the past six years, the cases that he will make public on Wednesday could meet an end for different reasons.
In the Prince George's case, a wide discrepancy exists in punishments for the woman and her co-defendant. She has been incarcerated far longer than the co-defendant, who pulled the trigger. In the Baltimore case, no clear answers exist about culpability. Aides said another important consideration for O'Malley has been that both inmates have given every indication that they could return to society successfully.
Rick Abbruzzese, O'Malley's director of public affairs, said that reaching this final, public stage of the process was "significant" for the governor, who now wants to make sure that anyone who might object has a chance to be heard. Most notably, aides said, they are hoping the public notice reaches relatives of the Prince George's victim, whom members of O'Malley's administration have not been able to find.
If no objections are raised, probably in a matter of weeks, O'Malley's decision will send the cases back to the state's parole commission, which has already issued recommendations for release, although the proposed timings of those releases have been shared only with the governor's office.
If O'Malley does decide to free one or both, it would mark a major break with one of the clearest policies that he and other recent Democratic governors in the state have maintained.
O'Malley, former governor Parris N. Glendening and other recent Democrats have maintained near bans on commuting sentences of inmates convicted of murder. Former governor Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. (R) had commuted and pardoned hundreds during his term, although only a small fraction of them had been convicted of murder. 
O'Malley has also been stingy with pardons of former convicts who have gone on to live cleanly for many years after prison. 
In the Prince George's case, aides said the evidence that O'Malley seems to have found most convincing was a profound discrepancy between the prison term served by the man who pulled trigger and the woman who initiated the crime.
In November 1984, Tamara Settles, then 26, met a Southeast Washington man in the Silver Star Night Club on E Street NW.
Settles "struck up a friendship" with Charles Fowler, then 53 and a D.C. resident. She later left the bar with him, according to the original police report.
Settles lured Fowler to a street in Hyattsville where her boyfriend was waiting. That  man, Herman Ray Rockingham III, "opened the driver's door and with gun in hand fired two shots at the victim and at the same time demanded the victim's wallet," the police report said.
One of the shots struck Fowler in the head, and he died five days later in Prince George's Hospital.
Rockingham, the shooter, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 15 years to life. He later was able to get that reduced and was released after about nine years. 
Settles chose to go to trial and was convicted of felony murder and sentenced to life without parole.
Now 53, Settles has served three times the number of years as Rockingham. From behind bars, she has completed 12 years of drug addiction therapy, earned an associate's degree, worked as a volunteer mentor and is taking classes toward a bachelor's degree from Morgan State University.
To get this close to release, nonetheless, has been no easy decision for O'Malley, said Kristen Mahoney, the governor's top adviser on crime, who recounted a painstakingly detailed review of the cases undertaken by O'Malley in a conference room in the State House.
"I can't underscore how serious he takes this responsibility, especially given his role in Baltimore," Mahoney said Tuesday. "He has seen these victims, and while he doesn't know these particular shooters, he knows these shooters' stories."
O'Malley's announcement, which to comply with state law will be filed Wednesday in a legal newspaper, comes just weeks before a new deadline for him to decide any parole requests that have been lingering for 180 days.
Republicans and Democrats in the state legislature have in recent years criticized O'Malley for not acting in a timely fashion on parole decisions. Last spring, the General Assembly passed a billrequiring the parole board's recommendations for those who have served at least 25 years to take effect after 180 days if O'Malley has not disapproved of them in writing.
O'Malley's aides said most of the requests that the governor gets from the state's parole commission are for commutations, not parole. The governor and his staff have quietly investigated and issued denials since he took office in 2007. O'Malley was not required to issue decisions on commutations by the coming deadline, but aides said he wanted to comply with the spirit of the law passed by the legislature.
 Unlike in Baltimore, where as mayor he would show up at crime scenes, O'Malley has drawn little attention for his crime-fighting efforts since becoming governor.
He pushed the state to clear its backlog of untested DNA samples early in his first term, and promoted tougher sex-offender legislation after the killing of an Eastern Shore girl. But he has often used executive powers to quietly change the way the state targets its most violent offenders for incarceration
The second inmate who could be freed is Mark Farley Grant. He was 14 when he allegedly shot another teenager and stole his coat in a Baltimore street robbery in 1983.
The case has been major cause of the Innocence Project, a student-faculty law clinic at the University of Maryland. Since the clinic took on Grant's case, a friend of the victim recanted his account of the altercation and fingered Grant's co-defendant in the case as the shooter.
