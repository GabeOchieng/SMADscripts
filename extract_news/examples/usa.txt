New York City police were working Monday to determine whether a series of suspected arson attacks against an Islamic cultural center and three other locations in Queens were linked -- and whether they were hate crimes.
No one was injured in the four attacks Sunday, though some of the damage may be extensive. Structural damage to the Imam Al-Khoei Foundation was minimal, but some members of the center were emotionally shaken, assistant Imam Maan Al-Sahlani said. "This has never happened here before," he said. A home sometimes used for Hindu services, another home and a bodega also were targeted. Gov. Andrew Cuomo condemned the attacks as being "against everything we stand for as New Yorkers and Americans."
Authorities: Killer's body found in snow 
A plane searching the slopes of Mount Rainier National Park for an Iraq War veteran suspected in the slaying of a park ranger found his body lying face down in chest-deep snow Monday, authorities said.
Pierce County sheriff's spokesman Ed Troyer said Benjamin Barnes, 24, was believed to have fled to the park after an earlier shooting at a New Year's house party near Seattle that wounded four, two critically. Barnes was accused of shooting ranger Margaret Anderson later Sunday.
Protesters tag along at Roses parade
The 2012 Tournament of Roses brought its parade of floats and strutting bands to a worldwide audience, followed by a scruffier parade of hundreds of anti-Wall Street protesters.
The 123rd annual New Year's event, with the theme "Just Imagine," flowed along downtown Pasadena to the cheers of hundreds of thousands, with an estimated 40 million people watching on U.S. television. The band music was followed by chants of "Banks got bailed out, we got sold out" as the Occupy the Rose Parade demonstrators retraced 1.5 miles of the 5.5-mile parade route before veering off for a rally near City Hall. "Everything went very, very well. We're very pleased," police Lt. Phlunt Riddle said.
Florida A&M approves anti-hazing plan
Trustees at Florida A&M University voted to create an independent committee to study hazing as well as a campus memorial and scholarship honoring drum major Robert Champion. The five-member committee will study hazing at other universities, methods that have helped students resist hazing and how to best govern FAMU's famed Marching 100 band. Champion's death in November and the severe beating of another band member have brought renewed scrutiny to a hazing culture in the band.
Christopher Chestnut, lawyer for the Champion family, said "memorials, scholarships and committees will not bring Robert Champion back." He said the family hopes FAMU will focus on "substantive strategies" to end hazing. "That is the legacy Robert would have wanted," he said.
Rescued kids released from Utah hospital
Three Utah children were released from a Salt Lake City hospital two days after being rescued from a car that skidded into a river and flipped.
Primary Children's Medical Center spokeswoman Bonnie Midget said the children had recovered from hypothermia and went home with their father. Roger Andersen, 46, lost control of the car Saturday on a narrow stretch of road in Logan Canyon. As many as 10 people jumped into the icy, waist-deep Logan River to help save the kids after the car plunged down a 10-foot embankment, state Highway Patrol Lt. Steve Winward said. The rescuers helped turn the Honda Accord upright, and a retired police officer shot out the car's window with a handgun.

Syrian tanks pull back, but killings go on

BYLINE: The Associated Press

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 5A

LENGTH: 443 words

Syria's government has withdrawn heavy weapons from inside cities and freed about 3,500 prisoners, but security forces continue to kill protesters even with foreign monitors in the country, the Arab League chief said Monday. 
Nabil Elaraby said pro-regime snipers continue to operate, and he demanded a full cease-fire.
Arab League monitors are supposed to verify Syria's compliance with a league plan to stop the 9-month-old crackdown on dissent. President Bashar Assad agreed to the plan on Dec. 19, but since league monitors began work Dec. 27, activist groups have claimed that government forces have killed more than 150 people, the vast majority of them unarmed, peaceful protesters.
"Yes, there is still shooting and yes there are still snipers," Elaraby told a news conference in Cairo, the Arab League's base. "Yes, killings continue. The objective is for us to wake up in the morning and hear that no one is killed.
"There must be a complete cease-fire," he said.
Elaraby said Syrian tanks and artillery have been pulled out from cities and residential areas, food supplies have reached residents, and bodies of dead protesters have been recovered.
Rami Abdul-Rahman, who heads the British-based activist group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, confirmed that tanks had withdrawn from Syrian cities last Thursday but said residents reported that the weapons were still a threat.
"They can bring the tanks back and use them to fight," Abdul-Rahman told the Associated Press.
The Arab League plan requires Assad's regime to remove security forces and heavy weapons from city streets, start talks with opposition leaders, free political prisoners and allow human rights workers and journalists into the country.
Elaraby called on the opposition and ordinary Syrians to aid the observers by sending them names of relatives or friends they think are detained by Assad's regime.  "We call for the release of all of them," he said.
Elaraby defended the Arab League mission and Lt. Gen. Mohamed Ahmed Mustafa al-Dabi, the Sudanese general heading it. He called al-Dabi "a capable military man with a clean reputation."
Controversy has swirled around al-Dabi because he served in key security positions under Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, who is wanted on an international arrest warrant for crimes against humanity in Darfur.
Amnesty International said al-Dabi led al-Bashir's military intelligence service until 1995, when he became head of external security. "During the early 1990s, Sudan's military intelligence was responsible for the arbitrary detention, disappearance and torture or other ill-treatment of numerous people in Sudan," it said in a statement.

Man to face charges of arson in N.Y. attacks

BYLINE: John Bacon with staff and wire reports

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 602 words

A man who confessed to a string of New Year's Day arson attacks at an Islamic cultural center and four other New York-area sites where he had personal grievances was arrested Tuesday on a hate crime charge, police said.
Ray Lengend, 40,  who lives in Queens, was tracked through  a stolen car with Virginia license plates that was believed to be at the scene of at least two of the attacks Sunday evening on a convenience store, three  homes and the cultural center, police spokesman Paul Browne said. 
Browne said Lengend made statements implicating himself in the attacks and had personal problems with each location. Charges against Lengend include one count of arson as a hate crime, four counts of arson and five counts of criminal possession of a weapon.
$322M asbestos judgment tossed out
A judge has thrown out a $322 million lawsuit verdict hailed as the largest asbestos award for a single plaintiff in U.S. history. The Mississippi case turned after defense lawyers requested that Smith County Judge Eddie Bowen be removed from the case, saying he had failed to disclose that his parents were involved in asbestos litigation.
The plaintiff, Thomas Brown, claimed he inhaled asbestos dust  manufactured by Chevron Phillips Chemical and Union Carbide. The state Supreme Court granted Union Carbide's request to remove Bowen. The new judge, William Coleman, vacated the $322 million verdict.
TSA had stopped soldier once before
The Army Special Forces demolition expert who was detained New Year's Eve at a Texas airport when explosives were allegedly found in his carry-on bag was stopped the week before at a North Carolina airport carrying a smoke grenade in his luggage, federal court documents say.
When the grenade was confiscated in Fayetteville, N.C., Trey Atwater was "admonished" by Transportation Security Administration officials and allowed to board his flight to Midland, Texas. The powerful C-4 explosives were allegedly discovered Saturday by TSA screeners at Midland International Airport as Atwater attempted to leave Midland.--Kevin Johnson
Abortion clinic fire draws scrutiny
Investigators enlisted a chemical-sniffing dog from the Florida fire marshal's office to help determine whether a New Year's blaze that gutted a Pensacola abortion clinic was arson.
The clinic has been a target for violence and protests since the early 1980s. It was bombed on Christmas Day in 1984; in 1994, a physician and a volunteer were shot to death. No one was hurt in Sunday's fire. The Florida fire marshal's office is heading the investigation, and the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives have joined the effort, fire marshal's office spokeswoman Deborah Cox said.
Kentucky begins releasing convicts
Nearly 1,000 Kentucky convicts are prepared to walk out of prison early as part of changes approved by lawmakers last year. New rules allowed prisoners within six months of their release date to begin leaving Tuesday under the supervision of probation and parole. They will be given counseling and help with finding jobs and housing. The move is designed to save $40 million annually  and keep inmates from returning.
Bloomberg not gaga over Gaga kiss
New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said the New Year's kiss he shared with Lady Gaga was nothing compared with the one he got later from his longtime girlfriend.
Bloomberg, 69, and Gaga locked lips after leading a Times Square crowd in a final-minute countdown to midnight. When asked about the kiss Tuesday, Bloomberg said he'd "be remiss" if he didn't say "the best kiss of the night came after that," from girlfriend Diana Taylor.

Body found on grounds of queen's estate

BYLINE: The Associated Press

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 4A

LENGTH: 353 words

A murder mystery is unfolding at the vast country estate where Queen Elizabeth II and family celebrated Christmas and New Year's.
British police said that a young woman's body was found in the forest at Sandringham near two horse-breeding farms in an area of the 31-square-mile estate that is open to the public. 
The royal family is not implicated in the death, and the case is being treated as a homicide, police said. The cause of death was not disclosed, and police had yet to determine the woman's identity.
The body was discovered New Year's Day by a dog walker 3 miles from the queen's elegant country home. Norfolk police said tests showed the body had been there one to four months.
The queen and her husband, Prince Philip, spent the holidays at Sandringham with their children and grandchildren. The royal couple were there on Tuesday, along with their youngest son, Prince Edward, and his wife, Sophie.
The body was found at Anmer, a hamlet of several dozen people 115 miles northeast of London. Sandringham has two stud farms for race horses and a fruit farm and employs more than 100 people full time.
Forensics investigators in white gear were seen walking through the woods Tuesday in an area cordoned off by police.
"We are at the very early stages of the investigation, and it could be a complex inquiry," Detective Chief Inspector Jes Fry said.
Fry said authorities were examining missing-person reports and unsolved cases around the country to see whether there were any possible links.
The royal family owns vast tracts of land throughout Britain, and it is not unprecedented for serious crimes to be committed on property under their control.
In 2010, the body of a woman was found on the crown estate near Windsor Castle. She had apparently been killed by hammer blows to her head. Her estranged husband was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 26 years in prison.
Sandringham has served as a private residence for British monarchs since 1862 and has long been one of the queen's favorite residences. The royal family usually enjoys hikes, horseback riding and shooting parties  in the  winter weather.

'Glock': A handgun's heated history; 
Colorful account puts firearm in cultural context

Glock: The Rise of America's Gun
By Paul M. Barrett
Crown, 291 pp., $26
*** 1/2 out of four
Any shooter, determined to kill, can do so with any number of weapons -- a Sig Sauer, a Smith & Wesson or an AK-47. 
That a Glock was used in the Tucson killing spree that seriously wounded U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords adds one more page to the dramatic and controversial  history of the top-selling handgun in America.
Glock: The Rise of America's Gun by Paul M. Barrett, an editor at Bloomberg Businessweek, is a succinct and fascinating study of a weapon created by an Austrian businessman who, before he sold guns, made curtain rods and door hinges.
The story of Gaston Glock's rise to the top of the gun manufacturing hierarchy began in 1982 when he created the pistol that would become the weapon of choice for the Austrian Army.
But timing is everything.
The Glock came along just as law enforcement agencies around the world were looking to adopt handguns with more firepower. The weapon fit the bill with its large-capacity spring-action magazine, its quick reload, its reliability and its accuracy.
As more U.S. police departments switched to the Glock in the 1990s, the gun-buying public followed suit.
It soon became the favorite weapon  for cops, criminals and the  public.
And like countless other consumer fads, Barrett writes, the Glock, with its black matte finish and boxy shape, found its way into the popular culture.
In 1971, Clint Eastwood's "Dirty Harry" praised Smith & Wesson's .44 Magnum as "the most powerful handgun in the world," but in the '90s, the Glock had its "Dirty Harry moment."
Its firepower was lauded by Bruce Willis in 1990's Die Hard 2, and in 1998's U.S. Marshals, Tommy Lee Jones told Robert Downey Jr. to get rid of his Taurus PT945 and "get yourself a Glock and lose that nickel-plated sissy pistol."
Soon, Barrett writes, rappers embraced the Glock in lyrics and videos.
Authors such as Elmore Leonard dropped Glocks into their novels. Prime-time TV cops began carrying them.
But Barrett's Glock goes beyond pop culture and history. (Iraq's Saddam Hussein was carrying one when he was pulled out of his hidey-hole in 2003.)
It's also the story of the pro- and anti-gun movements in America and the oh-so-colorful biography of Gaston Glock, his business savvy, his notorious strip-club antics, the con men who stole from him, and an attack on his life in which Glock overpowered an  assassin.
Barrett also lays out how the business missteps of Smith & Wesson, Colt, Beretta and other gunmakers helped Glock roll over all of them.
As one gun blogger told Barrett: "It's a Glock world when it comes to handguns in America."

McCain pads front-runner's comfort zone; 
But candidate admits his Iowa win by a whisker bodes tough battle

BYLINE: Jackie Kucinich, USA TODAY

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 6A

LENGTH: 453 words

Mitt Romney swept into New Hampshire on Wednesday relieved after his razor-thin win in Tuesday's Iowa caucuses and quickly grabbed the endorsement of the man whose win here four years ago was the beginning of the end of Romney's bid for the 2008 Republican nomination. 
"New Hampshire," said Sen. John McCain of Arizona, "is the state that will catapult him to victory in a very short amount of time." McCain won the New Hampshire primary both times he sought the White House -- in 2000 and 2008 -- and his second win overcame Romney's appeal in New Hampshire as a former governor of neighboring Massachusetts.
This year, however, Romney is the clear leader in New Hampshire. The latest poll by Suffolk University, released Tuesday, gave him a 29-point lead over his nearest challenger, Rep. Ron Paul of Texas.
Romney has polled around 40% in New Hampshire polls since the fall. Former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum, who finished in a dead heat with Romney in Iowa, received only 6% in the poll.
Still, Romney barely won the Iowa caucuses against a field that lacked the money to truly attack him. He won the same percentage of voters in Iowa as he did in 2008, barely beat a candidate who spent most of the campaign driving around Iowa in a friend's pickup truck. He acknowledged the slim margin on the flight to New Hampshire on Wednesday morning, saying he liked landslide victories, but "I just didn't see that in last night's figures."
He now faces competitors who are running out of time to make a move or who are angry, such as former House speaker Newt Gingrich. On Wednesday, Gingrich bought a full-page advertisement in the New Hampshire Union Leader, the state's largest newspaper, whose conservative editorial page has endorsed Gingrich. The ad called Gingrich a "bold Reagan conservative" and Romney a "timid Massachusetts moderate."
Gingrich finished fourth in Iowa after leading in the polls as late as mid-December. He called Romney a liar for saying he had no role in the negative ads released by a pro-Romney political action committee that weakened Gingrich's support.
An onslaught of attacks on Romney, assuming anyone has the money to launch them, is unlikely to affect Romney's lead in New Hampshire, said Fred Malek, a longtime Republican fundraiser and activist.
"He is so well liked in New Hampshire," Malek said. "Negative ads work on a candidate who is not well-defined."
Gingrich won't be able to carry off the attacks, said Ken Dufour of Nashua, N.H., who said he considered voting for Gingrich before deciding on Romney.
"He's coming here guns blazing, but he has no money, no bullets in his cannon," said Dufour, who watched Romney at a town hall meeting in Peterborough on Wednesday afternoon.

Forced treatment doesn't work; 
OPPOSING VIEW

BYLINE: Joseph A. Rogers

SECTION: EDIT; Pg. 8A

LENGTH: 382 words

Whenever there is violence involving someone with an apparent mental illness, there is a stepped-up demand for forced treatment of those, such as myself, who have a psychiatric diagnosis. However, leaving aside the violation of people's rights, I can tell you from my personal experience with both forced and voluntary treatment that coercive "treatment" doesn't work. Force only drives people away from treatment. 
Legislation mandating force is based on the false premise that people don't want help. Instead, people often cannot secure services despite repeated attempts because our mental health system is "in shambles," according to the President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health.
Studies have shown that what works is not force but access to effective services. We don't need to change the laws to make it easier to lock people up; existing laws provide for that when warranted. Instead, we need to create and fund effective community-based mental health services  that would make it attractive for people to come in and receive care, and that would support them in their recovery.
We also must end the discrimination that discourages people from seeking help. "Discrimination has no place in our society." So said Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., who in 2008 praised the passage of  legislation designed to end insurance discrimination against  people seeking mental health treatment.
Anyway, we can't predict the exceedingly rare violent acts by those  with psychiatric conditions. In fact, studies show that such individuals  are far likelier  to be  victims of violence than  perpetrators.
We do need stronger gun control laws. It's significant that, in one year, guns killed 17 people in Finland, 35 in Australia, 39 in England and Wales,  194 in Germany, 200 in Canada, and 9,484 in the U.S.
And we should support the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which does groundbreaking work to improve mental health services and to promote hope and recovery for individuals with even the most severe mental health conditions.
Joseph A. Rogers is executive director of the National Mental Health Consumers' Self-Help Clearinghouse, a national technical assistance center funded by a grant from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.

Parents question use of deadly force against son; 
Shooting of Texas teen stirs debate on look of pellet guns

BYLINE: The Associated Press

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 5A

LENGTH: 519 words

On a doorstep outside a family home, a father wondered why police had to shoot his son in the hall of the boy's middle school. In an office across town, a police chief insisted his officers had no choice. 
And scores of others in this Texas border city wondered: Could the death of 15-year-old Jaime Gonzalez have been prevented?
A day after police fatally shot an eighth-grader who was brandishing a realistic-looking pellet gun, his anguished parents wanted to know why police didn't try a Taser or beanbag gun before resorting to deadly force.
"Why three shots? Why one in the back of the head?" asked the boy's father, Jaime Gonzalez Sr. Some standoffs  last three or four hours, he said. This one "took not even half an hour."
Brownsville interim Police Chief Orlando Rodriguez said the preliminary autopsy report showed the boy was not shot in the back of the head.
There was broad agreement among law enforcement experts: If a suspect raises a weapon and refuses to put it down, officers are justified in taking his life. The shooting also raised questions about whether pellet guns should be marked to easily distinguish them from real handguns.
Rodriguez defended his officers, saying the younger Gonzalez pointed the pellet gun at police and repeatedly defied their commands. He said the boy was shot twice in the torso and had a head "laceration as a result of the fall."
Authorities also released a 911 recording from Cummings Middle School. The assistant principal on the phone first says there's a student in the hall with a gun, then reports that he is drawing the weapon and finally that he is running down the hall.  Police can be  heard yelling: "Put the gun down! Put it on the floor!"  Someone else yells, "He's saying that he is willing to die."
When officers got to the school, the boy was waiting for them, Rodriguez said. Moments before he was killed, Gonzalez  began to run down a hallway, but again faced officers. Police fired down the hallway -- a distance that made a stun gun or other methods impractical, Rodriguez said.
Under federal law, pellet or BB guns must be sold with an orange band around the tip of the barrel so they can be distinguished from real weapons. Gonzalez's gun had no markings, according to Rodriguez.
Cary Young  at Sam Houston State University's Law Enforcement Management Institute said pellet guns are often painted black so the orange tip no longer shows. An officer dealing with someone holding such a gun has  to consider it a deadly weapon, he said.
Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck said the  shooting appears to be another in a series of incidents that might have been prevented if pellet and BB guns looked different from other weapons.
The older Gonzalez said his son was not a bad kid, an assessment supported by the district superintendent. The teen was a drum major whose band instructors had recently praised his achievements to his parents, said his stepmother, Noralva Gonzalez.
She showed off a photo on her phone of a beaming Jaime in his drum major uniform.  Then she flipped through three close-up photos she took of bullet wounds in her son's body.

Breakdown in reporting lets mentally ill buy guns; 
OUR VIEW

SECTION: EDIT; Pg. 8A

LENGTH: 585 words

A year after the shooting of Arizona Rep.  Gabrielle Giffords and several others outside a Tucson supermarket, there's little sign of change  that might help  prevent a new tragedy.
Leave aside for a moment the bitter debates over gun-control, and focus first  on two issues Americans  tend to agree on: Severely disturbed and potentially violent people  such as Arizona's Jared Loughner should  receive  treatment for mental illness. And they certainly shouldn't be able to buy guns.
Long before the Tucson shooting, Loughner's behavior terrified people around him, so much that one of the teachers at the community college he attended asked that a guard be posted outside the classroom whenever Loughner was there, and one of his fellow students always sat near the door so she could leave if Loughner became violent. 
In most cases, even mental illness this severe is treatable. Sadly, though, none of those people or dozens more who came in contact with him thought to notify authorities, and like about half of people with severe mental illness, Loughner  didn't believe he was sick. In most states, almost anyone -- a teacher, a parent, even a friend or a neighbor -- can petition mental health authorities or a court to have someone like Loughner evaluated for mental illness. About half of states allow involuntary, court-ordered treatment for people judged to be dangerous to themselves or others, a threshold Loughner might not have met since he apparently made no overt threats. Other states, including Arizona, wisely allow courts more latitude in requiring  treatment for those who clearly need it.
Bizarrely, though, even if Loughner had been  ordered into treatment, there's a good chance he would have had no problem passing a background check to buy a gun. That's because only a handful of states bother to pass along all the records of those formally judged to be mentally ill to the federal background check database that gun dealers must consult.
The consequences are tragically measurable.  Seung Hui Cho, who slaughtered 32 people at Virginia Tech University in 2007, was free to buy the pistols that  he used even though a judge had found him to be mentally ill. Virginia never reported that fact, and he had no trouble passing gun-store background checks.
Virginia has since become one of the most diligent states in reporting those with mental illness, but it's an exception. An exhaustive report in November by the group Mayors Against Illegal Guns found that  most states appear to under-report, and some hardly bother to comply at all.
The federal government can't legally compel states to submit those records, and states have all sorts of excuses for failing to comply, typically that they lack laws to permit or require reporting mental health records, or that they don't have the resources, even though Congress passed a law to give states grants to help cover the cost.
To be sure, mental health issues are sensitive and complex, as is involuntary treatment. Most people with problems pose no threat to others. But to ignore those who are as transparently menacing as Cho and Loughner is outrageous. It means that throughout much of the nation, they would have no trouble breezing through a background check and buying a gun because in most states treating or reporting them is not a priority.
It shouldn't  take another massacre for states to learn the bitter lesson Virginia did -- or for people to take responsibility for trying to get severely disturbed individuals the help they need.

'Tragedy beyond words' recalled; 
Anniversary of shooting that killed six and injured 13, including a member of Congress, reopens wounds in Arizona

BYLINE: Dennis Wagner, USA TODAY

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 725 words

One year ago this Sunday, a lone assassin walked up to Rep. Gabrielle Giffords outside a suburban supermarket and shot her in the head, then continued blasting away at others who were waiting to see the congresswoman.
It's an anniversary that no one in Arizona wants to celebrate but all will remember.
As smoke cleared and sirens wailed, a federal judge, a 9-year-old girl and four others lay dead or dying.  Giffords, D-Ariz., was wounded along with 12 other victims. And 22-year-old suspect Jared  Loughner, subsequently diagnosed as psychotic, was pinned to the ground by bystanders. 
The morning massacre ended in a matter of seconds, but Pima County, Ariz.,  Supervisor Ann Day  said repercussions linger for a community, a state and a nation.
"It was just a tragedy beyond words," she added. "The impact will forever be with us."
Day, a friend of Giffords', spoke Wednesday just after completing a dedication hike on the Gabe Zimmerman Memorial Trail, named for a congressional aide killed in the attack on Jan. 8, 2011.
This week, dozens of Arizona memorial events are planned, including candlelight ceremonies, religious services, concerts and a symposium on political decency.
Giffords is scheduled to attend a Sunday vigil at the University of Arizona  emceed by her district director, Ron Barber, who also was wounded in the attack. Pia Carusone, Giffords' chief of staff, said the congresswoman "felt it was important to be in her hometown with her family, staff members and a few close friends."
Giffords, 41, is just one of many victims struggling to overcome emotional trauma and physical wounds -- in her case, brain damage. A nation watched as the congresswoman battled to survive,  walk and regain  a halting ability to speak. In May, she was able to watch her astronaut husband, Mark Kelly, successfully complete the U.S.'  final space shuttle mission. The couple  describe their ordeal in the book Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope.
Giffords, who has yet to announce whether she'll seek re-election this year, continues to undergo therapy.
Along with stories of courage, there was pain and loss. U.S. District Judge John Roll was among those killed. So was third-grader Christina-Taylor Green, whose father called her "Princess."
Even those who disarmed the suspect tell of suffering from depression, nightmares and frustration. "It's not been going well," said Roger Salzgeber, 63, a retired nursery wholesaler who evaded bullets with his wife, Faith, before jumping on top of Loughner. "I can't get past the image of me and Faith on the ground surrounded by a sea of blood. And I'm angry at the fact that six people who are dead don't get the recognition they should."
The shooting became an immediate lightning rod for debate about social civility.  Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik blamed hate-filled politics for the mayhem.
Those statements only prompted more rancor  from critics such as Amy Kremer, chairwoman of the Tea Party Express,  who  told NPR the killings had nothing to do with politics, but were the act of a lunatic.
The massacre also renewed debate over gun control.
Several of those involved have joined Mayors Against Illegal Guns to lobby Congress for  legislation. Retired Army colonel Bill Badger, 75, who was grazed in the head before he helped take down the suspect, told a Senate Judiciary subcommittee, "It's not a political issue. It's about saving lives."
The National Rifle Association and other  Second Amendment defenders have said  that a gun-carrying  civilian might have stopped the spree.
Since Loughner's federal indictment on 49 counts, the justice system  has wrestled with how to deal with a defendant who was ruled incompetent to stand trial and has resisted treatment. It is unclear if or when he may face a jury.
In a new book, A Safeway in Arizona: What the Gabrielle Giffords Shooting Tells Us about the Grand Canyon State and Life in America, author Tom Zoellner contends that the killing spree was a product of  spiteful politics, a broken mental health system, wide-open gun laws and suburban alienation.
"A number of malevolent factors came together. ... I think it's flat out wrong to say that Jared Loughner came from nowhere," said Zoellner,  who worked on Giffords' 2010 campaign.

Rep. Giffords leads Pledge at Tucson vigil

BYLINE: Richard Ruelas

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 351 words

Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, using her left hand to lift her right hand to her heart, led a crowd  in the Pledge of Allegiance Sunday at a candlelight vigil  marking the  deadly rampage one year ago that shook a community and shocked a nation. 
Her words were clear and cheered by the crowd of about 3,500 people at the University of Arizona.
The evening vigil capped a day of events to remember the shooting at Giffords's meet-and-greet at a grocery store outside Tucson that left six people dead, including 9-year-old Christina-Taylor Green and a federal judge. Thirteen others were wounded, including the Democratic congresswoman.
It has been a year of reflecting on lives shattered, of struggling with flashbacks and nightmares, of replaying the what-ifs before the gunman's attack.
Gifford's husband, Mark Kelly, told the crowd that Tucson would not be defined by the shooting, but by the community's strength in the days and months afterward.
As the vigil concluded, the crowd chanted, "Gabby, Gabby, Gabby."
Many throughout this  community began the day  by ringing bells at 10:11 a.m., the exact time the gunman shot Giffords in the head and  moved down a line of people waiting to talk to her.
At a Tucson cathedral, girls in white dresses and red sashes danced down the  aisle as a song called Hero in the Dark played, and a pastor called on everyone to celebrate the lives of those  lost and those who acted heroically during the shooting.
The names of all  six  killed were read as a bell rang for each of them, and their family members and survivors placed red roses in a vase at the front of the church. "We remember, we remember, we remember with grateful hearts," the group chanted.
Roger Salzgeber wrestled the gunman that day, and he came to the Safeway  early Sunday where the shooting occurred.  He sat at the picnic table near where it happened, sipping coffee, dressed for a motorcycle ride, shrugging his shoulders.
"Tomorrow, I'm leaving this all behind me," he said. "I've spent the year looking in the rearview mirror, and I'm not looking in that mirror anymore."

TSA finds more guns at airports; 
Average of four a day was seen last year

BYLINE: Bart Jansen, USA TODAY

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 1A

LENGTH: 266 words

More people are being caught at the nation's airports with guns in their carry-on bags, despite heightened awareness about security. 
The Transportation Security Administration says it found 1,238 firearms -- an average of almost four a day -- at its airport checkpoints last year. The number has been on the rise since 2007.
"Clearly, just the fact that we are getting four to five guns every day indicates that there are people who are not focused on the security protocols," TSA Administrator John Pistole told Congress in November, a month when officers found nine guns in a single day.
The TSA says guns usually are found in carry-on bags that are X-rayed at security checkpoints.
Pistole says full-body scanning machines also detect contraband hidden beneath passengers' clothing, including a .38-caliber handgun in one man's ankle holster in Detroit.
"More than 10 years after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks people are still trying to bring deadly weapons into the cabin of an airplane," he says.
Passengers are required to declare their guns and then store them unloaded in hard containers in their checked bags.
The common reply from passengers when caught with a gun is that they forgot they were carrying one, the TSA says. That's what the 73-year-old man with the ankle holster said Dec. 10, Detroit airport spokesman Michael Conway says.
Same goes for a Georgia man, who was charged Dec. 11 with carrying a weapon at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport after officers found a loaded revolver in his messenger bag. The .22-caliber gun went off as police officers tried to unload it.

Haditha killings trial starts for last Marine

BYLINE: John Bacon with staff and wire reports

LENGTH: 584 words

A Marine staff sergeant charged in the biggest criminal case against U.S. troops in the Iraq War lost control when he and his squad killed 24 Iraqis, including unarmed women and children, a prosecutor told a jury at Camp Pendleton, Calif.
Staff Sgt. Frank Wuterich went on trial Monday, more than six years after the killings that the prosecutor, Maj. Nicholas Gannon, said took place in Haditha while the squad was going door-to-door clearing homes. Defense lawyer Haytham Faraj told the jury of Marines that Navy investigators, under pressure to show the Corps was not covering up the massacre, brutally interrogated the other Marines and offered to drop charges if they testified against their leader. 
Wuterich is charged with voluntary manslaughter in nine deaths. He has said he  believed he was following  regulations. He is the last of eight Marines to face charges; six had charges dropped or dismissed, and one was acquitted.
Florida man accused of plotting attacks
A Florida man was charged with plotting a series of attacks, including use of an explosive-laden vehicle to bomb a Tampa-area nightclub.
Sami Osmakac, a naturalized citizen from the former Yugoslavia, was arrested after an undercover FBI agent delivered guns, a car bomb and a suicide belt rigged with explosives -- all of which had been rendered inoperable prior to the transaction, federal documents say. Osmakac, 25, was ordered held without bond on a charge of attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction.
"I want to do something, something terrifying," Osmakac told the undercover FBI agent during a New Year's Day meeting at a Tampa-area hotel, according to the documents.-- Kevin Johnson
USDA cutbacks to reach 46 states
The U.S. Department of Agriculture will close 259 domestic offices, labs and other facilities as part of an effort to save $150 million per year, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said.
The closures and other cost-cutting steps will affect the USDA headquarters in Washington and operations in 46 states. The closures follow a review of USDA operations, and its $145 billion budget, as part of the Obama administration's effort to cut waste, Vilsack said.
NASA promises compromise on artifacts
NASA chief Charles Bolden met with Apollo 13 commander James Lovell and other former astronauts and said the agency is committed to working out ownership issues for artifacts that flew aboard Apollo moon shots and other missions.
NASA has questioned whether Lovell has the right to sell a checklist from the mission that received a bid of more than $388,000 at auction. The agency also sued former astronaut Edgar Mitch over an attempt to sell a camera from the Apollo 14 moon mission. Bolden called Lovell and the others heroes and promised to resolve disputes about items from missions dating to the original Mercury manned space program.
Pardons draw controversy in Mississippi
Outgoing Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour is taking heat after pardoning at least four convicted killers who worked as inmate trusties at the Governor's Mansion. The pardons outraged some victims' relatives and Democratic lawmakers.
Mark McAbee called Barbour's pardon of Joseph Ozment, the man who killed his uncle, a "slap in the face." Public Service Commissioner Brandon Presley, a Democrat, posted on Facebook that "Serving your sentence at the Governor's Mansion where you pour liquor, cook and clean should not earn a pardon for murder."
Barbour, a Republican, has said in the past that pardoning mansion workers is a state tradition.

Cop deaths trigger a training review; 
Some eye raids as too risky a tactic

BYLINE: Kevin Johnson, USA TODAY

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 441 words

The recent surge in fatal police shootings is weighing heavily on law enforcement trainers, some of whom are calling for a reassessment of high-risk fugitive and drug raids that have resulted in a number of deadly ambushes. 
"It's time to change our thinking," says Pat McCarthy, who advises police agencies across the country. "Cops are exposing themselves to increasing danger many times over, and it's just not necessary."
Harvey Hedden, executive director of the International Law Enforcement Trainers and Educators Association, said the group is urging its 4,000 members to "look at everything" in an effort to avoid potentially dangerous complacency on the streets.
"Police work can be 99% boredom and 1% panic," Hedden said. "Routine can be the most dangerous of all. We need to go back to the basics."
Federal and local officials have been troubled for the past two years by the number of firearms-related fatalities. Gun-related fatalities last year were up  15% from 2010. So far in  2012, four officers have been killed by gunfire -- one more than at the same time in 2011.
Last week, in the most violent episode of the new year, one Utah officer was killed and five others were wounded when they attempted to serve a drug-related search warrant in Ogden.
The officers, members of a narcotics strike force,  were met at the door by a former  soldier, who allegedly opened fire on the squad, killing 30-year-old Ogden officer Jared Francom. The suspect, Matthew Stewart, 37,  was wounded in the confrontation. His injuries are not considered life-threatening.
Weber County Sheriff Terry Thompson said that the incident and the officers' actions remained under investigation and that  the activities of the strike force are "on hold" because about half of the unit was involved in the shooting.
McCarthy said the deadly confrontation underscores a need for police to rethink their tactics.
"The days of knocking down doors in drug cases should be over. Given what's going on now, you have to consider other options," McCarthy said.
He said law enforcement officials should focus more on attempting to lure suspects out into the open or simply "wait them out."
Of the 68 firearm-related fatalities last year, a Justice Department review found that at least 10 officers died while serving search warrants or participating in multiagency raids.
Later this month, the Justice Department is hosting a meeting of researchers and law enforcement officials to discuss tactics and training in the wake of the officer deaths. "You can have all of the equipment in the world, but if somebody wants to kill you, they will if you give them the opportunity," he said.

Mental illness alone not enough to force treatment

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 8A

LENGTH: 498 words

Opposing view writer Joseph Rogers' statement that violence by people with mental illness leads to "a stepped-up demand for forced treatment of those, such as myself, who have a  psychiatric diagnosis" is  misleading for two reasons ("Forced treatment doesn't work,"  One year after Tucson shooting debate, Friday): 
The involuntary treatment laws for which there has been stepped-up demand  specifically exclude "forced treatment."
Not a single involuntary treatment law in the country lets people be involuntarily treated because they have a mental illness.  Numerous other criteria have to be met (for example,  dangerous behavior, threats, suicidal thoughts or lack of capacity).
To imply  these laws are aimed at people just because they have a psychiatric diagnosis ("such as myself")  gives the wrong impression.  The laws work and deserve everyone's support.
DJ Jaffe, executive director
Mental Illness Policy Org
New York
Some are unaware of condition
Joseph  Rogers, executive director of the National Mental Health Consumers' Self-Help Clearinghouse,  misses the basic point about many people who have severe mental illness, such as Jared Loughner.
Rogers says  "we need to create and fund effective community-based mental health services that would make it attractive for people to come in and receive care, and would support them in their recovery." Without a doubt, that is an excellent goal. But even if it  were achieved,  no such service -- no matter how "attractive" -- would have propelled someone such as Loughner to voluntarily  seek care and sustain receiving such care.
Rogers overlooks the fact that people with severe mental illness, as a symptom,  often do not have the insight to be aware that they have such an illness, or that it's severe.
That is  when a law allowing professionals, family members and friends, and in certain cases the legal system, to seek treatment for someone so impaired that he or she does not know that help is needed makes sense. It would save both money and lives.
Mental illness is treatable. If those who cannot, because of the very nature of their illness, seek help on their own, we as a society should assist them in doing so.
Nancy L. Wolf
Chevy Chase, Md.
Focus on major cause of violence
Joseph Rogers states that violent acts by people with psychiatric conditions are "exceedingly rare."  He then advocates for more gun control as a partial solution, noting the much higher rates of gun-related killings in the U.S. compared  with several other countries. I disagree strongly with this position.
Since we both agree that mentally impaired individuals are not involved in most killings, then just who is responsible for most of them?
I contend that much of the  gun-related violence  in this country involves illegal drugs.  Furthermore,  the government's drug war  is the cause of  a great deal of this misery. One need look no further  than the violence of the  Prohibition era. End the drug war and end the violence!

Syria's Assad vows to use 'iron hand' against opponents; 
'We will not be lenient,' he says

BYLINE: The Associated Press

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 6A

LENGTH: 439 words

Syrian President Bashar Assad vowed Tuesday to respond to threats against him with an "iron hand" and refused to step down, insisting he still has his people's support despite a 10-month-old revolt. 
Assad repeated claims that a foreign conspiracy -- not true reform seekers -- is behind the unrest, and he blamed the news media for fabrications.
"Our priority now is to regain security in which we basked for decades, and this can only be achieved by hitting the terrorists with an iron hand," Assad said in a nearly two-hour speech to a cheering crowd packed with well-dressed supporters at Damascus University. "We will not be lenient with those who work with outsiders against the country."
Assad has refused to give in to the most serious threat that his family's 40-year dynasty has faced. He lashed out at the Arab League, saying the Cairo-based bloc failed to protect Arab interests. The league has suspended Syria and sent a team of monitors to assess whether the regime is abiding by an Arab-brokered peace plan that Assad agreed to on Dec. 19. "The Arab League failed for six decades to protect Arab interests," Assad said. "We shouldn't be surprised it's failed today."
Kuwait's official news agency, KUNA, reported that a group of Arab League observers was attacked by "unknown protesters" in the northern city of Latakia on Monday and that two Kuwaiti army officers were lightly injured.
Also Tuesday, activists said Syrian security forces shot dead at least 10 people in the eastern city of Deir el-Zour despite the presence of an Arab observer mission in the area.
Assad has made only four public speeches since the anti-government uprising began in March, inspired by revolutions in other Arab countries. His military forces have been accused of killing thousands of Syrians who demonstrated peacefully against the regime.
Rime Allaf, an associate fellow at London's Chatham House think tank, said the speech was "a pretense of strength" while distributing blame for Syria's problems on everyone else. "His excessive discussion of details on so-called reforms, followed by details on the so-called conspiracy, is a desperate attempt to convince Syrians that the regime will survive what it describes as a crisis," she said.
Regime opponents denounced the speech.
"The speech didn't bring anything new that could end the crisis and its repercussions," said Hassan Abdul-Azim, an  opposition figure in Syria.
"Assad talked once again about foreign conspiracy and claimed the Arab League is a cover for a foreign intervention without pointing out that the Arab League wants, through its plan, to protect the Syrian people," he said.

God'sgift Achiuwa led the Red Storm (8-8, 2-3) with 20 points and seven rebounds.
Women's games
No. 1 Baylor 71, Oklahoma State 44: The Lady Bears used a 20-4 burst early in the second half to pull away from a two-point halftime edge for their 33rd consecutive home victory. Brittney Griner led Baylor (16-0, 3-0 Big 12) with 28 points and 11 rebounds, her 34th double-double. Liz Donohoe led Oklahoma State (9-3, 1-2) with 19 points and eight rebounds.

German police raid homes of 44 suspected neo-Nazis

BYLINE: From staff and wire reports

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 4A

LENGTH: 423 words

German police raided 44 homes Thursday linked to suspected neo-Nazis believed to have taken part in an illegal torchlight parade in eastern Germany.
Saxony police spokesman Lorenz Haase said 190 police officers were involved in the raids in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and Brandenburg looking for evidence against 41 neo-Nazis. They are believed to have participated in a September march in the town of Stolpen, east of Dresden, wearing black clothing with black hoods, white masks and carrying torches. 
Police say such marches are used to spread their far-right ideology. Police aren't saying what led them to the particular suspects, who are being investigated for breaking public assembly laws, nor whether any evidence was found in the raids. There were no arrests.
Germany has mobilized to go after the far-right National Democratic Party following the revelation that neo-Nazis are believed by police to have been responsible for the murder of at least nine immigrants and one policewoman since 2000. Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich has said he is investigating ways to ban the party.
Police had ruled out racism as a motive for the shooting of eight Turkish shop owners and one Greek man in cities across Germany between 2000 and 2006. But police now say the killings were carried out by a trio of neo-Nazis, prompting an investigation into whether police failed to solve the crimes to prevent national embarrassment over the perpetrators.
Two of the alleged killers died after a botched bank robbery Nov. 4, when Uwe Mundlos, 38, shot Uwe Bhnhardt, 34, and killed himself, says the Federal Criminal Police Office. In their apartment police found the murder weapons and a DVD claiming responsibility for all the killings. The third alleged member, Beate Zschpe, is awaiting trial.
The two men and possibly others, such as Zschpe, committed their first murder in 2000, shooting flower vendor Enver Simsek eight times in Nuremberg, the Federal Prosecutors Office says. Eight more would die over the next six years, but it wasn't until the fifth killing that police determined the deaths were connected.
The gun used to kill Yunus Turgut in 2004 as he opened his kebab shop in Rostock in eastern Germany was the same Czech pistol used in the previous four murders. But still the killers were not caught.
Two years and four victims later, the killings ceased and the case went quiet until last month when police who were chasing the robbers of a bank came across a burned out camper van with the corpses of Mundlos and Bhnhardt inside.

Paraskevidekatriaphobics, this is a bad year for you

BYLINE: Wade Malcom, The (Wilmington, Del.) News Journal

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 1A

LENGTH: 331 words

It's a bad year for people who suffer from paraskevidekatriaphobia -- the fear of Friday the 13th.
Why? There are three this year, instead of the usual two. There was one in 2011. 
That's not all. For the first time since 1984, those three Friday the 13ths -- today, April 13 and July 13 -- are exactly 13 weeks apart.
Three Friday the 13ths happen every few years. The last was in 2009, and the next is 2015. What's special about 2012 -- and what won't occur again until 2040 -- is that this is happening  during a leap year, says Tom Fernsler, a University of Delaware math professor who sometimes goes by the name Dr. 13.
It's hard not to feel something about Friday the 13th, Fernsler says. "I find that 95% of people in the world are superstitious about something, and the other 5% are liars," he said.
The number 13 and Friday are recurring presences in  mythological, spiritual and religious tradition. In Christianity, 13 people attended the Last Supper before Judas' betrayal and Jesus' death on a Friday. A Norse myth  warns of dire consequences for dining in groups of 13. Friday the 13th was the date the  medieval Knights Templar were imprisoned. And, though not as historic, rapper Tupac Shakur died  on Friday, Sept. 13, 1996, after being gunned down Sept. 7.
For many pagans,  13 is a lucky number, because it corresponds with the number of full moons each year, says Ivo Dominguez Jr., owner of Bell, Book & Candle, a pagan and occult book and gift shop in Dover, Del.
While Friday the 13th can feel special, it isn't. In a 400-year period, the 13th falls on a Friday more than any other day: 688 times, Fernsler says.
Fernsler has made it a hobby to find dates and events associated with the number 13, as well as Friday the 13th.  The day has hosted some famous births, such as Fidel Castro and Butch Cassidy.
Dominguez argues  Friday the 13th fears are "self-fulfilling prophecy," adding there's a "strong power in people convincing themselves something unlucky will happen."

A preliminary hearing began Sunday for an American soldier charged with abuse that led to the suicide of a 19-year-old fellow soldier in Afghanistan, the U.S. military said.
Army Spc. Ryan  Offutt is charged with offenses including maltreatment, assault, involuntary manslaughter and negligent homicide in the death of Pvt. Danny Chen, the military said. Offutt, whose hearing is being held in Afghanistan, is one of eight infantrymen charged in the case.
Chen, a New Yorker of Chinese decent, shot himself in a guardhouse Oct. 3  after what the military says were weeks of racial slurs, humiliation and physical abuse from members of his unit, the 3rd Battalion, 21st Infantry Regiment, 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division from Fort Wainwright, Alaska. 
The Article 32 hearing will determine whether Offutt will face a military trial, or court-martial.
Another hazing claim at Florida A&M
A band member at Florida A&M, a school still reeling from the hazing death of a drum major, said he was verbally harassed for not joining a subgroup of the band's trombone section known as "Thunder," a band staff member reported.
Staff member Robert Griffin wrote FAMU administrators and trustees saying the Marching 100 trombone player said last week he was repeatedly subjected to verbal harassment and decided he needed to report the incidents "before the situation became violent," the Tallahassee Democrat reported. In November, drum major Robert Champion died after a hazing ritual. An autopsy ruled the death a homicide. FAMU spokeswoman Sharon Saunders said the school remains "committed to ending hazing."

Alaska dig-out in need of diggers
The Alaska town of Valdez was looking to hire more people to help the effort to dig out from more than 322 inches of snow this winter.
More than 170 people have been recruited to help remove snow. City spokeswoman Holly Powers said  50 more workers are being sought, at $20.30 per hour, to replace those who are no longer available.
The National Weather Service said the city's snowfall is 168 inches above a normal winter snowfall. The weather outlook for the town is dry and windy for the  week.
Stakes rise in hunt for missing goat
The reward is up to $250 for a fugitive goat on the lam since giving his shepherds the slip from a Christmas nativity scene in Fergus Falls, Minn.
The goat, Curly, ducked out on his role at Bethlehem Church, and he has been on the town's most-wanted list ever since. Curly apparently made a brief appearance Tuesday, and residents gave chase but failed to nab him.
To bounty hunters lured by the cash reward, Curly's owner, Jim Aakre, has a tip: The trick is to sneak up on Curly when he has a limited escape route and then grab his horn or halter.

Injury, grief weigh heavily on Serena

BYLINE: Douglas Robson

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 8C

LENGTH: 389 words

Serena Williams kicks off her quest for a sixth Australian Open on Tuesday with a sprained left ankle that needs constant treatment and a meager two matches since reaching the U.S. Open final in September. 
Less conspicuous is the heavy heart the 13-time Grand Slam champion has brought to Melbourne.
Williams arrives less than a month since her family's longtime behind-the-scenes adviser, Kevin Davis, died from a brain tumor. Davis, 54, died two days before Christmas.
Williams, who has not spoken publicly about Davis' death, told USA TODAY that the loss had taken a toll.
"I've known him since I was like 8 years old, so it was really, really tough for us," she said Sunday of Davis, a lawyer who helped the family negotiate some of their biggest early sponsorship deals and remained a family friend, confidant and counselor. "That's been really, really hard on me."
Unlike the shooting death of her half-sister, Yetunde Price in 2003, Williams said she was thankful for the time to process Davis' illness.
"The fact that it took awhile for him to pass was better than all of a sudden," she added. "I don't know if that's selfish on my behalf, but I knew it was coming, and I expected it and I cried and cried and cried. When it happened, it was almost (a) relief that he was not in pain anymore."
As long as the ankle holds up, the 30-year-old star -- who opens Tuesday against No. 45 Tamir Paszek of Australia -- is used to playing beyond her expectations after limited match preparedness.
In 2007, the out-of-shape American stormed to the third of her five Australian Open crowns after missing the end of the previous season and having just three matches under her belt at the start of the season prior to Melbourne.
"When things are broken down there you have to go crazy and really fix it up there," she said, pointing first to her body and then to her head. "Matches help. But when you don't have matches, you have to go into it with a different mind frame, and the mind frame I'm in is that I don't need them."
Her longstanding hitting partner, Sasha Bajin, isn't concerned. "I think the picture is showing that she's fit and we worked hard," said Bajin, noting that Williams is fit after working in the offseason with training guru Mackie Shilstone and putting in hours on court. "She's always ready when she plays the big tournaments."

Missing man found alive on Mt. Rainier

BYLINE: John Bacon with staff and wire reports

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 606 words

A 66-year-old snowshoer who had been missing on Mount Rainier in Washington state since Saturday was found alive Monday by  rescuers.
Yong Chun Kim was alert, conscious and stable, national park spokeswoman Lee Taylor said. "As soon as we heard he was alive, my sister, his wife, praised God and said 'Hallelujah'," said Kim's sister-in-law, Sang Soon Tomyn.
Kim was leading a group on a snowshoe hike on the mountain when he slid down a slope and became separated from his party. He radioed the group twice to say he was OK. But when he failed to meet them in the parking lot, a search was launched. Temperatures dropped into the teens, winds whipped the mountain and 8 inches of snow fell  since Saturday, Taylor said. 
Much-needed fuel reaches Nome
Crews laid a hose along a half-mile stretch of Bering Sea ice and began  transferring 1.3million gallons of fuel from a Russian fuel tanker to iced-in Nome, Alaska.
Stacey Smith, of fuel supplier Vitus Marine, said the transfer could be finished within 36 hours if everything goes smoothly, but it could take as long as five days. A Coast Guard icebreaker had cleared a path through hundreds of miles of ice.
The city of 3,500 didn't get its last pre-winter fuel delivery because of a massive November storm. Without the  delivery, Nome would run out of fuel by March or April, Smith said.
Four dead in Fresno murder-suicide
A woman who shot her two children, their father and a cousin in Fresno before committing suicide took video of herself on her iPad as she smoked methamphetamine before the killings, police said Monday.
The apparent murder-suicide by Aide Mendez, 23, began Sunday  when she argued with the father of her  children, Eduardo Lopez, 33. Police found Lopez in critical condition with stab and gunshot wounds, police Lt. Mark Salazar said.
Police then  discovered Mendez had apparently killed herself, her boyfriend's cousin, Paul Medina, 27, as well as her two children, 17-month-old Aliyah Echeverria and Isaiah Echeverria, 3.
"We do know that drugs played a key role, but we don't know to what extent," Salazar said.  "She recorded herself on an iPad."
3,500-year-old tree burns in Florida
One of the world's oldest cypress trees caught fire and collapsed in central Florida, officials said.
Seminole County Fire Rescue spokesman Steve Wright says the 118-foot-tall bald cypress tree named "The Senator" burned for several hours. Wright said a 20-foot section of the top fell first and then the rest of the tree collapsed. The county parks department said ring samples showed the tree was about 3,500 years old. State Division of Forestry spokesman Cliff Frazier told the Orlando Sentinel that arson had been ruled out but the cause of the fire had not been determined.
Wikipedia blackout will protest bills
The online encyclopedia Wikipedia will black out its website Wednesday to protest anti-piracy bills before Congress, founder Jimmy Wales said.
The community-sourced information site that  sometimes draws more than 25 million visitors per day will shut down its English versions for 24 hours in protest of the Stop Online Piracy Act and the Protect Intellectual Property Act. The bills are designed to crack down on sales of pirated U.S. products overseas.
Other sites are planning similar protests, concerned the laws would "hold website owners liable for links to sources of illegal music and movie downloading, with a detrimental effect on free speech online," The Financial Times reported.

City holds gun buyback on holiday

BYLINE: Mark Curnutte, The Cincinnati Enquirer

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 230 words

For the first time on the King holiday, a coalition of ministries and neighborhood groups here Monday held a different kind of anti-violence event: a gun buyback. 
Organizers collected 50 operable guns of many types -- handguns, rifles, shotguns and a couple of sawed-off shotguns in a two-hour gift-for-guns exchange at BLOC Ministries.
The bait: $100 gift cards from Kroger, Target, Walmart and Meijer. Private donations and religious congregations paid for the $5,000 worth of gift cards.
"We ran out of gift cards, not guns," said Arthur Phelps of the  anti-violence group CIRV (Cincinnati Initiative to Reduce Violence), one of the buyback program's sponsors. "We had to turn people away."
The event was the first of its kind in the city since 2007 and was done in cooperation with Cincinnati police. Project Nehemiah's Ceasefire program, a ministry of the Church of the Living God,  organized the event. Ceasefire also sponsors regular prayer caravans to sites of homicides.
Church pastor Ennis Tait said plans are underway to hold buyback events quarterly throughout the city.
"Was today a success?" Tait asked.  "Even one gun is a success."
Organizers timed the event to the King holiday. "The people of this community must unite as one and stand up against apathy and the violence that is destroying out city," Tait said. "We are honoring Dr. King and his fight for non-violence."

Romney is key target in smaller GOP field; 
16th debate takes a sharper tone in S.C.

BYLINE: Jackie Kucinich

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 6A

LENGTH: 842 words

And then there were five.
The major Republican presidential hopefuls gathered for their 16th  televised debate Monday night in a field that was smaller in size -- former Utah governor Jon Huntsman had suspended his campaign a few hours earlier -- and sharper in tone as time seems to be running out to stop front-runner Mitt Romney.
Under fire for declining to release his tax returns, Romney said for the first time that he "probably" would do so in April, a conditional concession that could help defuse a rising issue. 
"Mitt, we need for you to release your income tax so the people of this country can see where you made your money," Texas Gov. Rick Perry demanded in the debate's opening minutes. "We can't fire our nominee in September. We need to know now" whether a contender is "a flawed candidate."
Later, Romney stopped just short of promising to do so. "I think I've heard enough from folks" about the issue, he said, saying previous nominees generally had done so in April, the month when tax returns are due. "That's probably what I would do," he said.
Of course, by then he hopes to have the nomination in hand.
For nearly two hours, Romney had to defend his record on abortion, his views on gun rights, his relationship to the super PAC supporting his candidacy and his history as CEO of the private equity firm Bain Capital. His rivals saw this debate and another scheduled for Thursday as perhaps their last, best chances to blunt his momentum from victories in this month's Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary.
If the Palmetto State primary Saturday makes it three in a row, even former House speaker Newt Gingrich says it would be hard to deny the former Massachusetts governor the nomination.
That's one reason the debate -- hosted by Fox News,  The Wall Street Journal and the South Carolina Republican Party -- featured a series of sharp exchanges, including among those trying to prevail as the challenger to Romney. Former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum and Gingrich clashed on what to do about the Social Security system, and both differed with Texas Rep. Ron Paul on foreign policy.
The audience contributed to the general tumult by clapping, cheering and booing in approval and disapproval.
Paul was put on the defensive for suggesting international law had been violated when U.S. Navy SEALs raided Osama bin Laden's compound and killed him. Amid boos from the audience, Paul said he wasn't against killing bin Laden but that when possible, international law should be followed.
"My point is if another country does to us what we do to others, we are not going to like it very much," he said. "Maybe we ought to consider a golden rule in foreign policy: Don't do to other nations what we don't want happening to us." He said bin Laden should have been arrested and put on trial.
Romney and Perry disagreed, and Gingrich called Paul's views "utterly irrational."
It was Romney who was at the center of most of the attacks. He generally kept his cool, responding calmly to criticism from Gingrich and Perry and touting his record in business, as governor and as head of the Salt Lake City Olympics.
"My record is out there; proud of it," he said, saying he could assure voters he was someone who "understood how the economy works."
Still, he responded icily in an exchange with Santorum about attack ads being aired by a pro-Romney "super PAC" called Restore Our Future.
"Gov. Romney's super PAC has put an ad out there suggesting that I voted to allow felons to be able to vote for president, because they said I allowed felons to vote," Santorum said heatedly. "I would ask Gov. Romney, do you believe people who are felons, who've served their time, who've exhausted their parole and probation, should they be given the right to vote?"
Romney began by denying he controlled the ads, financed by a group that election laws require be independent, when Santorum interrupted to demand he answer his question.
"We have plenty of time. I'll get there," Romney replied brusquely. "I'll do it in the order I want to do."
When he said he opposed giving those who had committed violent crimes the right to vote, Santorum shot back that Massachusetts law when Romney was governor did just that, and he didn't try to change it.
"Not only could violent felons vote after they exhausted their sentences, but they could vote when they were on probation and parole," Santorum said.
After the debate, Santorum told reporters that if Romney wanted to stop his super PAC from running an ad he would. "That's what presidents do," he said. "They stand up; they take responsibility."
For his part, Gingrich defended his criticism of Romney's record at Bain Capital, which sometimes bought companies and laid off workers. Romney cites his business experience, Gingrich noted: "If that's part of your campaign, then questioning it is equally legitimate."
In the parking lot outside the Myrtle Beach Convention Center, anti-Romney fliers were left on car windshields. "If you've been laid off, you've already met Mitt Romney," one read.

Pardon us, governor, but what were you thinking?

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 8A

LENGTH: 646 words

David Gatlin shot and killed his estranged wife, Tammy, in 1993 while she held their 2-month-old baby in her arms. Her friend Randy Walker was shot, too, but managed to survive. Gatlin was sentenced to life and was turned down for parole just weeks ago.
But Gatlin got lucky. This month, outgoing Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour pardoned Gatlin, along with more than 200 others -- including three rapists, a half-dozen armed robbers, six drunken drivers who had killed with their cars, and about a dozen murderers. 
The large number of violent criminals, the last-minute timing and the lack of public notice to victims' families have outraged Mississippians and the nation, prompting calls to reform pardon practices. The appropriate response shouldn't be to bar pardons, which serve a useful function if done right, but to try to ensure that they are done systematically, carefully and transparently, which doesn't appear to have been the case in Mississippi.
Under the U.S. Constitution, presidents have the authority to grant pardons, as do most governors under their state constitutions. In 29 states, including Mississippi, the power rests solely with the governor. In the others, it's vested in an executive board or shared with the governor.
Pardons are powerful tools that all but erase the crime committed. If a former convict is on probation or parole, the pardon ends supervision. Felons can once again vote. Murderers are again free to buy guns. This is why, according to political scientist P.S. Ruckman Jr., pardons are usually granted to non-violent criminals, people who long ago completed their sentences, and those who've had years to prove that they can lead productive, exemplary lives.
Used judiciously, pardons can be a safety valve to correct the inevitable mistakes made in the criminal justice system. They can free space in overcrowded prisons. Often, they are used to show mercy to former convicts who have earned it.
Last  year, for example, Washington Gov. Chris Gregoire, granted a pardon to Starcia Ague, who at age 15 participated in a break-in that ended with the homeowners being terrorized by her co-defendants. Since her release at 21,  Ague has earned a college degree, gotten a university research job, won a large network of supporters and is seeking a career in juvenile justice.
But other governors, and presidents, have not used their extraordinary power as wisely. Former president Bill Clinton's questionable, 11th-hour pardon of fugitive financier  Marc Rich, whose ex-wife had given fat donations to the Clintons and to Democrats, sparked a congressional investigation. Despite the need for changes in the process, nothing came of it, except perhaps that Clinton's successors have been stingy with pardons. George W. Bush granted just 189 in eight years; white criminals seeking Bush pardons were nearly four times as likely to succeed as minorities, according to an examination by ProPublica, a non-profit news organization. After three years, President Obama has granted 22 pardons.
Barbour, a popular conservative Republican who just completed his second and final term, staunchly defends his last-minute actions. He says that 90% of those pardoned were already out of prison; just 26 had their prison terms cut short, about half for medical reasons.
But among the other half,  five were murderers, one was an armed hijacker, and another was convicted of aggravated assault. Pardons for extraordinary violence require extraordinary reasons. Barbour has provided none, beyond his religious belief in redemption and the fact that five served as trusties (prisoners who earn privileges through good behavior) at the governor's mansion.
Barbour's judgment appears questionable at best. His abrupt mass release of killers is an advertisement for restricting the process in ways that assure pardons are awarded only to those who most deserve them.

'Justified' marshals forces for new season; 
Mobster brings Raylan some fresh Kentucky blues

BYLINE: Carol Memmott, USA TODAY

SECTION: LIFE; Pg. 2D

LENGTH: 673 words

Mags Bennett and her clan aren't the crime kings of Harlan County, Ky., anymore, but life won't get any easier for Deputy U.S. Marshal Raylan Givens.
Fans who love high body counts, fistfights, big guns and creative weaponry (a frying pan and an ice pick have their moments in Episode 1) will have a field day with Season 3 of FX series Justified, which returns tonight  (10 ET/PT).
"It sort of comes at you fast and feels like a lot of bodies dropping," says Timothy Olyphant, who plays the calculating but laid-back Givens. "I don't know how to explain that, other than it seemed like a good idea at the time." 
Last year, the series picked up a Peabody Award and four Emmy nominations, including a supporting-actress  win for Margo Martindale as Mags. That win, and the critical acclaim, may attract new fans this season; Season 2 averaged nearly 4 million viewers (including timeshifting), up 16% from Season 1.
In Season 2, Givens faced off against Mags, matriarch of the dope-dealing Bennett clan. At season's end,  Mags is dead. Raylan has been shot. Ava Crowder (Joelle Carter), Boyd Crowder's (Walton Goggins) partner in crime, has been shot, and Givens' ex-wife, Winona (Natalie Zea), is pregnant.
The new season kicks off with bullet wounds healing and the marshals dealing with new villains. "This is going to be a more violent season because of the nature of our new out-and-out crazy bad guy," says executive producer Graham Yost.
That would be Neal McDonough as Robert Quarles, a shot-caller for the Detroit Mob. "We came up with the Quarles character because we wanted to do a carpetbagger," Yost says. "We liked the idea of someone coming from outside Kentucky.  Someone who comes in and thinks they can show these backwoods hicks how to do crime right. We knew that would really stir things up."
The U.S. Marshals and Harlan's crime kingpin Crowder also face  the mysterious Ellstin Limehouse (Mykelti Williamson),  leader of fictional Noble's Holler, an African-American enclave founded by emancipated slaves after the Civil War.
Yost and writer Fred Golan  worked  on NBC drama Boomtown with McDonough and Williamson, "so we've got great affection for these guys and their work," Yost says.
One of the season's thematic goals, he says, is exploring the notion of what happens when you cross the line.
Boyd and Ava, adopting  Bonnie and Clyde personas, will cross lines as they expand their criminal empire. Givens' boss, Art Mullen (Nick Searcy), crosses the line while interrogating a killer, and Givens cross all kinds of lines as he carries out his day-to-day duties in his own unique way.
"Crossing the line, to some degree, is what has made these stories great from the beginning," Olyphant says. "We started with this character who lectured a neo-Nazi about the rules of knocking before entering."
No one admires Justified more than Elmore Leonard, whose books are the inspiration for the show. "I love the action. I think it's great," says Leonard, who gives high marks to tonight's episode. "There's this skinny, creepy guy  who Raylan confronts, who we all hate immediately, and you're just waiting for Raylan to nail him."
Their motel-room standoff ranks as one of the series' more clever moments. "It's amazing how much fun it is trying to figure out how many ways you can kill somebody," Olyphant says. "We're always looking for the opportunity to do something unexpected. Sometimes, something is so stupid that you think it just might be brilliant, and maybe that scene qualifies."
Leonard remains a constant source of inspiration for the cast and writers, but it works both ways. With encouragement from Yost and Olyphant, Leonard has written a novel, Raylan, also out this week. Elements from the book showed up last season, and the show's writers tap into more of the book's plot points this season.
"I dedicated the book to them, because they're carrying it," says Leonard, adding that it was his idea to have Olyphant grace the cover. "They're running with it, and I think it's terrific. I couldn't be more pleased."

OSHA: Airline must rehire whistle-blower

BYLINE: John Bacon with staff and wire reports

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 610 words

AirTran Airways must reinstate a pilot who was fired after a spike in the number of mechanical problems he reported, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration said Tuesday.
The agency also ordered the airline to pay more than $1 million to the pilot for back wages, plus interest and compensatory damages.
OSHA Assistant Secretary David Michaels said the airline violated whistle-blower protection laws when it terminated the pilot in 2007. "Retaliating against a pilot for reporting mechanical malfunctions is not consistent with a company that values the safety of its workers and customers," Michaels said. AirTran spokeswoman Whitney Eichinger declined to comment. The Labor Department does not release names of employees involved in whistle-blower complaints. 
Six questioned in videotaped beating
The videotaped beating of a teen in a Chicago alley did not appear racially motivated, and six teens are being questioned, police said.
The assailants can be heard repeating racial slurs and making derogatory comments about speaking Chinese. The assailants -- many with sweatshirt hoods over their heads and some wearing masks -- are seen repeatedly kicking and punching the 17-year-old victim Sunday. Police spokesman Mike Sullivan said the motive was robbery. The victim suffered cuts and bruises.
DEA agent who shot himself loses case
A federal agent who accidentally shot himself while lecturing kids on gun safety lost his appeal in a lawsuit over release of the video that subjected him to ridicule on late-night talk shows.
Lee Paige sued his employer, the Drug Enforcement Administration, after a video of the 2004 accident in Florida appeared in the news.  The video shows Paige shooting himself in the leg just as he tells a gathering of  youth and their parents, "I'm the only one in this room professional enough, that I know of, to carry this Glock 40."
A three-judge federal panel rejected Paige's claim that DEA's release of the video invaded his privacy and ended his ability to work undercover.
Bat death toll from fungus reaches 6.7M
A deadly fungus that has spread to 16 states has killed 6.7 million bats, biologists estimated.
"White-Nose Syndrome," discovered in 2006 in a New York cave, threatens some endangered bat species as well as more common bats that consume insect pests for farmers, the Center for Biological Diversity said. The death toll was agreed upon by biologists at the Northeast Bat Working Group's annual meeting in Pennsylvania. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is considering listing as endangered three more bat species under threat from the fungus.--Dan Vergano
It's official: Those rocks are from Mars
Fifteen pounds of rock collected in Morocco last month fell to Earth from Mars during a meteorite shower last July, scientists said.
A panel of meteorite experts, including some NASA scientists, confirmed test results based on the age and chemical signature of the rocks. Most other Martian meteorite samples sat on Earth for millions of years -- or at the very least, decades -- before  being discovered, which makes them tainted with Earth materials. "It's Christmas in January," said former NASA science chief Alan Stern, director of the Florida Space Institute at the University of Central Florida.

Abdul-Jabbar named cultural ambassador

BYLINE: Jeff Zillgitt

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 9C

LENGTH: 946 words

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Wednesday appointed Basketball Hall of Famer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar a cultural ambassador on behalf of the USA.
In that role, Abdul-Jabbar will travel the world and meet with young people "to promote education, understanding and tolerance," starting next week in Brazil.
"I remember when I was a kid and Louis Armstrong got to do somewhat the same thing for President Kennedy," Abdul-Jabbar said. "Following in his footsteps, one of my heroes, really makes me feel good." 
Abdul-Jabbar, who says he is doing "very well" in dealing with a rare but treatable form of leukemia, has a children's book due out at end of the month on African-American inventors titled, What Color is My World?
"All Americans need to know what black Americans have contributed. The earlier they know that the better," he said.-- Jeff Zillgitt
Former swim coach arrested in sex sting
The Osceola County (Fla.) sheriff's office says former swim coach Bryan Woodward was among those suspected of traveling to meet minors for sex in an undercover operation that has led to 40 arrests. The sting began Jan. 8 and ran through Monday, according to the Orlando Sentinel. Detectives posed online in chat rooms and instant messaging programs as children, parents or guardians. Officials said in some cases the suspects responded with pornographic images, and in others they brought alcohol or drugs to the meetings. Woodward, 29, coached with the Gator Swim Club in Gainesville, Fla. It is a private club that offers training programs for children of all ages and isn't affiliated with the University of Florida. Club owner Kathleen Troy told the Gainesville Sun Woodward no longer is with the team. Former PGA Tour golfer Steve Thomas also was arrested as part of the operation.
Indiana to review state hoops tourney
Indiana state Sen. Mike Delph of Carmel dropped a portion of a bill Wednesday that included a return to a single-class high school basketball tournament after reaching an agreement with Indiana High School Athletic Association Commissioner Bobby Cox to invoke public input on the topic. Delph, the bill sponsor, said the four-class system, in place since 1998, has failed and he expects the IHSAA to take a look at the system. Indiana's former one-class tournament is known because of the movie Hoosiers, a fictional account based on the 1954 state championship run by Milan, which had only 161 students.
Utah dismisses Watkins from team
Utah basketball coach Larry Krystkowiak dismissed point guard Josh "Jiggy" Watkins Wednesday for an undisclosed team rules violation. Krystkowiak had suspended Watkins earlier in the season for three days and one game, and subsequently had implemented a zero tolerance rule for players who were late to practice or missed meetings. The Utes have struggled in their first year under Krystkowiak and in the Pac-12. They are 4-13 overall and 1-4 in conference play. Watkins was the lone senior on Utah's active roster and was leading the Utes with 15.6 points and 4.8 assists a game. He hit the game-winner in overtime against Washington State on Jan. 5.
A Houston jury Wednesday acquitted former Southern University athletics director Greg LaFleur of soliciting prostitution. Police arrested LaFleur in April, accusing him of soliciting sex from an undercover officer posing as a prostitute. Southern fired LaFleur a few days later. LaFleur is suing the university, alleging breach of contract.
Man's bail raised for Winter Classic fight
A Philadelphia judge quadrupled the bail for a man charged with assaulting an off-duty police officer and Iraq war veteran in a fight between Philadelphia Flyers and New York Rangers fans following the NHL Winter Classic. Dennis Veteri, 32, of Glassboro, N.J., was held on $400,000 bail following Wednesday's hearing. Veteri was arrested last week in connection with the fight outside a cheesesteak shop. A video of the fight posted online shows a verbal confrontation escalate into a brawl that ends with a Rangers fan motionless on the ground. Police say Veteri was the aggressor and landed the punch that knocked out Neal Auricchio of Woodbridge Township, N.J.
British doping appeal to be in London
The hearing on Britain's lifetime Olympic ban for doping cheats will be held in London. The Court of Arbitration for Sport announced this month the hearing would be held March 12 but did not specify the venue. CAS usually holds hearings at its headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland, but also goes to London and New York when it is more convenient for both parties. The British Olympic Association filed an appeal to CAS last month, challenging a decision by the World Anti-Doping Agency to declare the British body "non-compliant" with global anti-doping rules. A verdict is expected in April.
Fatal shooting at U.S. soccer team's hotel
Vancouver police say a man was shot and killed Tuesday night at the restaurant of the hotel hosting the U.S. women's soccer team during the Olympic qualifying tournament. The U.S. delegation was safe, and none of its members witnessed the shooting. The USA opens tournament play Friday vs. the Dominican Republic.
The U.S. men's soccer team moved up one place to 33rd in the FIFA rankings. The ranking is the USA's highest since it was 31st in September. The USA had been 11th in September-October 2009 and reached a high of fourth in April 2006.
Briefly
The U.S. curling team of Korey Dropkin, Sarah Anderson, Thomas Howell and Taylor Anderson lost 7-5 to Italy and finished fifth at the Youth Olympic Games in Innsbruck, Austria.  Former Major League Baseball umpire Marty Springstead died Tuesday in Florida. He was 74.

Security screeners violated rules at JFK

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 574 words

Security screeners at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York violated procedures when they asked two elderly women to show them medical devices concealed by their clothing, Homeland Security officials admitted. 
In a letter to Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.,  Transportation Security Administration chief John Pistole and Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Betsy Markey said screeners at the airport will get refresher training on how to handle passengers with medical devices.
The action followed complaints by Lenore Zimmerman, 85, and Ruth Sherman, 88, that they were effectively strip-searched in November. Sherman said  female screeners made her lower her pants to  examine her colostomy bag.
Washington Monument gets $7.5M gift
David Rubenstein, a billionaire history buff, said he will donate the $7.5million matching gift that's needed to start repairing cracks near the top of the Washington Monument from last summer's East Coast earthquake.
Rubenstein, co-founder of the Carlyle Group private equity firm, said  he was inspired to help fund the repairs to the 555-foot obelisk when it became clear how severely damaged it was by a 5.8-magnitude quake on Aug. 23.
His gift is to be announced today. Congress allocated $7.5million late last year, expecting a matching amount to be raised privately.
Wisconsin governor draws challenger
Kathleen Falk, a Milwaukee native who ran unsuccessfully for Wisconsin governor in 2002, became the first Democrat to formally enter the race to replace Republican Gov. Scott Walker.
Falk's announcement came one day after 1million signatures were submitted on petitions seeking to recall Walker, who is under siege for championing legislation that  curtailed bargaining rights for public employees. If 540,000 signatures withstand challenges, an election could come this spring. Walker spokeswoman Ciara Matthews said Falk was "handpicked by big-government, public employee union bosses."
Lawyer arrested for gun at DFW airport
A lawyer was arrested  for carrying a loaded handgun aboard an American Airlines jet at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.
Judith Kenney, 65, was released  on her own recognizance, said her attorney,  David Finn. Kenney carries a handgun for protection but had forgotten that it was in her computer bag, he said.
Screeners detected a gun, but she "picked up the bag and left the checkpoint,"  said Greg Soule, a spokesman for the Transportation Security Administration. When  screeners spot a gun in a bag, they are  to seize the bag and notify police, he said. The plane, bound for Houston,  was headed for the runway when it returned to the gate and was met by airport police. Kenney is "absolutely mortified, embarrassed," Finn said. "She feels terrible for putting the pilot and passengers through all that."
Pentagon plan targets sexual assaults
The Pentagon is preparing a series of initiatives to try to curb sexual assaults in the military, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said.
He called the problem a "stain on the good honor" of the armed forces. Panetta said there were 3,191 sexual assaults reported in the military last year, up slightly from  3,158  in 2010. He said that because so few victims report the crime, the real number is closer to 19,000 assaults.

Support our fighting men; 
OPPOSING VIEW

BYLINE: Michael Savage

SECTION: EDIT; Pg. 6A

LENGTH: 335 words

Most of the "men" in the news media -- the same journalists  orchestrating the attack on Marines who allegedly urinated on Taliban terrorists they killed in battle -- have never even been in a fistfight, let alone a firefight. And yet here they are, piling on the real men who have the guts to go into combat against 15th century radical Islamist throwbacks. 
The piling on our Marines has done far more damage to the morale of our fighting men than our soldiers' actions. And yet we hear Marine Corps Commandant General James  Amos calling the act "inconsistent with (our) high standards of conduct," then whining about our commitment to "upholding the Geneva Conventions, the laws of war and our own core values."
This in the face of Taliban atrocities -- car-bombings, beheadings, the murder of women and children -- that flout the Geneva Conventions and yet are routinely ignored by the media and our military higher-ups, who also downplayed the Fort Hood massacre by Maj. Nidal Hasan.
Our fighting men must be supported at all costs at a time like this. How can we in good faith ask them to put their lives on the line against the vilest, most extreme of enemies while at the same time we attack them in the press at every turn?
I'm not saying that what these Marines did isn't a violation of military code. But unlike murderers who are granted appeal after appeal, these Marines have already been tried and found guilty in the media.
The desecration of war dead is universally condemned, but it is as old as war itself. These boys are not the devils. The Taliban fighters are the devils.
Our Marines are heroes. They should be rewarded for having the guts to go into combat, not punished for stepping over the line.
It's the latest attempt by the liberal news media and the increasingly timid military brass to destroy the few, the proud, the brave, the Marines. Remember, "to err is human, to forgive divine."

The starting five
1. Hot Tigers: No. 3 Baylor returns home to face another huge Big 12 test after falling from the ranks of the undefeated Monday at Kansas. This time the Bears are up against No. 5 Missouri on Saturday. The Tigers entered the week second in the nation in field goal accuracy and feature three-point marksmen Marcus Denmon and Kim English. But the Bears might find more favorable matchups inside, especially if Perry Jones III and Quincy Acy hit the offensive glass. 
2. Cool 'Cats: No. 2 Kentucky followed last week's close calls with a more convincing performance Tuesday against Arkansas. Saturday, the Wildcats host Alabama, which spent time in the Top 25 earlier in the season but faces a tough turnaround after losing to Vanderbilt by 10 on Thursday. Tony Mitchell and JaMychal Green figure to have their hands full for the Crimson Tide keeping UK's Anthony Davis from owning the paint.
3. Orange sizzle: No. 1 Syracuse puts its perfect record on the line Saturday as it begins  a series of tough road tests. The first stop for the Orange is Notre Dame. The Fighting Irish count Louisville among their home-court victims, but they enter on a two-game skid. They'll need Eric Atkins to rediscover his shooting touch to match Kris Joseph and the deep Orange lineup.
4. Desert heat: New Mexico heads to Las Vegas to meet No. 20 UNLV on Saturday in what is now a battle to stay within reach of red-hot San Diego State in the Mountain West. Mike Moser and the Runnin' Rebels got back on course after losing last week's squeaker to the No. 16 Aztecs. The Lobos must shake  memories of letting their contest with SDSU get away Wednesday in their venerable Pit, but Drew Gordon also has a double-double average.
5. In from the cold: Wisconsin hopes to work its way back toward the top of the rugged Big Ten. The Badgers look to run their winning streak to four at No. 25 Illinois to highlight a light Sunday slate. Wisconsin's traditionally stingy defense slipped a bit during  an earlier three-game slide but is now back to form. Most of their attention figures to be on streaky Illini G Brandon Paul.
Under the radar
You'll have to stay up late to catch Metro Atlantic leader Iona in action tonight (ESPNU, 10 ET) against Rider. But it might be worth your time to watch the Gaels' Scott Machado in action. The senior point guard leads the nation in assists at 10.3 a game. With F Mike Glover (19.0 points a game) and G Lamont Jones (15.1) reaping the benefits of Machado's feeds, Iona figures to be a tough out in March.
Number of the week
407. Career blocks for Northwestern State's William Mosley after he swatted six shots Wednesday at Texas-San Antonio,  good for 21st on the all-time list. If he gets three rejections Saturday at McNeese State, he'll overtake the late Kevin Roberson of Vermont and move into the top 20, becoming the shortest player (6-7) to do so.

Gay-marriage bill set for hearings in Wash.

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 560 words

Lawmakers in Washington state will hold their first public hearings today on legislation aimed at legalizing same-sex marriage.
Bills have been introduced in the state House and Senate, sponsored by two gay lawmakers. Gay marriage has won the backing of several prominent Pacific Northwest businesses, including Microsoft and Nike. The National Organization for Marriage, however, said it would spend $250,000 to help fund primary challengers to any Republican who votes for same-sex marriage. 
Gay marriage is legal in Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Vermont and the District of Columbia.
"If there's one word to sum up where Washington is on marriage equality, it's momentum," said Michael Cole-Schwartz, spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign, a gay advocacy group.
Three flight attendants hurt in flight
Three American Airlines flight attendants were injured because of turbulence on a Brazil-to-Miami trip, an airline spokeswoman said.
American spokeswoman Mary Frances Fagan said the flight attendants were injured "to some degree" during the flight, which landed Sunday evening in Miami.  Flight 980 from Recife Airport in Brazil  was carrying 136 passengers and nine crewmembers.
Les Dorr,  spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration, said the pilot declared a medical emergency after encountering turbulence at 36,000 feet in the vicinity of Belm, Brazil.
Miami International Airport spokeswoman Maria Levrant said the injured crewmembers were taken to local hospitals for treatment. No other information was given about  the injuries.
Report reviews deadly Ala. tornadoes
A panel appointed by Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley, a Republican, to study last year's deadly  tornadoes is set to deliver its findings today on how the state should respond to disasters.
The Tornado Action Recovery Council's report will include 20 recommendations regarding issues including storm shelters, warning systems and coordination between state agencies, The Birmingham News reported.
The April 27 tornadoes killed 248 people in Alabama and injured more than 2,000 others. They destroyed more than 7,800 homes.
Help is on the way after Nevada fire
The Federal Emergency Management Agency and other agencies will set up a field office in Nevada this week to provide assistance after a wildfire that destroyed 29 homes.
The fire, which began Thursday and was contained Saturday, had grown to more than 6square miles in a rural area with scattered small neighborhoods south of Reno.
"There is nothing left in some of those places except for the chimneys and fireplaces," Gov. Brian Sandoval said.
Jim Blueberg, 68, whose mother, June Hargis, 93, is believed to be the fire's only victim, said prosecuting the man who admitted to accidentally starting the blaze wouldn't "do any good."
Also
HILO, Hawaii -- A magnitude-5.0 quake and several small aftershocks shook Hawaii on Sunday, but there were no  reports of  serious damage or injuries. The quake struck near Kae'na Point  on the Big Island,  the U.S. Geological Survey said.
NEW ORLEANS -- The last of 20 police officers charged in a series of probes by the Justice Department's civil rights division faces trial today. Gerard Dugu is charged with taking part in a coverup to make it appear police were justified in shooting six unarmed people, killing two, on a bridge days after Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

Why U.S. politics devolves into good vs. evil; 
Without a clear 'devil' to rally against, Americans turn the knives on each other

BYLINE: Henry G. Brinton

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 9A

LENGTH: 1240 words

Political debate in the USA is more civil when we have a devil to oppose, whether it is Adolf Hitler, Nikita Khrushchev, or Osama bin Laden. National unity reaches its peaks in times of crisis, such as World War II, the height of the Cold War and the early days of the War on Terrorism. When the threat passes, though, watch out. Because we then turn on each other.
Remember the 1990s? After the Soviet Union fell and the Cold War ended, Americans began to rip each other apart in some of the nastiest political fights of the past 50 years. We lost our devil and began to bludgeon one another, fighting over the Contract with America, appointment of the House chaplain and impeachment trial of President Clinton.
Seeing life as a battle between absolute good and pure evil is a form of dualism that has a long history, appearing in the Middle East about 2,500 years ago. 
"A dualistic perspective on reality, claiming there is a pure evil force or person lurking out there, allows people to avoid blaming themselves or their own people for failures or frustrations they experience," says Matthew Skinner, associate professor of the New Testament at Luther Seminary in St. Paul. It is always easier to fight a devil "out there" than to do the hard work of solving our internal problems, as individuals and as a nation.
Needing a common enemy
The 9/11 attacks gave us a common enemy in the terrorists, and for a brief moment we were united. But that unifying moment passed quicker than you can say "Iraq War."
Osama bin Laden was a devilish character, and most Americans cheered when he was killed last year. But he was such a shadowy figure that I'm not sure he could have served as a rallying point for us. Bin Laden's messages were sporadic and unfocused, and over the years it was hard to tell whether he was even alive. Such foes unite us by giving us a focal point for our anger and aggression. But when the enemy disappears (or is hard to see), we demonize each other. Following our dualistic tendencies, we move toward the political extremes and begin to consider fellow citizens with opposing views to be our enemies. (See the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street movements.)
As comedian John Cleese has observed, "You can be as nasty as you like, and yet feel your behavior is morally justified. So, you can strut around abusing people and telling them you can eat them for breakfast, and still think of yourself as a champion of the truth, a fighter for the greater good, and not the rather sad paranoid schizoid that you really are."
That's what is happening now, as we move through the presidential primary season and then into the general election campaign. Candidates are putting tremendous amounts of time, energy and money into attacks on their opponents, while the blogosphere does what it does best: oozes with vitriol. "Super PACs" are fanning the flames with bucketloads of money, and the razor-edged ads that follow, and the cycle continues.
What we say we want
This political rage is growing in spite of the fact that  61% of Americans believe that the rude tone of U.S. politics is unhealthy for our democracy, according to a national poll in 2010 by the Center for Political Participation.
A reversal of this destructive trend will begin only when  we are energized and united by a battle against an evil that's seen as a common threat. This tendency is a part of our cultural makeup, rooted deeply in our religious traditions. As Susan  Garrett, professor of New Testament at Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary, points out, "New Testament authors sometimes portrayed enemies as under Satan's power," such as when Paul links "false apostles" to ministers of Satan (2 Corinthians 11:13-15), and when John associates a female prophet with teachings that he characterizes as "the deep things of Satan" (Revelation 2:20-25). In both cases, says Garrett, the enemies are most likely fellow Christians.
Such demonization helps us when we are fighting Hitler but hurts us when we are choosing the next president. So, like addicts who begin their recovery by honestly admitting that they have a problem, we need to accept the fact that we are drawn to a dualistic world view. It is a powerful and deeply rooted approach to life, but not the only one we can take. If we resist the temptation to see everything as good vs. evil, we will discover that there are no true devils in the race for the White House.
It's expected and within bounds for the Republican candidates to paint a less-than-flattering image of President Obama. That's fair politics. But calling the president a "socialist," as the now-sidelined Texas Gov. Rick Perry did, enters into the realm of demagoguery. Not to mention that the "socialist" label would come as a surprise to Barack Obama's most liberal supporters, who are deeply disappointed that he has turned out to be too moderate for their taste.
Of course, "a socialist" is less devilish than "the anti-Christ" -- a scurrilous label applied to Obama by the Idaho man who fired a gun at the White House  last November, and one that was suggested by a popular YouTube video in 2009.
Such demonization has continued in the just-completed South Carolina primary, as former House speaker Newt Gingrich attacked GOP front-runner Mitt Romney on the work he did as a venture capitalist at Bain Capital -- odd for a conservative to accuse his opponent of being too much of a capitalist -- and saying at midweek that the Romney campaign would "unendingly dirty and dishonest" ahead of the vote. (At least he stopped short of saying Romney's evil! And he won the primary!)
At the same time, Democrats are sharpening their knives and have made no secret they plan to attack the Republican nominee with devastating blows right up to Election Day in November.
Evil, not just wrong
I realize, of course, that a dualistic world view is an effective way to rally supporters and get out the vote. As Bill Reidway, a politically astute member of my congregation, said to me, "It's easiest to get votes when you can convince people the stakes are high -- that is, that the other side is evil, as opposed to just wrong."
Since good and responsible people know that they should never compromise with evil, they end up entering the polling place with a battle mentality. But such an approach only makes sense when Satan is running for president -- and despite what you might hear in the darkest recesses of the online world, Satan is not running in 2012.  It would be much better for us, as individuals and as a nation, if we saved our righteous anger for the devils that will inevitably appear again as external threats to our nation. Not that foreign foes are a guarantee of domestic tranquility. The McCarthy hearings and Red Scare of the 1950s caused American politics to go off-road and get nasty, even though we had a common enemy. And we always need to keep in mind that the enemies of one generation can morph into the allies of the next.
Better for us to put time, energy and money into fighting the evils that are afflicting us internally, whether we choose to focus on battling substance abuse, racism, sexual addiction, domestic violence or the disintegration of the American family. As always, these threats are harder for us to face, because the demons are inside.

Giffords to resign this week to focus on recovery; 
'I will return,' says Ariz. lawmaker shot in head a year ago

BYLINE: Susan Davis, USA TODAY

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 5A

LENGTH: 530 words

One year after a  gunman tried to take her life, Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords sat before a camera and announced  she would forgo re-election plans in order to focus on her ongoing recovery. 
Giffords' ability to deliver the message on her own is testament to a remarkable comeback following a year of rigorous treatment after a bullet tore through the left side of her brain, cutting short the political ambitions of one of the Democratic Party's rising stars.
"A lot has happened over the past year. We cannot change that. But I know on the issues we fought for, we can change things for the better," Giffords, 41, said in a video posted Sunday on YouTube  in which she struck a positive tone against a backdrop of images of her life before and after the Jan. 8, 2011, shooting rampage at a Tucson  event with constituents.
The shooting prompted a national debate about the coarsening of political discourse. In the wake of it, President Obama called on all Americans to engage in more thoughtful debate. "If this tragedy prompts reflection and debate, as it should, let's make sure it's worthy of those we have lost," Obama said in a Tucson speech eulogizing the six people who were killed. Thirteen  people, including Giffords, were wounded.
After the shooting, members of Congress ignored party lines and sat commingled  at the State of the Union speech in a symbolic show of bipartisanship -- a tradition that some lawmakers are seeking to make permanent. At least 100 lawmakers  have pledged to have bipartisan seatmates at President Obama's State of the Union Address  on Tuesday. Giffords will attend as one of her last acts in  Congress.
The shooting brought no lasting change to Capitol Hill. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was asked last week about  bipartisan seating plans. "Yeah, and look what a great year it produced," she quipped, adding: "I don't think it's silly, no ... but I'd just like to see some follow-through."
Giffords' message of centrism and unity was the focus of her retirement announcement. She will resign  this week, triggering a June election for her 8th District seat.
"We can do so much more by working together. I don't remember much from that horrible day, but I will never forget the trust you placed in me to be your voice," she said in the video. Giffords and her husband, former astronaut Mark Kelly, have become national figures, and Kelly has written a book, Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope.
Giffords told ABC in a November interview that she was not angry with  Jared Loughner, who was charged in the attack on  her "Congress on Your Corner" event. In a symbolic act of closure, Giffords said she plans to complete the interrupted  event by meeting privately with some constituents.
Loughner, 23, remains imprisoned amid legal battles concerning his mental competency to stand trial.
"I'm getting better," Giffords said. "Every day, my spirit is high. I will return, and we will work together for Arizona and this great country."
Giffords did not say whether she intends to seek political office again, but Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., a close friend,  said she was "confident that she will return to public service."

Chastain's time to shine; 
Prolific actress easily melts into wildly diverse roles

BYLINE: Andrea Mandell, USA TODAY

SECTION: LIFE; Pg. 1D

LENGTH: 1350 words

Jessica Chastain's best disguise these days is to walk around looking exactly like herself.
"No one ever recognizes me," says the actress, who was almost as omnipresent as buttered popcorn in movie theaters last year. Settling in for a vegan  lunch at Shutters hotel, with her hair pulled back in a loose ponytail and wearing only light makeup, the redhead describes  requesting a quiet table from the restaurant host for her interview.
"And he goes: 'Oh, OK. Good luck with your interview. I hope you get the job.'" She grins. "And I go, 'oh, it's not that kind of interview, it's a journalist.' And then he goes, 'So you're interviewing her?'" Chastain dissolves into giggles, but the host wasn't through. "Oh, you're a writer?" he asked. "It just kept getting worse and worse," she said, laughing. "It happens all the time." 
In fact, Chastain, 30,  may be one of the most prolific actors working today: In 2011 she had seven films open, and five more are scheduled for release or production in 2012. "Usually an actor has to work in the porn industry to have that kind of success," cracked her Tree of Life co-star Brad Pitt onstage at the Palm Springs Film Festival gala earlier this month.
Chastain's blockbuster year was hardly planned; six years of her work rolled out into theaters last year, thanks to various production delays and studio rescheduling.
"I was excited that my films would finally see the light of day and people would see them," she says. "But I never imagined that such nice things would be said about a lot of my films."
A nominee at the Golden Globes and the Critics' Choice Awards, Chastain was recently honored by both the New York Film Critics Circle and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association for her body of work in 2011. She has been praised for holding her own as Pitt's  wife in the existential film The Tree of Life, switching her hips and smiling nervously as The Help's doe-like Celia Foote, hunting a Nazi doctor as a Mossad agent  in The Debt and awaiting the apocalypse in Take Shelter.
Her "crazy" debut moment came last May when Chastain walked down Cannes' red carpet, gripping the hands of Tree of Life co-stars  Pitt and Sean Penn. With all cameras trained on the trio, Chastain recalls the long yellow gown that hid her shaking legs, and the murmurs of her co-stars through their steady smiles, "OK, smile, now we're going to turn around.  OK, Jessica."
"That walk was a defining moment," she says. "And there were all those comments like, 'Who is this girl, and why does she get this moment?' And you want to be like, 'I've worked so hard! I swear, I'm not coming out of nowhere!'"
Pacino gave her a break
Raised in a San Francisco suburb  by a firefighter and a homemaker, Chastain had no connection to the entertainment industry. "I grew up poor," Chastain says. "I still drive my old car. It takes me a long time to make a big purchase."
Today her mother is waiting nearby, having come to town to help Chastain  host a garage sale at  her home in Venice Beach. "She was the opposite of a stage mom. She was never going to take me to L.A. to do commercials," Chastain says of her  upbringing with her two brothers and two sisters, none of whom are actors.
After attending Juilliard on a scholarship, Chastain found a talent scout in Al Pacino, who  cast her in one of her first big plays, Salome,  in 2006. He then  cast her in the film version, Wilde Salome, which also premiered last year.
"I feel like he's my acting godfather," she says. "I got to be onstage with him and then watch him change his performance for a camera. And also he directed me." She shakes her head. "It was like Al Pacino was my acting coach for a year."
Pacino calls her a prodigy. "I never will forget that audition," he says. "You rarely see something where you know where someone's going to go," he adds, comparing Chastain to Meryl Streep. "She reminds me (of her), she can go that far into character."
Indeed, Chastain's ability to melt into work is becoming her calling card.
For Tree of Life, Pitt shot with Chastain for six weeks and says he knew only the  character she created.  "So to me, she was always Mrs. O'Brien," Pitt says. "I was actually surprised to meet her afterward, because you see her and she's got such a vibrant and lovely personality.
"I'm rooting for her," Pitt adds. "She's special."
Tom O'Neil of the awards website GoldDerby.com says he would be "flabbergasted" if Chastain  doesn't land an Oscar nomination Tuesday  for her role in the big-screen adaptation of Kathryn Stockett's novel The Help. Chastain's curvy, clueless Celia develops a friendship with her outspoken maid, Minny, played by Octavia Spencer. Chastain and Spencer are  up for the supporting-actress award at the Screen Actors Guild Awards on Sunday.
Chastain says shooting The Help  was the best time she has ever had on set.  "Because I love Octavia Spencer.  Every day it was laughing and being silly and cooking and all these things that Celia would be."
Plus, she got to play the bombshell. "I'm not the girl that wiggles when I walk. I've never done that. I've never been like that girl -- the bombshell." Here, Chastain pauses, unsure of how to phrase her next statement.  "This is a business that in the beginning does not perhaps celebrate that I look different. It takes someone to say 'Oh, this person is interesting because they don't look like everyone else, and that's special.'"
The Help's director, Tate Taylor, was one of those people.
"I didn't want somebody to play Jessica Rabbit, bombshell dumb girl," says Taylor, who saw hundreds  vying to be Celia. "She was the only actress who fully understood and embodied that fragile insecurity that was needed that people could relate to."
More diverse roles ahead
If critics and audiences are beginning to recognize Chastain  for her on-screen vulnerability (which she lightly disputes, pointing to her character's "mama bear quality" in Take Shelter or her  Mossad agent in The Debt), they should prepare for myriad personalities  from her in 2012.
First, she's reciting Shakespeare in Coriolanus (in theaters now) as Ralph Fiennes' wife, Virgilia ("She came highly recommended," Fiennes says). "She's like the feminine energy in this world of masculine violence," Chastain says. She'll also voice Gia, an Italian jaguar, in Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted (due in June), followed by Guillermo del Toro's Mama, in which she plays a punk-rock bassist who "has to take care of these two kids that she really wants nothing to do with," she says.
She'll switch gears  again this August in the gangster period film Wettest County, playing tough, sexually dominant Maggie, a woman mixed up with bootleggers in Virginia.
But this fall may be her most nerve-racking yet. Chastain will make her Broadway debut in  a revival of The Heiress. Based on the Henry James novel Washington Square, the title role has  been played by Broadway favorites Jane Alexander (in 1976) and Cherry Jones (who won a Tony for the 1995 version).
"It's really big shoes to fill," Chastain admits.
Ask Chastain what the secret to her success is, and the actress pauses.
"I believe that it's come from not following the money.  The people  I work with, I'm such a fan of. I've seen other things that they've directed and acted in, and I want to be there because I want to learn from them."
The single actress concedes she is  unsure  how to cultivate a  relationship with her nomadic lifestyle: "It's just been a tricky thing to navigate."
So are the politics of her next film. Chastain is  preparing  for Kathryn Bigelow's controversial follow-up to The Hurt Locker, which starts production next month in Jordan and chronicles the killing of Osama bin Laden.
Eventually, there's a Hawaiian vacation with Chastain's name on it. Until then, she'll just reflect on a dizzying year.
Last year "was one of my favorite years I'll probably ever have in my whole life. It's a very strange thing. My whole life I've wanted to be an actor, and it was the culmination of that dream.
"I know it sounds corny, but it's almost like seeing your younger self and realizing: You did it!"

After attacks, Nigerian president vows to stop sect

BYLINE: The Associated Press

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 7A

LENGTH: 366 words

Nigeria's president vowed on Sunday to go after a radical Islamist sect that used guns and bombs to kill more than 150 people in terrorist attacks that have nearly plunged the largest nation in Africa into civil war. 
Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan arrived in Kano on Sunday afternoon to express his condolences as military helicopters flew overhead and armed soldiers policed the streets.  Jonathan's government has been unable to stop attacks by the group Boko Haram, whose name means "Western education is sacrilege" in the Hausa language of Nigeria's north.
"Our coming today is to express our condolence to the good people of Kano over the dastardly acts," Jonathan, a Christian, said at the palace of the emir, the city's Muslim figurehead.
"Those causing havoc will never succeed," he said. "We will not rest until these terrorists are wiped out."
The terrorist group has carried out increasingly sophisticated and bloody attacks in its campaign to implement sharia, strict Islamic law, in a nation of 160 million people where the north is predominately Muslim, the south Christian.
Friday's attacks by Boko Haram hit police stations, immigration offices and the local headquarters of Nigeria's secret police in Kano, a city of more than 9 million people that remains an important political and religious center in the country's Muslim north. The attacks were Boko Haram's deadliest assault since beginning its campaign of terror.
United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon condemned the attacks. "The secretary-general is appalled at the frequency and intensity of recent attacks in Nigeria, which demonstrate a wanton and unacceptable disregard for human life," Ban spokesman Martin Nesirky said.
Ban expressed "his hope for swift and transparent investigations into these incidents that lead to bringing the perpetrators to justice."
A Boko Haram spokesman, Abul-Qaqa, said the attack was retaliation for  the government's refusal to release its jailed members. Authorities blamed Boko Haram for at least 510 killings last year, including an August suicide bombing on the U.N. headquarters in the country's capital, Abuja. This year, the group has been blamed for at least 219 killings.

Patriots give owner Kraft Super feeling; 
Team has title shot in season dedicated to late wife

BYLINE: Jon Saraceno, USA TODAY

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 1C

LENGTH: 1302 words

In the days leading to the AFC Championship Game, Robert Kraft shared how much joy the 2011 version of the New England Patriots provided him during a season of sometimes unbearable grief.
Myra Kraft, the NFL owner's often-acknowledged "sweetheart," died last July after a  battle with cancer. The Krafts were married for 48 years.
"This team," the owner told news reporters, "has been my savior."
Sunday, the Patriots gave their 70-year-old owner more to savor -- a sixth  Super Bowl  in the Kraft era.  His players  -- sporting MHK patches Sunday in honor of Myra Kraft -- doused their owner  in delight when they outlasted the Baltimore Ravens and escaped with a  23-20  victory. 
Kraft's Patriots will get a rematch of their shocking Super Bowl XLII loss when they face the New York Giants in Indianapolis on Feb. 5. The Giants were 20-17 overtime winners vs. the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Championship Game.
After Ravens kicker Billy Cundiff hooked a potential game-tying 32-yard field goal attempt in the closing seconds, the silver-haired patriarch of the Patriots dynasty leaped out of his seat in his owner's box and began hugging family and friends.
Kraft, who regularly consulted his wife regarding organizational matters, purchased the then-moribund franchise in 1994.
The Brookline, Mass., native transformed the franchise into a powerhouse, though in recent seasons the team's  fortunes have faltered.
The Patriots captured three Lombardi Trophies between the 2001-2004 seasons and, after the 2007 season, they marched into their final postseason game with a 17-0 record. But the Giants, whom Patriots coach Bill Belichick worked for from 1979 to 1990, upset New England 17-14 in one of the biggest stunners in Super Bowl history.
The good news for Patriots fans during what has been a topsy-turvy season: Quarterback Tom Brady played his poorest game of the season Sunday -- and New England still won.
Brady failed to throw a touchdown pass, was intercepted twice and posted a season-low 57.5 passer rating -- his worst statistical day since 2009.
In the meantime, the  resilient Patriots will make plans  for Super Bowl XLVI  after a four-year hiatus.
A win by the Patriots would give Brady 17 playoff victories, breaking the NFL record for quarterbacks he shares with his boyhood idol, Joe Montana of the San Francisco 49ers.
Meanwhile, the team's love affair with New Englanders of all stripes and Patriots past and present continues.
When former Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe, who presented the Lamar Hunt Trophy to Kraft on the field, approached the owner, he said, "Love you, buddy."
Bledsoe then planted a soft kiss on the owner. To which Kraft replied, "I've got two cheeks." Bledsoe willingly obliged and kissed the other cheek.
"Thank you for the support you have given us in this emotional year," the misty-eyed owner said over the loudspeaker to Patriots fans as confetti rained down at Gillette Stadium.
Brady: 'Our defense saved us'
Belichick, wearing his trademark  sweatshirt, typically was subdued. A passerby wouldn't  have been able to determine, from his words or expression, whether his team  had won or lost.
"We fought until the final gun," Belichick said.
And Brady?
"Well," he said, "I sucked pretty bad today, but our defense saved us.  We're going to try and go out and kick some butt in a couple of weeks."
The NFL's three-headed owner-coach-quarterback monster realized it was fortunate to return to the Super Bowl. Sunday's win was the Patriots' 10th in a row.
For Belichick, the team's 59-year-old relentless taskmaster, and Brady, his 34-year-old seven-time Pro Bowl quarterback, the victory delivered a tempered measure of vindication against the Ravens.
Two years ago, the Ravens soared into Gillette and picked apart the Patriots. Baltimore seized a 24-0 lead in the first quarter of their wild-card matchup and polished off a 33-14 thrashing.
This time, Brady and Co. jumped the Ravens for a quick 3-0 first quarter lead, but the Ravens' stingy defense continually forced New England's conference-leading offense to settle for Stephen Gostkowski field goals (three).
Surprisingly enough, it was the Patriots' oft-maligned defense -- ranked last in the AFC -- that bailed out Belichick and Brady. The play of the game came in the final minutes and moments before Cundiff's miss: Patriots defensive back Sterling Moore smacked the football out of receiver Lee Evans' grasp in the end zone.
"We left it all on the field and gave it our best,"  quarterback Joe Flacco said.
Sunday's game see-sawed with New England uncharacteristically committing three turnovers as Baltimore's  defense effectively slowed the Patriots' usually dangerous no-huddle offense.
With Baltimore leading 20-16 in the fourth quarter, Brady appeared to score on a quarterback sneak. However, the touchdown was overturned upon officials' review. The Ravens then stopped BenJarvus Green-Ellis on his third-down leap at the goal line.
On fourth down, Brady quickly went airborne, his arms and the football piercing the goal line for the go-ahead score, even as Ravens punishing linebacker Ray Lewis drilled him in his  back with his helmet. The two had sparred verbally earlier in the game.
Brady exalted by spiking the football -- hard. The Patriots led 23-20.
Flacco and Brady traded interceptions in the final eight minutes before Ravens coach John Harbaugh passed on what would have been a 51-yard field goal attempt by Cundiff on fourth-and-6 from the Patriots 33 with 2:53 remaining. After a Ravens timeout, a Flacco pass sailed out of bounds.
However, the Patriots offense bogged down again, setting up the Ravens' final opportunity with 1:44 remaining before Cundiff's miss.
While the Patriots dedicated the season to Myra Kraft, the resulting trip to the Super Bowl was anything but a foregone conclusion.
Slow start to 2011
After a 5-3 start that included the signing and releasing of several players, some critics began to question Belichick's stewardship.
Back-to-back defeats against the Pittsburgh Steelers and Giants included a sideline blowup between Brady and offensive coordinator Bill O'Brien -- plus the Patriots' sieve-like defense -- prompted more criticism. But team chemistry began to slowly evolve.
When it came to Belichick, Kraft had heard the critics' wails before. Some advised against hiring the coach in January 2000. He did as had done before: He  followed his instincts.
Sunday's triumph gave the duo of Belichick & Brady 16 playoff victories, two more than the former Steelers coach-quarterback team of Chuck Noll and Terry Bradshaw.
"I don't think anybody can question that this is the greatest coach-quarterback combination in the history of football -- it really is," ESPN's Mike Ditka said on-air Sunday.
The Kraft husband-wife team worked pretty well for nearly five decades, too. A commissioned painting of the owner's late wife was given to him by the team on Christmas Eve. The painting depicts a huddle of Patriots, with arms outstretched in unison, pointing toward the initials MHK.
In the final days of Myra Kraft's life, Robert Kraft shuttled back and forth to New York at his wife's insistence for negotiations aimed at ending the NFL lockout. By all accounts, Kraft played a key role in ending the stalemate. His wife died less than a week after a deal for a collective bargaining agreement was reached to end the  lockout.
Shortly thereafter, Kraft held a team meeting and said that the organization would be dedicating the season to the memory of his deceased spouse.
A season that began with great personal loss for Kraft has led the Patriots to the brink of football supremacy  and, perhaps, continued healing.
"Sometimes, a few (players) come through (the locker room) and they touch the (MHK) patch and say, 'That one was for Mama,'" Kraft said last week. "I hope we keep it going."

Injuries painful in short season

BYLINE: Jeff Zillgitt; Rachel Shuster

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 6C

LENGTH: 465 words

Maybe  Miami Heat guard Dwyane Wade, who has a sprained right ankle, and Chicago Bulls guard Derrick Rose, sprained left big toe, would have played if it were playoff time. 
But with a  66-game season packed into four months, some teams are taking a cautious approach with injuries so they don't turn into season-long issues for players.
The Heat have gone 6-1 without Wade,  so there's no reason to get the All-Star back before he's ready. Rose, who said his toe might bother him all season, started Monday against the New Jersey Nets after missing four games.
"We will never get them back earlier than they're ready. If they have to miss games, they miss games," Oklahoma City Thunder coach Scott Brooks said of his injured players.
It is a Catch-22 for Boston Celtics coach Doc Rivers. He doesn't want guard Rajon Rondo's sprained right wrist "to be a thing where he goes in, gets hurt again, then he's out more games again."  Yet at 7-9, including Monday's 87-56 victory vs. the Orlando Magic, the Celtics  also need wins to make the playoffs. Boston won without Rondo, Ray Allen (jammed ankle), Keyon Dooling (knee injury), Mickael Pietrus (shoulder) and Chris Wilcox (calf).
Keeping players fresh is also a challenge. Indiana Pacers coach Frank Vogel decided to stay in Los Angeles an extra night  instead of taking a  red-eye flight home after a 98-96 victory Sunday vs. the Los Angeles Lakers.
"We haven't done this in the past," Vogel told The Indianapolis Star. "We always struggle in the first game back from the West Coast trip. In my mind, I wanted to try something different   especially with the quick turnaround"  facing Orlando today.
Lakers' woes: The Lakers have gone 11 games without scoring 100 points, their longest such stretch since 12 games in 2003-04. Sunday was their third game in four days. They lost all three while averaging 87.7 points and shooting 40.7% overall and 28.6% from three-point range. The Lakers are last in the league in three-point shooting at 25.6%.
Los Angeles, tied for second for most games played (18) entering Monday's slate, had the 10th best record in the Western Conference under new coach Mike Brown.
"We've had a loaded schedule here to start, so hopefully that had something to do with our poor shooting," Lakers guard Kobe Bryant said after Sunday's loss to the Pacers. "I think some of the guys just need time off just to get their legs back."
Also: Guard Baron Davis, who has been out with a herniated disk in his back, got in his first practice Monday with the New York Knicks, who have lost six in a row.  Kevin McHale, a former Minnesota Timberwolves executive and a Minnesota native son, returned Monday as the Houston Rockets coach and was booed in his team's 107-92 win. He succeeded current Timberwolves coach Rick Adelman in Houston.

Gadhafi fighters seize city; 
Taking of Libyan town raises concern about loyalist networks

BYLINE: The Associated Press

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 9A

LENGTH: 519 words

Moammar Gadhafi loyalists seized control of a Libyan mountain city in the most serious challenge to the central government since the leader's fall as Libya's Western-backed rulers try to unify the country under their authority. 
The taking of Bani Walid, one of the last Gadhafi strongholds captured by the new leadership late last year, was the first such organized operation by armed remnants of Gadhafi's regime. A simultaneous outbreak of shootings in the capital and Libya's second-largest city, Benghazi, raised authorities' concerned that other networks of loyalists were active elsewhere.
The security troubles add to the difficulties of the ruling National Transitional Council, which is struggling to establish its authority and show Libyans progress in stability and good government. Bani Walid's fall comes after violent protests in Benghazi, where Libyans angry over the lack of changes stormed the NTC headquarters and trashed offices.
In Bani Walid, hundreds of well-equipped and highly trained fighters from Gadhafi's forces battled for eight hours on Monday with the local pro-NTC revolutionary brigade, known as the May 28 Brigade, said Mubarak al-Fatmani, the head of Bani Walid local council. The brigade was driven out, and Gadhafi loyalists then raised their old green flag over buildings in the western city.
There were no immediate signs that the uprising was part of some direct attempt to restore the family of Gadhafi, who was ousted in August and then killed in October in the city of Sirte.
Instead, the fighting seemed to reflect a rejection of NTC control by a city that never deeply accepted its rule. The May 28 Brigade had kept only a superficial control over the city, the head of Bani Walid's military council, Abdullah al-Khazmi, acknowledged.
"The only link between Bani Walid and the revolution was May 28. Now it is gone, and 99% of Bani Walid people are Gadhafi loyalists," he said.
He spoke at a position on the eastern outskirts of Bani Walid, where hundreds of pro-NTC reinforcements from Benghazi were deployed with convoys of cars mounted with machine guns.
A month ago, Gadhafi loyalists attacked another revolutionary brigade from Tripoli that entered Bani Walid, killing 13, al-Fatmani said.
"The council (NTC) did absolutely nothing," said al-Fatmani, who resigned from his post as local council chief to protest the NTC's failure to investigate the ambush.
Bani Walid, a city of 100,000 located in the mountains 90 miles southeast of Tripoli, held out for weeks against revolutionary forces after Gadhafi's fall from power. Loyalist fighters dug into its formidable terrain of valleys and crevasses. Pro-NTC fighters finally took it in October.
The main tribe in Bani Walid is a branch of the Warfala tribal confederation, which stretches around the country with about 1 million members. The Bani Walid branch was one of the most privileged under Gadhafi, who gave members top positions and used their fighters to crush protesters in the early months of last year's uprising.
"The hatred and mistrust have been building up during the revolution," said Ali al-Fatmani, a Warfala.

Time to rein in spending on political campaigns

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 10A

LENGTH: 247 words

I agree with the letter  "Put cap on spending for political campaigns" published Wednesday.  Money poisons politics. Federal financing of campaigns would certainly help. 
In light of the way votes are bought with  obscenely large contributions, we really do not have a democracy today. We must address this issue and also the length of time that we are inundated with political rhetoric.

Misconduct in war
Spare me the righteous indignation of those who have never heard a shot fired in anger ("Marines deserve punishment, not acclaim, if they desecrated Taliban," Our view, Military misconduct debate, Friday).
Our president has directed the killing of suspected terrorists, including American citizens, without due process -- likely a violation of the Geneva Conventions. And now there is a demand for  the scalps of Marines accused of  giving dead Taliban a golden shower? They deserve an Article 15, non-judicial punishment with loss of a stripe and 30 days' pay, for bad judgment: videotaping the event. Get real!

Actions are disgraceful
Radio talk show host Michael Savage's justification of a few Marines' loathsome conduct is indefensible ("Support our fighting men," Opposing view).  The Marines convicted themselves,  with a video allegedly showing  their act. To justify this "violation of military code" denigrates every Marine who honorably donned a uniform. Shame.

'You can't expect anything'
Alexander Payne, 50, director, The Descendants
Payne was having a bellissimo
kind of day.
"I was already having a good
day because I was touring
Cinecittא Studios for the first
time in my life," Payne says,
calling from Rome. Payne
found out in cinematic fashion
--from a stranger. "I don't have 
my phone with me. I was in my
car pulling into Cinecittא
Studios, and a guy who was my host got into the
front seat, turned around and said, 'Oh, congratulations
on your nominations!' And I said, 'What
nominations?' "
But with so many Oscar prognosticators predicting
his nomination was in the bag, didn't he expect
it? "I had some inkling that the film might get three
or four nominations, but of course you can't expect
anything, because if it doesn't happen, you've set
yourself up for disappointment."
'I feel such a sense of celebration'
Glenn Close, 64, actress, Albert Nobbs
For Close, having friends
such as Janet McTeer nearby
(best supporting actress, Albert
Nobbs) made her nomination
for the film even sweeter.
"She's here. We're having the
best time," Close says. "It's
really great. I wish I could be
with our entire company."
Close says her Damages
schedule is going to prevent
the celebratory Champagne from flowing. "Unfortunately.
Except, you know what? I just thought
of this. The last scene that we're shooting, Rose
(Byrne) and I have gotten into the whiskey. So
maybe I can do it for real," she says, laughing.
Has it hit her yet what fighting so hard to make
Albert Nobbs has accomplished? She sighs. "I feel
such a sense of celebration. I feel like we represent
this amazing team that enabled us to pull it off.
When I sit back and let myself think about the fact
that we didn't give up and we kept at it and we
made this movie, and here we are with three Oscar
nominations, it's amazing."
Was it all just a sick dream?
Demiבn Bichir, 48, actor, A Better Life
A fever forced Bichir to
question if his nomination was
real or a hallucination: "I've
been trying to get some sleep
because I'm in previews right
now in Mexico City for a play
that I'm rehearsing," says
Bichir, who's now starring in
and co-producing a revival of
Swimming With Sharks. "And I
got really sick last night, and I
was having some fever, because I was going
through some hallucinations. And I was dreaming
all kinds of crazy things, because I knew the nominations
were going to be announced today." It was
Bichir's girlfriend who called and awakened him at
7:30 a.m. with the real, very good news.
Bichir planned to celebrate at rehearsal, fever or
not: "And I'm going to get everyone drunk. . . .
I don't know how bad I am, but I feel like a
(expletive) million dollars right now."
Result of a 'really difficult' transition
Jonah Hill, 28, supporting actor, Moneyball
In the five years since Hill
broke out in Superbad, his
rise to the A-list has been
meteoric, a stunning fact
not lost on him.
"It's really, really difficult for
anyone known for comedy to
be known for anything else. To
make that transition, there's
only a few actors who have
done that."
But that doesn't mean he has turned his back on
comedy. Next up ? A 21Jump Street feature-film
reboot with Channing Tatum. "It's a big, huge,
crazy action comedy that I will not be nominated
for an Oscar for."
'Just another day' for Hollywood vet
Christopher Plummer, 82, supporting actor,
Beginners
Oscar nomination? No big
deal for a veteran such as
Plummer, whose career spans
55 years.
"It's just another day.We
celebrate every day all the
time. Awards or no awards,
life is a celebration."
But he's certainly not
ungrateful. "It's lovely to be
nominated. It's thrilling. I'm
very happy, but it's a lot of hard work," he adds.
"It's exhausting because there's so many (awards
shows), and it seems that there's more every year!
It's fun to see old friends."
Even this shoo-in 'got really nervous'
Octavia Spencer, 39, supporting actress,
The Help
A supporting-actress nomination
might have seemed like
a sure thing for the breakout
star (after all, she has won the
Golden Globe and Critics'
Choice awards this season),
but Spencer wasn't so sure.
"Can I be honest? I sat up
today, and I got really nervous
when they got down to the
last names. And I thought,
'This is why we don't get ahead of ourselves!'
I didn't know. I hoped."
Spencer bumped into castmate and fellow nominee
Viola Davis (actress, The Help) in the lobby of
the Four Seasons just after they'd both gotten the
news Tuesday morning.
"She is glowing. I'm so thrilled for her," Spencer
says. "She was the glue on that set. She is an amazing
Juilliard-trained actress who is finally getting
to show the world what she can do."
'I'm floored' by first nomination
Gary Oldman, 53, actor, Tinker Tailor
Soldier Spy
"I'm a bit--I'm in shock a bit.
I'm dumbfounded. I'm floored
by the news," the first-time
nominee says.
"I've broken my record (of no
Oscar nominations) now. I was
holding that record, but no
more, and really, it's thrilling,
Imust say. Now I know what
all those other nominees felt
like: completely in shock."
Oldman paid it forward with a call to his sons
before they left for school. "I put them on speaker,
and I said, 'Papa's been nominated for an Oscar.' "
'Pancakes for everyone this morning!'
Brad Pitt, 48, actor, Moneyball
The Jolie-Pitt kids were extra
excited for Pitt's nomination.
"This morning, they're just
gonna be wondering, 'Why is Dad
letting me have whatever I want?'
Fruit Loops, Cocoa Puffs, Pop-
Tarts. I'm gonna get them all
sugared up for school and turn
'em loose," says Pitt, who was
preparing breakfast for his children,
Maddox, Pax, Zahara, Shiloh,
Knox and Vivienne. "I've been up since 5. Now, I see
my six maniacs waking up, and I got to get them ready
for school and make breakfast. I tell you, it's going to
be pancakes for everyone this morning."
Over a sugary breakfast, the megastar will get
to soak in his multiple nominations: best actor and
best picture for Moneyball, along with best picture
for The Tree of Life.
What makes the recognition even more special,
though, is that Pitt produced both movies.
"I can't tell you the reward it is. Both films were
difficult to get made. Moneyball died two times and
had no lifeline, and we pulled it back," he says. "Tree of
Life, we thought we were dead and gone, and to see it
still have a dog in the hunt is great."
'I'm in good company' with idol Streep
Viola Davis, 46, actress, The Help
Being in the same category as
Meryl Streep, Michelle Williams,
Rooney Mara and Glenn Close
leaves Davis a little breathless.
"I'm in good company. Most of the
time, you're only as good as your
company. I've held Meryl Streep
in high regard. She's one of my
heroes. She inspired me to act,"
says Davis, who co-starred with
Streep in 2008's Doubt.
Davis earned her second career Oscar nomination
Tuesday. "It's a nice sense of accomplishment. I remember
being on my last unemployment check and
thinking, 'Something has to work in order for me to
eat.' Even walking onto that set in Mississippi and
thinking that this book has such a huge following and
there are so many high expectations. And now this.
It's amazing. God really does perform miracles."
'A huge thrill' shared with actress wife
Michel Hazanavicius, 44, director, The Artist
Director/writer Hazanavicius is
in Paris, and he's giddy.
"I really feel privileged and
lucky and happy because that's
something--this is the highest
recognition you can have. It's a
movie nobody wanted to finance
or produce. It's a huge thrill."
And he's sharing his nomination
with his wife, supporting-actress
nominee Bיrיnice Bejo, and pal
Jean Dujardin, an actor nominee. "To share that
wonderful, extraordinary adventure with my wife is
something incredible. It's awesome. But to share it
with Jean (and the crew)--we made that movie
as a group, and nobody was forgotten. In a personal
way, it's great."
But where was the nomination for Uggie, the
Jack Russell terrier who also stars in the film?
"The good thing is, I'm sure he doesn't care. He's
not like that. He's a good dog."
'An amazing surprise to wake up to'
Rooney Mara, 26, actress,
The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo
Mara was snoozing when her
name was announced. "My phone
started going crazy, and mymom
was there, and she came up. It
was very early, but it was an
amazing surprise to wake up to."
Indeed, the newcomer is up for
playing haunted hacker Lisbeth
Salander. "It's so amazing to have
my name on a list with these
other women. I feel very humbled
by it. I just feel honored."
No crazy night of bar-hopping to celebrate for her?
"I wouldn't even know how to do that."
'Enjoying the moment' -- with his dog
Kenneth Branagh, 51, supporting actor,
My Week With Marilyn
Don't call Branagh an Academy
Award nominee. "Pooper scooping
is my name on this Oscar
day," he says with a laugh, as he's
about to walk his dog in his
garden outside London. "You
caught me just as I was getting
my little blue bag ready. It's sort
of twilight here. I'm going to
enjoy the moment."
He found out that he was
nominated for his role as Laurence Olivier via a text
from the film's director, Simon Curtis.
As for the nomination: "It was immensely important
for me to do justice to Laurence Olivier. I would
have been haunted if I'd known that we hadn't done
right by him. At this end of things, this sense of just
being moved that enough people felt that we did a
good job for that great man is really deeply touching
and meaningful."
At his age, just 'cherish it'
Nick Nolte, 70, supporting actor, Warrior
Nolte's way of celebrating his
Oscar nomination ? "Go to sleep
early. At 70, naps are great," he
says. "I have a 4-year-old. I don't
know why, at 70, I have a 4-yearold.
It takes a lot of energy. No,
Sophie is such a blessing. She has
no idea what's going on. I love
trying to explain it to her."
He's enjoying every moment,
while also keeping things in
perspective. "It's probably the last nomination I'll get
at 70. I know better, to cherish it and just enjoy it as
much as possible without getting too desirous.
You can get caught up in all the hype. Warrior is
a really fine film, and this helps carry the torch
for it a little bit."
Acting 'like idiotic teenager' with Close
Janet McTeer, 50, supporting actress, Albert Nobbs
Wild laughter fills the background
when a "thrilled" McTeer
calls from New York with co-star
and fellow nominee Glenn Close.
That noise? "It's Glenn jumping
up and down in the background,
getting her makeup done,"
McTeer says. "We're calling
people and screeching and leaving
messages like two idiotic
teenagers."
The magic of McTeer and Close's on-screen dynamic?
"She's just so much shorter than me," McTeer
jokes. "She's literally under my armpit as we speak."
(Cue Close laughing.) "It's a combination of lots of
things. Glenn, like myself, is a perfectionist, and she
works incredibly hard, as do I, and she likes to laugh a
lot. And that combination is kind of heady and brilliant."
And then McTeer loses it, laughing hysterically.
"Now Glenn's standing on a stepladder so that I could
be under her armpit for a change."

2 men plead guilty in gun-smuggling case

BYLINE: John Bacon with staff and wire reports

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 600 words

Two men pleaded guilty Tuesday to buying guns that were destined to be smuggled into Mexico, the first convictions in the federal government's ill-fated Operation Fast and Furious.
The goal of the Justice Department investigation was to catch weapons-trafficking kingpins, but agents lost track of many weapons, and some ended up at crime scenes in Mexico and the U.S.
Jacob  Chambers and Jacob Montelongo admitted being part of a 20-person  ring  accused of running guns  for a drug cartel. Two rifles bought by the ring were found at the scene of a  2010 shootout near the Arizona-Mexico border that killed Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry. Congress is investigating the operation. 
Marine won't serve time for massacre
A military judge recommended no time in confinement for a Marine sergeant who pleaded guilty to negligent dereliction of duty in assaults by his squad that killed 24 unarmed Iraqis after a roadside bomb killed a Marine in 2005.
The judge's decision at Camp Pendleton, Calif., goes to the commander of the Marine Corps Forces Central Command for approval. Staff Sgt. Frank Wuterich of Meriden, Conn., entered the plea Monday. Seven other Marines were exonerated or had their cases dropped.
Final tapes released from Kennedy years
The last batch of recordings were released from a trove of tapes made in President John Kennedy's Oval Office, including an eerie conversation about what would become the day of his funeral.
Kennedy told staffers trying to arrange his Nov. 25, 1963, schedule that it was shaping up to be a "tough day."  "It's a hell of a day, Mr. President," a staffer agreed. Kennedy was shot Nov. 22. The exchange was among the last  recordings Kennedy made being released by the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum.
NYPD showed 'terrible judgment'
New York City police used "terrible judgment" in showing officers a film about Muslims that Islamic groups have complained is inflammatory, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said.
Bloomberg said commanders have stopped showing The Third Jihad, which depicts Hezbollah rocket attacks, children being held hostage by Muslim militants and a woman it says was arrested in Iran for wearing immodest clothing.
The film, played during counterterrorism training seminars, was bankrolled by the Clarion Fund, which describes itself as a "non-profit organization that produces and distributes documentaries on the threats of Radical Islam."
Garth Brooks gets $1M ruling from jury
An Oklahoma hospital in Garth Brooks' hometown must pay $1million to the country singer because it failed to build a women's health center in honor of his late mother, a jury decided.
Jurors ruled that the hospital must return a $500,000 donation  plus pay  $500,000 in punitive damages in Brooks'  lawsuit against IntegrisCanadian Valley Regional Hospital in Yukon. Brooks said he thought he'd reached a deal in 2005  but sued after  the hospital wanted to use the money for other construction projects. The hospital argued Brooks gave it unrestricted access to the money then  later asked for the women's center.
"Obviously we are disappointed," Integris spokesman Hardy Watkins said. "We're just glad to see the case come to a resolution."

KENNER, La. -- Two people in a vehicle died after it collided with a Chicago-to-New Orleans Amtrak train. No one on the train was injured.
WICHITA -- Judge Wesley Brown, the oldest sitting federal judge in history, has died at age 104, his clerk said. Brown, a semiretired or "senior" judge, withdrew from the draw for cases in March. Brown, asked in 2011 how how he planned to leave his post, quipped "Feet first."

Police get help with vets who are ticking bombs; 
Training geared to deal with violent ex-troops

BYLINE: Kevin Johnson, USA TODAY

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 2A

LENGTH: 527 words

The Justice Department is funding an unusual national training program to help  police deal with an increasing number of volatile confrontations involving highly trained and often heavily armed combat veterans. 
Developers of the pilot program, to be launched at 15 U.S. sites  this year, said there is an "urgent need" to de-escalate crises in which even  SWAT teams may be facing tactical disadvantages against mentally ill suspects who also happen to be trained in modern warfare.
"We just can't use the blazing-guns approach anymore when dealing with disturbed individuals who are highly trained in all kinds of tactical operations, including guerrilla warfare," said Dennis Cusick, executive director of the Upper Midwest Community Policing Institute. "That goes beyond the experience of SWAT teams."
Cusick, who is developing the program along with institute training director William Micklus, said local authorities have a better chance of defusing violent confrontations by immediately engaging suspects in  discussions about their military experience -- not with force.
The aim, Micklus said, is to try to reconnect them with "a sense of integrity" lost in the fog of emotional distress.
"You can't win by trying to out-combat them,'' Cusick said. "You emphasize what  it means to be a Marine, a soldier to people who now feel out of control."
There is no data that specifically tracks police confrontations with suspects currently or formerly associated with the military. But an Army report issued  this year found that violent felonies in the service were up 1% while non-violent felonies increased 11% between 2010 and 2011.
During that time, however, crime in much of the nation declined.
"What we're seeing is that the volume (of violent incidents involving military personnel off base) has ratcheted up to a level we have never seen before," Cusick said.
Much of the anecdotal evidence reads like the report of the Jan. 13 standoff between Army Staff Sgt. Joshua Eisenhauer, 30, a veteran of multiple combat tours, and Fayetteville, N.C., police and firefighters.
A 911 call from an  apartment complex manager revealed that Eisenhauer was allegedly barricaded inside one of the apartments exchanging gunfire with police.
Although the suspect was not specifically identified as a soldier, the apartment manager told a police dispatcher that the suspect was "under psychiatric care," according to the 911 call.
According to Fort Bragg records, Eisenhauer had been assigned to the post's Warrior Transition Battalion, a unit for soldiers who have been wounded or suffered other illnesses as a result of their deployment, Womack Army Medical Center spokeswoman Shannon Lynch said.
Eisenhauer, who was wounded in the standoff along with two police officers, is charged with 30 criminal counts, including 15 counts of attempted murder.
Darrel Stephens, executive director of the Major Cities (Police) Chiefs Association, said the type of training proposed by the Justice Department represents "one piece of the challenge'' in dealing with an increasing number of mentally ill suspects.
"This has been a challenge for a number of years in our communities," Stephens said.

Banks steps out on a 'Ledge'; 
'30 Rock' actress takes risks in 3 films, including 'Hunger Games'

BYLINE: Bryan Alexander USA TODAY

SECTION: LIFE; Pg. 1D

LENGTH: 1186 words

Elizabeth Banks eked out some rare down time from shooting scenes from her latest movie, Man on a Ledge.
Of course, this came as she and co-star Sam Worthington were sitting on a 14-inch ledge, 250 feet above the ground atop New York's Roosevelt Hotel, waiting for cameras to roll.
"The ledge was a few inches bigger than the size of a man's shoe," Banks says. "And then it was a straight sheer drop to the street, down 22 floors. You don't want to pull your BlackBerry out there. I focused on Sam and we hung out."
"It was just us and the pigeons," Worthington concurs. "When you're up there, you do get to enjoy the view." 
It was a rare moment of inactivity during one of the most jampacked  schedules in the business. Banks has three major films coming out in the next five months, starting with the crime thriller Man on a Ledge (out Friday) and the hugely anticipated adaptation of Suzanne Collins' novel The Hunger Games (March 23). She's also part of the all-star cast in the pregnancy comedy What to Expect When You're Expecting (May 11).
Adding to the intensity, Banks and husband Max Handelman are  parents to 7-month-old son Felix  and are co-producing the comedy Pitch Perfect, about a singing competition.
"It's a really exciting year, and it's essentially planned through August," says Banks, 37. "I just have to go one foot through the other day by day and get through it."
The first step is Ledge, in which Banks, in her first leading action role, plays a police negotiator trying to talk down a potential jumper.
The high emotions during the scene that has Banks joining Worthington on the ledge are authentic simply because the ledge itself was real.
"You can feel Elizabeth's fear when she's stepping out there," says producer Lorenzo di Bonaventua. "If you were on a set, you're not going to have that. There's a purity to that fear that you cannot escape."
Real-life daredevil
Such treacherous moments were hardly deterrents for Banks, who swings on trapezes for a hobby and says she is a roller coaster fanatic.
"My take on it is, life is worth living," she says. "It's much more dangerous getting in my car in Los Angeles than doing these stunts. However, there was a 2% chance of death the entire time."
Banks had a harness even for scenes shot inside the hotel room with an open window looking out to the ledge. And when the action moved outside, the security system was even more elaborate, to keep the stars from danger. Still, as Banks says, mistakes happen.
"I'm not afraid of heights, I'm afraid of human failure.  That scares me. I was constantly checking that everything was working.
"But," she says, "it was a pretty great rush."
Banks has had to get used to a fast-paced acting schedule since breaking out in 2008, playing Laura Bush in Oliver Stone's W as well as alongside Seth Rogen in Zack and Miri Make a Porno. Her widespread appeal has only increased with juicy characters such as 30 Rock's brash political commentator Avery Jessup, the Emmy-nominated role she has played during four seasons.
But her past workload hasn't required the  level of power days that she has now. During an interview at a sparse editing studio, Banks adroitly juggles planning for a trip to New York and Europe with her family to promote Ledge ("I need to find the right hotel for my son," she says), doing an interview and overseeing the editing of a webisode promoting Pitch Perfect.
"As producer, it's so important to shape the movie's message," she says. "Marketing is so important."
She's focused but isn't immune to laughing at the ad-libbed performances by the actors on-screen. The webisodes are due the next week, though, "so there's a little pressure," she adds with a tight smile.
The  release of The Hunger Games, which also stars Jennifer Lawrence, Liam Hemsworth and Josh Hutcherson, is more kindling for her career and hectic schedule, with Banks playing the pivotal role of Effie Trinket.
A villain to remember
In both the film adaptation and the best-selling book series, fan favorite Trinket is a wildly dressed representative from an authoritarian regime based in a futuristic center called the Capitol. Banks wanted to make sure her outrageous character had some depth.
"She's a great villain," Banks says. "But I wanted to make sure people didn't dismiss her as comic relief. I wanted to make a three-dimensional character."
Banks reveled in Effie's outrageous outfits, images of which already have been released. They were so intricate, right down to the flamboyant fake nails, that she couldn't do anything on her own on set without assistance -- something that further helped her transformation into the character.
"People had to do everything from dress me and take me to the bathroom and unzip. I literally couldn't even go to the bathroom," she says. "But that's totally Effie Trinket."
In her mind, the clothes represent the everyday strain of Capitol life. "She lives in an oppressive society, so everything she wears is tight and constricting. The shoes are torturous."
Though her casting has been accepted by the protective fans of the book series, there will always be detractors. ("There are some haters," Banks concedes. "But you can't please everyone.") The mania around the movie is poised to propel Banks into another stratum.
"We'll see," she says. "(The hype) is all online right now and all sort of fake. We won't know until people actually see it. But I'm also totally unrecognizable in this film."
She is on full display in What to Expect When You're Expecting, which boasts a cast including Jennifer Lopez, Cameron Diaz, Brooklyn Decker and Chris Rock.
Banks plays a know-it-all pregnancy author who finds out the real thing is far harder than theory as her body transforms.  For Banks, the  manifestation of that was a prosthetic stomach and a comically bulky bra.
"The stomach wasn't that bad, it was the boobs," Banks says with a laugh. "It's Pamela Anderson times 10. They just weighed so much and totally outpaced the stomach."
Her hormonal scenes, however,  set the stage for high comedy.
"It allowed me to be a little show-offy.  I feel I have, frankly, the funniest role in the movie."
Open-ended story line
It's the kind of out-there comedy fans have come to expect of Banks, whose anything-goes attitude gained a weekly audience thanks to her hilarious run as Jessup on 30 Rock. At the end of last season, Jessup was being held in North Korea as a slave-bride to leader Kim Jong Il's son. Now that the dictator has died in real life, Jessup is game to close the fictional loop.
"I know the writers want to address all of this, but I don't know how or when," she says. "No one has contacted me about specifics."
Banks has enough on her plate right now and will soon start looking ahead to new projects, including playing Tinker Bell in the live-action romantic-comedy film Tink. There will  be more flamboyant portrayals in store, as well.
As the Pitch Perfect editing session resumes, Banks looks up at the screen and sees herself in a webisode playing absurdly loud talk-show host Gail Abernathy.
"You might have noticed," she says with a smile. "I do love my outrageous characters."

Muslims urge NYPD commissioner to quit

BYLINE: John Bacon with staff and wire reports

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 586 words

Some Muslim leaders called Thursday for New York City's police commissioner to step down because of his appearance in a film they say puts their religion and its adherents in a bad light.
About 20 activists gathered outside City Hall and criticized Ray Kelly for giving an interview to producers of The Third Jihad. The movie uses dramatic footage to warn against the dangers of radical Islam and sharia, or Islamic law. Some Muslims say it encourages Americans to be suspicious of all Muslims. "Terrorism is an evil that must be eliminated, but one cannot fight wrong with wrong," said cleric Talib Abdur-Rashid. Mayor Michael Bloomberg said he stood by Kelly.
Mayor won't quit after 'taco' comment 
A Connecticut mayor's office was blasted with prank phone calls and a delivery of hundreds of tacos after his quip that he would address accusations of anti-Latino bias by eating tacos.
East Haven Mayor Joseph Maturo  has apologized several times but said he won't resign over remarks he made to a TV reporter following Tuesday's arrests of four town police officers, men described by one FBI official as "bullies with badges." Werner Oyandel, head  of Connecticut's Latino and Puerto Rican Affairs Commission, described the comment as "unprofessional and given in poor taste" and called for Marturo to resign.
Ex-Marine admits targeting Pentagon
An ex-Marine from Virginia pleaded guilty and agreed to serve 25 years on charges that he fired shots at the Pentagon, the Marine Corps museum in Quantico and other military targets in 2010.
Yonathan Melaku, 23, pleaded guilty to destruction of U.S. property, use of a firearm in an act of violence and intention to injure a veterans' memorial, namely Arlington National Cemetery. He was arrested this summer at the cemetery with two cans of spray paint and a notebook in Arabic that contained references to Osama bin Laden, the Taliban and the "path to jihad."
Gates pledges $750M to fight disease
Bill Gates pledged $750 million to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.
The Microsoft founder said the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation's donation comes on top of $650 million it contributed to the fund over the past decade. Gates said it was meant to encourage other potential donors. "These are tough economic times, but that is no excuse for cutting aid to the world's poorest," he said at a forum in Davos, Switzerland. The money perks up a struggling fund that last year had to cancel more than $1 billion in  spending. The fund's executive director, Michel Kazatchkine, resigned this week.
Navy sonar plan draws lawsuit
Conservationists and Native American tribes sued over the Navy's expanded use of sonar in  exercises off the West Coast, saying the noise can harass and kill whales and other marine life.
The environmental law firm Earthjustice, the Natural Resources Defense Council and other groups sued the National Marine Fisheries Service, saying it was wrong to approve the Navy's plan for the expanded training. The fisheries service and the Navy declined to comment.
Voter-discrimination probes set record
The Justice Department opened a record number of more than 100 investigations into possible voting rights discrimination last year, Attorney General Eric Holder said.
Holder, speaking at the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center in Cincinnati, praised  federal  enforcement efforts and vowed they will continue. Nowhere is the Justice Department's commitment to equal opportunity clearer than in efforts to expand access to voting, he said.

'The Grey': A drab story, but the wolves look great

BYLINE: Claudia Puig

SECTION: LIFE; Pg. 3D

LENGTH: 497 words

The computer-generated wolves have more personality than any of the dull characters in The Grey.
What starts as a tense and moody survival thriller fairly quickly becomes tedious, forced and far-fetched as a septet of men is preyed upon by a wolf pack in the Alaska wilderness. 
Wolves are much maligned in literature and films. The Grey takes the notion of their vicious natures to new extremes as dozens of hulking, bright-eyed beasts attack a ragtag assortment of plane-crash survivors with startling ferocity. When they're not ripping people to shreds -- as seen up close and personal through an annoyingly shaky camera -- they're lurking ominously nearby, howling and growling.
Liam Neeson stars as Ottway, a melancholy loner working among oil-rig roughnecks. Apparently, it's his job to keep the work site safe from animal attacks. When he's not shooting the furry denizens, he's obsessing over a letter he wrote to a woman he loved and lost. He spends a good portion of the movie rereading that letter. He has recurring dreams about his beloved lying in gauzy sheets, and he often recites the lines of a trite poem and consistently reaffirms his lack of religious faith.
Fresh moves are clearly not this guy's thing.
Subtlety is not a trait preferred by writer-director Joe Carnahan (The A Team), either. Early on, Neeson's Ottway sticks a shotgun in his mouth. Why he doesn't pull the trigger is left unexplained.
Next, he boards a small plane bound for Anchorage. Shortly after takeoff,  turbulence rocks the plane and it  crashes spectacularly in what looks like Arctic tundra. Bodies and plane parts  are mangled and scattered across the icy landscape. Ottway takes charge, rounding up the half-dozen survivors and calming a dying man.
This all seems  out of character for a guy who a few scenes earlier had seemingly lost the will to live. But he's still no match for the menacing wolves.
Suspense devolves into a rote tale of man vs. beast. The survivors don't fully capture our sympathies because no one is given much dimension. Verbal nastiness erupts occasionally between the humans, but most of their time is spent trudging through snowdrifts and getting into bloody tussles with wolves.
In a climactic scene, the wolf pack inexplicably stands patiently, waiting for Ottway to  get ready, arm himself and take a few moments to recite a snippet of a hackneyed poem before they attack. It's as if they were instructed on the gentlemanly art of battle.
In every other scene, the wolves come off as more brutal than bears, sharks and anacondas combined. With its reliance on jolts, sudden movements and thunderous sounds, The Grey is more startling than  frightening.

Isolated Tibetans further ostracized by violence; 
China's crackdown nears breaking point in 2 towns

BYLINE: Calum MacLeod, USA TODAY

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 6A

LENGTH: 797 words

Looking down on Drango town from his hillside monastery on China's eastern Tibetan plateau, monk Gelek Rabten appeared hopeful last fall. Unlike in neighboring counties, no Drango monks had set themselves on fire and died in protests for religious freedom.
Relations with the government are good, said Gelek, 41, a Tibetan who welcomed  rising numbers of Han Chinese, the nation's dominant ethnic group, now studying Tibetan Buddhism in Kardze, a rugged area  in Sichuan province. "We can share religion, we can share anything," he said. 
That dream of peace appears shattered after deadly clashes last  week between Tibetan protesters and  police in Drango, and in Serthar to the north. As families celebrated  lunar new year  with firecrackers and feasts, protesters gathered to mourn  16 self-immolations in the past year, say Tibet advocacy groups, including the U.S.-based International Campaign for Tibet (ICT).
Beijing blamed a "mob" of rioters for attacking police stations on  the first two days of the new year, according to the state-run Xinhua News Agency. One "rioter" died in both towns, Xinhua reported.
Officials have isolated the towns  as they crack down on the worst Tibetan unrest  since 2008.
On  Thursday, security forces killed one Tibetan and wounded several others in Ngaba prefecture, also in Sichuan, as a crowd tried to prevent the detention of a youth who had called for Tibetan freedom, ICT reported.
The escalating violence indicates that China's key ethnic problem  won't go away, however much firepower and funding the Chinese government dispatches to Tibetan areas.
Tibet's prime minister-in-exile, Lobsang Sangay, said Thursday that six people had reportedly died from police shootings; about 60 were injured. Sangay took over from the Dalai Lama last year as the political head of the government-in-exile in Dharamsala, India. The Dalai Lama, who fled Tibet in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule, remains the Tibetans' spiritual ruler.
The lockdown in Kardze means phone calls to Drango and Serthar  fail to connect as authorities have disabled telecommunications, in addition to bringing in truckloads of troops and setting up roadblocks on the long drive from the provincial capital Chengdu, exile groups have reported.
The Chinese government, which routinely blames the Dalai Lama for fomenting trouble, accused outsiders of exaggerating the  incidents.
"Overseas forces of 'Tibet independence' have always fabricated rumors and distorted the truth to discredit the Chinese government with issues involving Tibet," said foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei, Xinhua reported.
The blame for rising levels of dissent lies squarely with Beijing's hard-line policies, counter some academics and activists. As happened in Lhasa, the Tibetan capital, in the 1980s, last  week's protests show "the idea of confronting the Chinese state is moving from the clergy to the lay people," said Robbie Barnett, a Tibetan affairs expert at Columbia University in New York.
The Kardze region has long considered itself separate from Lhasa, let alone Beijing, but now "we're watching not just the spread of protests from the Lhasa areas to eastern areas, but also the perception of themselves as part of a single (Tibetan) nation, with a history separate from China," Barnett said. "China has created this surge of national feeling and history as a separate place."
Even under a crackdown ongoing since 2008, "people in Kardze have continued to risk their lives to express their views," Kate Saunders, an ICT spokeswoman, said. The self-immolations have caused widespread anguish but also a feeling of intense solidarity, she said.
"It's almost beyond protests and dissent, it's become a broadening of Tibetan identity.  Self-immolation is the ultimate self-sacrifice, but there are a whole range of other, more peaceful strategies" that Tibetans are employing, she said.
News of the unrest has been heavily restricted within China. On highly sensitive issues such as Tibet, Xinhua  prefers positive propaganda such as the recent announcement  that the Tibet regional government had distributed more than 1million Chinese flags and portraits of Communist leaders to Tibetan temples, schools and rural households.
But  the Tibetan Buddhist religion still dominates lives and landscapes. In the Kardze district last fall, portraits of the Dalai Lama could be seen in most holy places. Hillsides, roads and bridges were marked by giant prayer flags and prayer wheels turned by the faithful.
Sangay has called both for foreign intervention to end the crisis, and for dialogue with Beijing to resume. President Obama will have a chance to raise Tibetan issues with Beijing when Xi Jinping, likely to become China's leader by late 2012, visits the White House on Feb. 14.

L.A. teacher accused of abusing children

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 642 words

A Los Angeles elementary school teacher was arrested on child molestation charges after a film processor gave police photos showing blindfolded children with their mouths taped and cockroaches on their faces, authorities said Tuesday.
Sheriff's Lt. Carlos Marquez said it was determined that Mark Berndt, 61, gave some children semen on a spoon or cookie. The charges involve 23 boys and girls ages 6 to 10 from 2008 to 2010. Berndt, arrested Monday and being held in lieu of $2.3 million bail, worked for more than 30 years at Miramonte Elementary School.
Miramonte serves a poor, mainly Hispanic neighborhood, and more than half of its approximately 1,400 students are learning English, according to the school's website. 
Non-local jurors sought in Sandusky trial
Pennsylvania prosecutors, citing the "pervasive" news coverage of the child-sex-abuse case against former Penn State football assistant coach Jerry Sandusky, asked a judge to select jurors for Sandusky's trial from outside the area.
Senior Deputy Attorney General Joseph McGettigan did not ask to move the trial from Centre County.  Sandusky's lawyer, Joe Amendola, said he was vehemently opposed to using an out-of-county jury. Prosecutors indicated they will provide the identities of all 10 alleged victims to Sandusky's attorneys by week's end. No trial date has been set.--Kevin Johnson
Power failure draws nuke inspection
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission will investigate how some equipment responded to a power failure at an Illinois nuclear reactor.
NRC spokeswoman Viktoria Mitlyng said some water pumps at the Byron Generating Station switched off when the Unit 2 reactor lost power Monday, then came back on without being manually reset. She said the pumps are designed to switch off  but normally must be reset.
Exelon Energy  replaced a faulty electricity insulator  that was responsible for the outage.
Ind. Senate OKs teaching creationism
The Indiana Senate passed a bill  that would allow creationism to be taught in science classes in public schools. The bill, sponsored by Republican state Sen. Dennis Kruse, would allow schools to teach any religion-based views on the origin of creation -- be it Muslim, Jewish, Scientology or Christian -- alongside  evolution. Schools, however, would not be required to do so.
The bill, which passed 28-22, still would need to be approved by the House and signed by Gov. Mitch Daniels, a Republican, before it would became law.--Scott Elliott, The Indianapolis Star
Holder accused of dodging inquiry
The chairman of the House's chief investigative committee warned Attorney General Eric Holder that he could be held in contempt of Congress if he failed to provide more documents for the panel's inquiry into allegations that federal agents allowed hundreds of weapons to flow to Mexico and  drug cartel enforcers.
In a four-page letter, Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., charged that the Justice Department was trying to obstruct the panel's probe into Operation Fast and Furious. He said he wants documents  by Feb.9. The Justice Department said it has provided "numerous" officials,  witnesses and  thousands of pages of documents. Holder is to appear before Issa's panel Thursday to discuss the botched gun-trafficking investigation.--Kevin Johnson
Jesus gets OK to stay on mountaintop
A mountaintop Jesus can stay at a Montana ski resort for now, the U.S. Forest Service ruled.
The agency overturned its previous decision that  cited separation of church and state in determining  the statue would have to be removed from  federal land overlooking Whitefish. That decision drew  criticism from religious groups and Rep. Denny Rehberg, R-Mont. Forest Service supervisor Chip Weber said the revised decision took into account that the statue is eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. The Freedom from Religion Foundation plans to appeal.

Hezbollah's stance on Syria divides Arabs; 
Muted response to violence has some souring on uprising, future

BYLINE: Mona Alami

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 9A

LENGTH: 939 words

The dark shadows of Mount Lebanon run along the asphalt road as the car heads to the ancient city of Baalbeck, where the exquisitely carved ruins of Roman temples still stand.
The car slows in a traffic jam at one of the main intersections, not far from Roman columns that were once the entrance to the temple of Jupiter. Men from the drug squad, armed with machine guns and faces hidden by masks, search every car for caches of the marijuana, hashish and opium that have grown in this fertile valley for centuries.
Baalbeck is a city known for lawlessness. It is also known as a stronghold of Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite Muslim militant organization supported by Syria and Iran that has carried out terror attacks against U.S. targets and wars with Israel. 
Portrayed by its leaders as the protector of ordinary Muslims, that image is contradicted by its standing by mutely as its patron Syria kills fellow Muslims to preserve a dictatorship, critics say.
"Hezbollah has taken sides in the conflict," says Sheik Sobhi Toufayli, who headed Hezbollah in the 1990s.
When the Arab pro-democracy protests erupted last February in Egypt, Hezbollah applauded them. Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah said his organization  was in "solidarity with the Egyptian and Tunisian people and youth."
"This revolution is the product of the people's will and determination," he said. "We are witnessing a complete revolution of the poor, the free, the students."
Nasrallah also praised the Arab Spring democracy movements in Bahrain, Yemen and Libya. But he has no apparent enthusiasm for the uprising in Syria, where tens of thousands of Muslims are demanding democratic changes and the ouster of dictator Bashar Assad. Nasrallah even has overseen measures to help Assad crush the demonstrators.
"Hezbollah is in a difficult situation," says Talal Atrissi, professor of sociology at  Lebanese University. "The party supported other Arab revolutions because they shared their resistance ideology that inadvertently put an end to regimes known for their pro-American and Israeli sympathies. In Syria, however, the situation is different."
Syria for years has allowed weapons from Iran bound for Hezbollah in south Lebanon, on the border with Israel, to transit through its country. Thousands of missiles have made it to Hezbollah this way.
Hezbollah had taken advantage of the upheaval in Syria to obtain advanced weapons systems, such as long-range rockets and Russian-made air-defense systems, according to reports in The Jerusalem Post, quoting Western intelligence assessments.
Hezbollah's support for the Assad regime has not gone unnoticed by Syrian protesters. Recent images from demonstrations show people burning the yellow Hezbollah flag. The Syrian Revolution Coordination Committee has accused Hezbollah of firing Katyusha rockets from Lebanon into the al-Zabadani region of Syria where anti-Assad protests are taking place.
Hezbollah calls the accusations "false rumors," and Brahim Moussawi, editor of Hezbollah's magazine al-Intikad, declined to comment. But Shiites here appear to be divided over the matter.
Sitting in his vegetable store close to the opulent Beirut Central District, Mohamad Zaheridine reads a copy of the Quran while watching al-Manar TV, the Hezbollah-run station.
"People in Syria and Tunisia are just the same, fighting against tyrants. Syria's anti-Israeli policies do not make its crackdown on protesters legitimate," he says.
Electrician Abu Mazen agrees.
"The (Assad) regime does not have the right to quell the protest movement in blood," he says.
However, Ismail Zeaiter, a member of a powerful Bekaa clan, says his people "will sacrifice our blood and our souls for Bashar."
"Unrest in Syria is the result of a plot waged against the country and its ally Hezbollah (to put an end) to their fight against Israel," he says.
If the Syrian regime falls, it will be replaced by a Zionist ally, "and it will be the end for us all," Zeaiter says.
Layal Zein,  a saleswoman in a clothing store nearby, sees the uprisings as the work of the United States and Israel, a claim made often on al-Manar TV.
"Americans and Israelis want to repeat the Iraqi experience to sow regional discord," she says.
Others in the Shiite community are simply pessimistic about the outcome of the Syrian uprising.
"We have no faith that the protests (in Syria) will produce any real change. One dictator will take the place of the other," says Ahmad Dakroub, a Hezbollah supporter in Watwat, a  Beirut neighborhood.
Dakroub doubts that the downfall of Assad in Syria would  make a difference because of what happened in Lebanon when Hezbollah took charge of the government in June.
"Now that we (Hezbollah) are in power, nothing has changed. We still work day and night for a mere pittance. No matter who is in power, politics stays the same," he says.
SheikToufayli, however, warns that Hezbollah must avoid stirring up divisions between the Sunni Muslims leading the uprising in Syria, who are the majority, and the Shiite Muslim sect known as Alewite that dominates the government. Violence between Sunnis and Shiites has been tearing apart many Arab nations -- Iraq and Bahrain among them.
Lebanon itself went through a brutal civil war from the 1970s to the 1990s in which hundreds of thousands of Lebanese were killed or driven into exile. Toufayli says Hezbollah is drawing Lebanon into a conflict that could prompt a return of civil war here.
"I call on Hezbollah to reconsider its approach and unite Sunnis and Shiites. The solution resides in building a true democracy in Syria. Any other approach will only serve enemy interests," he says.

'Soul Train' laid the rails of a cultural revolution; 
And Don Cornelius was the hip trip's engineer

BYLINE: Marco R. della Cava and Steve Jones, USA TODAY

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 1A

LENGTH: 1512 words

Armed with sharp suits and a mesmerizing voice, Don Cornelius set out in 1970 to entertain viewers of Chicago's WCIU with a song-and-dance TV show called Soul Train. Turns out, America wanted in on the party.
Cornelius, 75, died Wednesday at his home in Sherman Oaks, Calif.,  from a self-inflicted gunshot wound,  the Los Angeles County coroner's office said. The music maverick struck financial and cultural gold with Soul Train, whose 35 years on the air made it the longest first-run syndicated show in history, with an effect  that crossed generations and races.
"Soul Train gave the black community reason to be proud," says Kenneth Gamble, half of the fabled songwriting team Gamble & Huff, who wrote the show's chugging theme song, known as T.S.O.P (The Sound of Philadelphia). "It was so rare at the time to see someone black doing anything like that."
If Dick Clark's American Bandstand was Saturday morning's placid place to play, Soul Train, with its driving music and innovative dancers rooted in the urban scene, was the coolest party you could hope to crash. Its minimalist stage played host to everyone from the Jackson 5 to Elton John. 
"That show was the centerpiece of my Saturdays," says hip-hop artist Terius "The-Dream" Nash, who co-wrote the Beyonce hit Single Ladies (Put A Ring on It) and performed on the program in 2005. "Don reminded me of my old band teacher. He could look you in the eye and you felt like he knew what you were going to be."
Soul Train "had a substantial impact and was very much a part of contemporary music history," says Clive Davis, chief creative officer of Sony Music Worldwide and the record mogul who nurtured the careers of Aretha Franklin, Whitney Houston and Dionne Warwick. "His show reached a sizable and devoted audience, and every major artist of the time did it and did it willingly."
The music industry mourns
News of Cornelius' death rippled through the entertainment industry and the blogosphere, where fans famous and anonymous alike were eager to pay tribute to a man whose signature sign-off -- "We wish you peace, love and soul!" -- became as familiar as family.
"Don Cornelius! It's so shocking and stunning," Aretha Franklin said in a statement. "A young, progressive brother set the pace and worldwide standard for young aspiring African-American men."
Earvin "Magic" Johnson, the basketball legend and chairman of Soul Train Holdings, recalled being glued to the television on Saturdays: "Soul Train taught the world to dance" and gave musicians and dancers "the ultimate platform to showcase their talents when no one else would."
When Arash Shirazi came to the USA from Iran, he watched Soul Train to learn English and wound up going into show business as a booking agent. He tweeted his condolences, adding that the show "opened the door to R&B dance culture.  It shaped my musical tastes and added a visual element to a song."
Actor Omar Epps thanked the man for "creating a platform which helped uplift me through my childhood," and rapper MC Hammer wrote: "It meant more to me to perform on #SoulTrain than to win a Grammy  Loved U So Much Don."
With his smooth, resonant baritone, Cornelius introduced hundreds of stars to the nation's multicultural TV audience, including James Brown, Jerry Butler, Marvin Gaye, The O'Jays and Barry White. In the background were a colorful menagerie of partiers who influenced dance and fashion and opened a window onto black culture that had received scant media exposure.
"Back then, there was no targeted television and I just had the sense that television shouldn't be that way," Cornelius told USA TODAY in a rare interview in 2010, when the show was celebrated with a VH1 documentary. "The primary mission of the show was to provide TV exposure for people who would not get it otherwise. People who didn't get invited to The Mike Douglas Show, or (Johnny) Carson. There was no ethnic television, just general-market television, which meant mostly white people."
Soul Train's role in pushing black culture into the mainstream cannot be underestimated, says Mark Anthony Neal, professor of black popular culture at Duke University.
"Motown had laid down the sonic groundwork, but Don Cornelius let you visualize it," he says. "Black power was visible on Soul Train. It's what led to the love affair between black and white culture, and why eventually you started seeing white musicians like Boz Scaggs on Don's show. That show filled a gap."
Cornelius developed his brainchild while working as a journalist and DJ in Chicago. Soul Train started as an after-school dance show on WCIU, supported by such local acts as Curtis Mayfield and The Chi-Lites. The show was sponsored by Johnson Products, makers of Afro Sheen, and with owner George Johnson's help, Cornelius moved production to Los Angeles for a weekly syndicated show that premiered in 1971. Stations skeptical of the unproven series were won over when Gladys Knight agreed to do the pilot. Other artists quickly jumped on board.
The program was rife with iconic elements. There was the Soul Train line, in which pairs of dancers popped creative dance moves and flashed outrageous jumpsuits and Afros on their way down. The Scramble Board gave two dancers 60 seconds to unscramble the name of a notable African-American entertainer or historical figure.
The dancers became stars in their own right and created moves such as locking, roboting and waacking (later known as voguing) that would be replicated at clubs and parties around the world. Singer Jody Watley and dance partner Jeffrey Daniels, who would become part of hit-making trio Shalamar, got their start on the show. (Daniels' "backslide" step is credited with influencing Michael Jackson's moonwalk.) So did Rosie Perez and Fred "Rerun" Berry (What's Happening!!).
"He was the host with the most," says Jermaine Hall, editor of Vibe magazine. "He was the representation of cool. He put across to the culture at large what was going on in the African-American community, much the way later on hip-hop would do the same."
The power of "seeing yourself on television can't be put into words, that wonderful reinforcing image of what it meant to be black," says Jeanne Sparrow, co-host of a morning TV show on WCIU, where she once worked with colleagues who had helped Cornelius launch his hit.
"I wasn't aware of that right away, because I was just a kid in Louisiana and all I cared about was the great fashions and learning the new dance moves," she says. "But there was clearly a lot more going on there. Today, I still say goodbye to some friends with, 'Love, peace and soul.'"
Troubled times in later years
Cornelius would conduct his Soul Train until 1993, which stayed on the tracks another 13 years with assorted hosts. By the time he sold it to MadVision Entertainment in 2008, he had created an empire that included the Soul Train Music Awards and  Lady of Soul Awards.
But privately, life wasn't always a party for Cornelius. In recent years, he was beset by health and legal problems. He was arrested in October 2008 at his Los Angeles home on felony domestic abuse charges. Two months later, he pleaded not guilty to spousal abuse against his estranged wife, Russian model Victoria Avila-Cornelius. He changed his plea to no contest in March 2009 and was placed on 36 months' probation.
During 2009 divorce proceedings in Los Angeles County Superior Court, Cornelius stated in court documents: "I have significant health issues. I want to finalize this divorce before I die." He had  had a stroke and undergone brain surgery.
So far, no reason for Cornelius' apparent suicide has been offered. And those who knew him say there were no signs  he was depressed in the days before his death.
"He was not a despondent guy," says Kenard Gibbs, CEO of Soul Train Holdings, who had been in contact with Cornelius in efforts to revive the brand. ("We've been in talks about bringing Soul Train back to TV," he says.)
Another close friend and associate also says there was "no indication this was going to happen."
"Just last week, he and I spoke about dropping in on a friend's new restaurant outside of L.A.," says Darryl Porter, co-founder of PorterGeller Entertainment, which had been working with Cornelius to translate the story of Soul Train into a feature film. "He didn't seem like a guy who wasn't planning on a future."
Porter says he and Cornelius met  with studios about a film, but nothing stuck. (Warner Bros. confirms the project is no longer in play at that studio.) Porter says scripts and titles came and went as Cornelius struggled with what tale he wanted to tell.
"There's a story worth telling about how Don changed the culture for black Americans," says Porter, who adds he knew Cornelius for 26 years and was treated like a son. "He influenced dance and fashion, taking regional fads and making them national trends. He helped put black products on TV. And he was so charismatic and funny.
"Soul Train for us was like church on Saturday," Porter sighs. "It's a sad ending to a phenomenal life."

Cooking up a Super Bowl ad?; 
Stars aren't cheap, though, and their spots aren't always all that effective

BYLINE: Bruce Horovitz, USA TODAY

SECTION: MONEY; Pg. 1B

LENGTH: 1621 words

During commercial breaks on Sunday, the Super Bowl may look a lot more like the Celebrity Bowl.
Make that the celebrity mixing bowl.
Just shake in a little David Beckham -- in his underwear -- and stir. (That's what H&M is doing.) Sprinkle in some Victoria's Secret model Adriana Lima showing up in not one, but two Super Bowl spots. (Kia and Teleflora.) Mix in a middle-aged Matthew Broderick, who reprises his famous Ferris Bueller character. (Honda.) Add Jerry Seinfeld and Jay Leno, knocking heads for a collectible car. (Acura.) And add a dash of rock icon Elton John, who stars with 19-year-old X Factor winner Melanie Amaro. (Pepsi.)
Super Bowl advertisers are latching onto celebrities this year like star-struck teens. More than one-third of the game's 50-some spots will feature a familiar celeb or two -- or three. At $3.5 million for each 30 seconds of airtime, advertisers seem hell-bent on attracting attention this year at any cost. Even, in several cases, if it means glomming onto a celeb with zippo to do with the brand. 
Some are trying to latch onto the stars' social-media following. Some are seeking instant credibility. And some think it's the only way to stand out from the pack of Super Bowl marketers trying do just about anything to get noticed by the 100 million-plus TV viewers -- plus untold millions of social-media fans to follow.
It ain't cheap. Advertisers have spent  $1.72 billion over the past 10 years just for Super Bowl airtime, estimates Kantra Media. Add to that the multimillion-dollar budgets for some of the more extravagant ads, and then they'll also be paying celebs anywhere from $50,000 to $1.5 million to star in their game day spots.
"Every advertiser is looking for insurance," says Noreen Jenney Laffey, founder of Celebrity Endorsement Network, which links celebs with marketers. "And every celebrity wants to be in a Super Bowl spot. Even for celebrities, it's a big deal."
There's just one problem: Ads with celebrities are 3% less effective than ads without them, reports AceMetrix, a research firm that specializes in measuring ad effectiveness. And during the Super Bowl, they tend to do far worse. During last year's Super Bowl, AceMetrix says, ads without celebrities performed 9.2% better than those with celebrities. And ads with animals performed 21% better than ads with celebrities.
"Dogs do better than celebrities," says Peter Daboll, CEO at AceMetrix, which had online panels of 500 consumers review every Super Bowl spot from 2011.
"It's hard to find a celebrity who isn't polarizing," explains Daboll. As a result, a chunk of viewers are immediately turned off. "You can't find a celebrity who doesn't offend anyone -- unless it's Betty White."
White, of course, starred in a top-performing Snickers spot two years ago that also was a career boost for her. That's why even celebs who decline other offers historically have been eager to do Super Bowl spots.
It's why then-superstars Cindy Crawford and Michael J. Fox starred for Pepsi in the 1980s and 1990s. And before that, it's why a young but wildly popular Joe Namath starred for Noxzema back in 1973.
"I had no idea at the time what the Super Bowl itself would become, let alone the ads," says Namath. But as a red-hot, brash-talking celeb, he was thrilled to be paired with then-unknown model Farrah Fawcett. He says he wanted to ask her out but was in a relationship at the time. "Some ads may be a blur," he says, "but that one I can still see clearly."
All about the buzz
It isn't just the glitz and the easy money that celebs like about Super Bowl ads. They crave the buzz.
"The Super Bowl is the one time of year when people watch commercials on purpose," says Danica Patrick, the race car driver who will star in two racy Go Daddy ads on Sunday, bringing her total over the years to 10. She has starred in more Super Bowl spots than any other celebrity. All the broadcast, print and social-media hoopla before, during and after the game "is a big win for me," she says.
Unless an ad really bombs, it's a big win for any celebrity.
"It allows them to be part of one big entertainment extravaganza," says David Schwab, vice president at Octagon, which links brands with celebs. Super Bowl spots also allow a celebrity to be extra cool via a kind of self-deprecation they don't typically get to show otherwise, Schwab says. "The real pay is that it can stoke their image."
That's one reason why famed comedians  Seinfeld and  Leno show up together in a spot in which the two real-life car collectors lust after the same Acura sports car. And why  Broderick shows up as a middle-aged version of his teen character from Ferris Bueller's Day Off, playing hooky from work this time for sister brand Honda.
For the carmakers, using celebs is all about attracting eyeballs. "We had a difficult year (in 2011) due to the natural disaster in Asia," says Michael Accavitti, vice president of marketing at American Honda. "We needed a spark to set this year off to a good start."
A-list vs. B-list celebs
Budget constraints, even at this lofty level, have many Super Bowl advertisers turning to B-list celebs in 2012.
"The tipping point is the cost," says Octagon's Schwab. Advertisers, even in the Super Bowl, are under extreme pressure to limit costs. "Why spend for an A-lister if you can get about the same attention with a B?" he asks.
Dannon, for example, has former Full House star John Stamos pitching its Greek yogurt. Century 21 bundles Donald Trump, speed skater Apolo Ohno and former football great Deion Sanders -- who also stars in a Bridgestone spot. Bridgestone, meanwhile, also is using former Super Bowl quarterback Troy Aikman and basketball stars Steven Nash and Tim Duncan. Then, there's TV host Regis Philbin's cameo in a Pepsi Max spot. And Arrested Development's Will Arnett, now on Up All Night, hyping video service Hulu.
Some advertisers, such as Kia, are using multiple B-list celebrities in their ads, hoping that at least one of them catches the public's social-media fancy. Try, for one moment, to imagine Lima, the sexy model; ultimate fighting champ Chuck Liddell; and 1980s heavy metal band Mtley Cre in a single spot. Kia has not only imagined it, it's done it.
"It's all about getting people to talk about the spot and talk about the brand," says Michael Sprague, vice president of marketing and communications at Kia.
It's also about getting the celebs to tweet about the ads and yak about them on their Facebook pages. Lima, for example, has more than 1 million Facebook followers. Never mind that she'll also be appearing in a Teleflora spot. "If she can help me tap into several million people before game day, I consider it a success," Sprague says.
But Kia doesn't have the Super Bowl ad budget to pay for A-list celebs, Sprague says. "We were looking at some of those, and their asking prices were outrageous," he says.
Some are willing to pay. Last year, Best Buy snatched one of the ultimate A-listers, Justin Bieber, for it's Super Bowl spot. "We went in with all guns blazing," says Andreas "Drew" Panayiotou, senior vice president of U.S. marketing. And it earned the retail chain more than 25 million Web views within just a few days after the Super Bowl -- and 1.3 billion consumer media impressions.
This year, it was preparing to do much the same. It had scripts in the works for ads that might have featured actor George Clooney or Comedy Central's Stephen Colbert, Panayiotou says.
Then, Steve Jobs died and that changed Best Buy's thinking.
"When Jobs passed away, it reinforced for us the fact that there's a different kind of celebrity these days," Panayiotou says. "We thought it was time to revisit the term 'celebrity' and what it means. Folks in technology are today's real celebrities, but people don't know who most of them are."
So Best Buy, which views itself as a tech retailer, rounded up a dozen tech "unknowns" -- entrepreneurs whose tech accomplishments might be familiar to viewers but whose names are not. It's going to include snippets of a handful of them in its Super Bowl spot. Among them: the guy who developed one of the first camera phones.
Skechers also has made an unexpected U-turn with celebs.
Last year, its Super Bowl ad starred the very high-profile Kim Kardashian wearing very little in a racy workout with her personal trainer. This year its ad features a French bulldog, albeit with a cameo by billionaire Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban.
Unlike Kardashian, however, Cuban says he's a real bargain. "They're not paying me anything," he says. He's only in the spot, he insists, because he's a tech buff and he likes the technology in the new Skechers GOrun shoes.
A dream come true
Pepsi says its use of celebrities in Super Bowl ads continues to evolve because social media has put a twist on consumer relationships with stars. "If we put Lady Gaga in a Super Bowl spot just for the sake of having a big name, I don't think we'd connect with consumers," says Angelique Krembs, vice president of marketing for Pepsi. "We recognize that celebrities have a different relationship with consumers than they did 10 years ago."
Pepsi's big spot features Amaro singing a contemporary version of Aretha Franklin's Respect for 17 seconds. The teenager says that just being in the Pepsi ad is a childhood dream come true. The winner of TV singing competition X Factor, with which Pepsi had a season-long, big-budget promotional tie, will sing for, as well as appear with, John in the ad.
Amaro says that when she was very young, she'd watch the Super Bowl with her dad -- and dream.
He'd be watching the game, she says, while she'd be watching for Pepsi's music-filled spots. She recalls thinking every year, "I can do a commercial like this."
This Sunday, she will.

Drought is declared over in Dallas area

BYLINE: John Bacon with staff and wire reports

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 605 words

One of the most severe droughts in Texas history has ended for millions of Dallas-area residents, officials said Thursday.
The U.S. Drought Monitor, in its weekly map posted online, classified the Dallas-Fort Worth area as officially out of drought for the first time since July. Water restrictions for more than 6 million people in the fourth-most populous U.S. metro area will be lifted if the trend continues.
Texas is experiencing the most severe single year of drought in its history, and nearly 60% of the state remains in severe or exceptional stages of drought. "It's still a very tenuous situation," National Weather Service meteorologist Victor Murphy said. "If we have a dry spring and a hot summer, it will be very perilous." 
L.A. teacher had been accused before
Los Angeles sheriff's deputies recommended in 1994 that a sex charge  be filed against a teacher now suspected of taking bondage-style photos of students, but prosecutors said there wasn't enough evidence, authorities said.
A female student had claimed elementary schoolteacher Mark Berndt reached toward her genitals during class, but she pushed his hand away, sheriff's Sgt. Dan Scott said. Miramonte Elementary School notified the sheriff's department, which investigated. Berndt, 61, jailed on $23 million bail, is accused of committing lewd acts on 23 boys and girls, ages 6 to 10, from 2005 to 2010.
No-fly list doubles to 21,000 names
The Obama administration has more than doubled, to about 21,000 names, its secret list of suspected terrorists who are banned from flying to or within the U.S., including about 500 Americans, government figures show.
Federal, state and local law enforcement officials "continue to identify people who want to cause us harm, particularly in the U.S. and particularly as it relates to aviation," Transportation Security Administration chief  John Pistole.
Illegal fungicide found in orange juice
The Food and Drug Administration said it has found low levels of an illegal fungicide in orange juice samples taken from Florida manufacturers.
The FDA says the fungicide carbendazim is far below dangerous levels, and that the juice is safe and won't be recalled. The juice was mixed with product from Brazil, where the fungicide is used. It is not approved for oranges in the USA.
TSA agent accused of theft at JFK
A Transportation Security Administration agent stole $5,000 from a jacket at New York's John F. Kennedy  Airport, authorities said.
Alexandra Schmid, 31, took the cash from a Bangladeshi passenger's jacket pocket as it went along an X-ray conveyor belt Wednesday, said Al Della Fave, spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey's police force. Surveillance video showed Schmid taking the money, wrapping the cash in a plastic glove and taking it to a bathroom, Della Fave said. The money hasn't been recovered. Schmid, facing a grand larceny charge, was suspended pending an investigation.
Fort Hood shooting trial delayed
The Army psychiatrist accused of killing 13 people during a rampage at Fort Hood in Texas will go on trial June 12 instead of next month, a military judge ruled. Lt. Col. Kris Poppe, the lead defense lawyer for Maj. Nidal Hasan, argued during a hearing at the Army post in Texas that he still lacked key evidence needed for trial.
Hasan is charged with 13 counts of premeditated murder and 32 counts of attempted premeditated murder for the November 2009 attack.

SALT LAKE CITY -- Police  won't be sanctioned for using pepper spray and batons on Polynesians performing a  war dance at a high school football game. Uintah County Attorney G. Mark Thomas called it a  misunderstanding.

2 dead, 400 hurt in Egyptian protests after soccer riot

BYLINE: The Associated Press

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 6A

LENGTH: 285 words

Anger over a deadly soccer riot erupted in fresh clashes that injured nearly 400 people Thursday as security forces fired tear gas at fans and other protesters who accused police of failing to stop the bloodshed. 
Police shot and killed two protesters in Suez, Egypt, early today, health official Mohammed Lasheen said, the first to die in clashes after the soccer riot.
A network of soccer fans known as Ultras vowed vengeance, accusing the police of intentionally letting rivals attack them after Wednesday's Egyptian league match in the seaside city of Port Said because they have been at the forefront of protests over the past year, first against Hosni Mubarak and now against the military that assumed power after Mubarak's Feb. 11 ouster.
The 74 deaths Wednesday were  from the world's worst soccer violence in 15 years.
The riot in Port Said began when local Al-Masry fans stormed the field after a rare 3-1 win against Cairo-based Al-Ahly, one of Egypt's most popular clubs, and began attacking their rivals, forcing hundreds into a narrow stadium exit, only to be crushed against a locked gate.
Tensions spread to Cairo as many of the dead were brought home for burial and the wounded joined the protests.
What began Thursday as a peaceful march from the Al-Ahly headquarters in Cairo descended into fury as more than 10,000 demonstrators reached the area outside the Interior Ministry.
Chants calling for the execution of the country's military rulers, led by Mubarak's defense minister of two decades Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi, rang through the area.
"We dreamed of change. They fooled us and brought us a field marshal instead," the protesters chanted. Some appealed to the army to side with the people.

Holder accuses Republicans of 'character assassination'

BYLINE: Kevin Johnson, USA TODAY

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 8A

LENGTH: 378 words

Attorney General Eric Holder lashed out at Republican members of a House panel investigating a botched federal gun-trafficking inquiry that allowed hundreds of firearms to flow to Mexico. He challenged a New York congresswoman who asked how many more federal agents would have to die before the attorney general took responsibility for the case. 
Two weapons traced to the gun operation, known as "Fast and Furious," were recovered at the scene of the murder of Border Patrol agent Brian Terry in 2010.
The weapon used in Terry's death has not been identified, but the shooting brought an end to the gun-trafficking operation in which agents allowed guns purchased in the USA to be passed to drug cartel enforcers in Mexico in hopes of building cases against cartel leaders.
"As a member of Congress  is that the way you want to be seen?" Holder told Rep. Ann Marie Buerkle, adding that the question was "beneath a member of Congress."
The hearing, marking the sixth time Holder has been questioned by Congress about the flawed gun operation, was contentious from the start. Rep. Tim Walberg, R-Mich., compared the actions of a separate Justice official in the case to the response of now-deceased former Penn State University football coach Joe Paterno to sex-abuse allegations against former assistant coach Jerry Sandusky.
In that case, Paterno passed the information to his superiors but was publicly criticized for not reporting the alleged activity to police.
Holder, clearly irritated, described some of the Republicans' comments as akin to "character assassination."
Holder has said he did not authorize the gun operation and did not learn of the controversial tactics until more than a month after Terry's death.
"I am the attorney general of the United States, OK," Holder said before launching into a defense of his actions in the gun inquiry and his management of the Justice Department.
Earlier, committee Chairman Darrell Issa, R-Calif., openly threatened Holder with a contempt citation if the Justice Department did not provide the panel with additional documents for its inquiry.
Holder said Justice has turned over more than 6,000 documents related to the case.
He disavowed some of the tactics used in the gun investigation as "misguided" and "wholly unacceptable."

Missing woman's kids, husband killed

BYLINE: From staff and wire reports

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 609 words

A fast-moving fire that was intentionally set  at a Washington state home Sunday killed Josh Powell, the husband of a missing Utah woman, and their two young sons, officials said.
The blaze  occurred moments after a Child Protective Services worker delivered the two boys to the home for a supervised visit, Graham Fire and Rescue Chief Gary Franz said. Powell let the boys in, then blocked the door. The social worker called her supervisors to report that she could smell gas, then the home burst into flames.
Powell's lawyer, Jeffrey Bassett, said he received an e-mail from his client sent moments earlier. It said, "I'm sorry. Goodbye." 
Sgt. Ed Troyer, the Pierce County sheriff's spokesman, said it appeared something  was used to make the house burn faster.
The children had been living with their mother's parents since Josh Powell's father, Steven, was arrested on child porn and voyeurism charges.  On Wednesday, a judge denied an attempt by Josh Powell to regain custody. Josh Powell was under investigation in the disappearance of his  wife, Susan, 28,  in  2009.
Eight sailors discharged for hazing
Eight sailors have been discharged from the Navy after a hazing incident that was captured on video. They received general discharges following allegations they assaulted and choked the sailor aboard the USS Bonhomme Richard as part of a rite to initiate the sailor into a new department, Lt. Cmdr.  David McKinney said. "He was choked out, evidently blacked out, and had bruising," McKinney said.
The action follows congressional hearings on hazing in the military, including the case of Lance Cpl. Harry Lew, who shot himself in a foxhole in Afghanistan after he was beaten, forced to do repeated pushups and fed mouthfuls of sand.
Murder trial of lacrosse player begins
Jury selection gets underway today  in Charlottesville, Va., in the trial of a former University of Virginia lacrosse player accused of killing his ex-girlfriend, a member of the women's team.
George Huguely V is charged with  murder in the May 3, 2010, death of Yeardley Love, 22.
Huguely, 24, told police he kicked in Love's bedroom door and shook her, causing her head to hit a wall several times. His lawyers have said she died accidentally from an irregular heartbeat.
Since Love's death, the university tightened a requirement that students disclose any arrests. Huguely never told the university that he was arrested for public drunkenness and resisting arrest in 2008. The school has promoted awareness of domestic violence and held workshops on abusive relationships. Virginia has changed its law to allow people in dating relationships to file for protective orders.
Family found in forest after six nights
Three mushroom pickers who were lost six nights in a  forest of southwest Oregon without food considered eating their dog, and used the screen on their dead cellphone and the blade of a sheath knife to flash a signal at the helicopter pilot who found them, one of them said Sunday.
Dan Conne said  from his hospital bed  that he,  his wife and son spent the nights huddled in a hollow log with nothing to eat, and considered sacrificing their pit bull, Jesse, for food.
A volunteer helicopter pilot looking outside the search area Saturday spotted Dan and Belinda Conne, both 47, along with their son  Michael, 25, on the edge of a deep ravine in tall timber.

'Vow' stirs fond memories for its stars; 
McAdams and Tatum shared lots of laughs on the set

BYLINE: Andrea Mandell, USA TODAY

SECTION: LIFE; Pg. 4D

LENGTH: 662 words

It's not quite Valentine's Day, but Rachel McAdams and Channing Tatum are getting hot and heavy in a corner booth at the Four Seasons hotel.
Well, not quite.
McAdams, petite in a  pair of high-waisted shorts and a scoop-necked Valentino top, is squished into a ball as a suited-up Tatum purrs into her ear: "If I was a puppy. And you bought me. I would jump. All. Over. You."
McAdams can't take it any more. "OK, OK!" she says, laughing. "So it doesn't translate." McAdams had just finished recapping her friend's 4-year-old daughter's first crush. "She was on a safari and she fell in love with her park ranger," McAdams says. "And she turned to him and said, 'If I was a puppy and you bought me, I would jump all over you.' Is that the cutest, sweetest thing you've ever heard?" 
Tatum obviously disagrees, but "there's no line on the face of the planet that does actually work," says the actor, who has been married to actress Jenna Dewan since 2009. "Come up, say 'Hello, my name is Channing. What's your name? What are you doing here? You want something to drink? Nice -- what is that a necklace? Oh, you like vintage things?' Have a conversation!"
A tragic love story
The art of wooing is on display  in their  movie, The Vow, but heart-wrenchingly so. McAdams plays Paige, a Chicago sculptor who loses five years of her memory after she and her musician husband, Leo (Tatum), are  in a  car crash. When Paige awakens, she reverts to the self she remembers, attending law school and clinging to a successful, straitlaced ex-boyfriend (Scott Speedman). Leo, now a stranger, tries desperately to win her back.
McAdams consulted with a neurosurgeon in preparing to play the confused Paige. "It was interesting finding out that people who have brain trauma, and the tape is erased and they're not necessarily going to get those memories back, they will still find their way back kind of unconsciously (to) where they left off before the accident," says McAdams, who also met with the woman who inspired the story.
It's hardly this pair's first time in tearjerker territory. Both have appeared in movies based on novels by Nicholas Sparks: McAdams in 2004's The Notebook and Tatum in 2010's Dear John. With big projects on the horizon -- McAdams, 33,  stars in Terrence Malick's next untitled film, and Tatum, 31,  stars in 21 Jump Street, this summer's GI Joe sequel and male-stripper-focused flick Magic Mike -- both say the unlikely story drew them in.
"I want to be able to even get better than (Dear John)," Tatum says, adding that until McAdams agreed to sign on, he was unsure. But, "then she found it and I came running to it."
Director Michael Sucsy (HBO's Grey Gardens) recalls Tatum winning McAdams over immediately on the set.
"I instinctively felt they would have chemistry," Sucsy says. "During rehearsals I checked in with her and said, 'So, what do you think?' And she goes, 'He's really charming.'"
Romantic sides revealed
In person, the two actors are playful, with McAdams teasing Tatum about the beefcake promotional shots recently released for Magic Mike. "The bow ties on the beach," she grins, brow arched. "Take us through that."
In turn, Tatum helpfully recounts the pranks he pulled on The Vow's set, from the prop  he shocked McAdams with during a nude scene "to get a good reaction out of her," he winks, to stealing her car after a late night of shooting.
"He's the sweetest thing in the world until it comes to pranks, and then he's terrifying," McAdams says.
But ask about love, and moments that have meant most to them, and they become more introspective.
"I think my wife saying yes to being married," Tatum says.
McAdams reveals she's a romantic.
"I love finding the perfect gift for someone or doing things that show that you really know that person," says McAdams, who has been dating actor Michael Sheen since the two worked on the Oscar-nominated film Midnight in Paris.
"There's nothing better than being known by someone, and knowing someone else so well."

Local officials seek help with extremists

BYLINE: John Bacon with staff and wire reports

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 592 words

The FBI said Monday that it is being inundated with calls from local government officials asking for assistance in dealing with anti-government extremists, officials said.
Stuart McArthur, deputy assistant director of the FBI's Counterterrorism Division, said the extremists -- part of the "sovereign citizen" movement that advocates a rejection of government authority, taxes and laws -- have the potential to prompt violence in their day-to-day encounters with police, judges, inspectors and other local government officials.
McArthur said the movement, which first rose to prominence in the 1990s when anti-government fervor produced Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, has shown signs of escalating criminal activity. "Our focus has been increasing," McArthur said.--Kevin Johnson 
GPS taking over skies from radar
A bill to speed the nation's switch from radar to an air-traffic-control system based on GPS technology received final congressional approval.
The bill authorizes $63.4 billion for the Federal Aviation Administration over four years, including about $11 billion toward the air-traffic system and its modernization. It accelerates the modernization program by setting a deadline of June 2015 for the FAA to develop new arrival procedures at the nation's 35 busiest airports so planes can land using the more precise GPS navigation.
Texas abortion law gains momentum
A federal judge said  he won't attempt to block a Texas law requiring women to have a sonogram at least 24 hours before having an abortion.
Judge Sam Sparks previously ruled parts of the law unconstitutional, but a federal appeals court overturned his decision last month. The New York-based Center for Reproductive Rights said it will continue efforts to block the law requiring physicians to show women images of their sonograms, to play fetal heartbeats aloud and describe features of a fetus.
Sons killed in fire had 'chop injuries'
The sons of a missing Utah woman suffered severe chopping injuries to their heads or necks as they died in a house fire set by their father, authorities in Washington state said.
Smoke inhalation was the primary cause of death for Josh Powell and his two young sons, the Pierce County Medical Examiner's Office said. The boys also suffered "chop injuries" that contributed to their deaths. Sheriff's Detective Ed Troyer said a hatchet was found near their bodies.
No trial yet for accused Giffords shooter
The suspect in the Tucson-area shooting rampage that wounded former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords will spend four more months at a federal prison facility where officials are forcibly medicating him, a federal judge ruled.
Judge Larry Burns said Jared  Loughner has made marked improvement in group therapy  at the facility in Springfield, Mo. Mental health experts  determined  Loughner, 23, suffers from schizophrenia and are trying to make him competent to stand trial. He  pleaded not guilty to 49 charges stemming from the Jan. 8, 2011, attack.
Another Occupy tent city coming down
A tent city in Maine that is among the longest-lived of the Occupy movement was being dismantled as part of a new round of evictions.
Protesters removed several communal tents  in Portland, and the city extended Monday's eviction deadline to let them remove 16 remaining tents. Occupy Maine said it plans to continue the discussion about corporate excesses and economic inequality.
Also, a judge on Monday issued a final eviction notice for Occupy Pittsburgh. Over the past week, police began breaking up encampments in Miami, Austin and Washington, D.C.

FAA directed to make (air)space for drones; 
Potential market is enormous, but commercial pilots raise concerns about air safety

BYLINE: Bart Jansen, USA TODAY

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 770 words

Within a few years, that flying object overhead might not be a bird or a plane, but an unmanned aircraft.
Drones, perhaps best known for their combat missions in Afghanistan, are increasingly looking to share room in U.S. skies with passenger planes. And that's prompting safety concerns.
Right now, remote-controlled drones are used in the U.S. mostly by the military and Customs and Border Patrol in restricted airspace. 
Now, organizations from police forces searching for missing persons to academic researchers counting seals on the polar ice cap is eager to launch drones weighing a few pounds to some the size of a jetliner in the same airspace as passenger planes.
On Monday, the Senate sent to President Obama legislation that would require the Federal Aviation Administration to devise ways for that to happen safely in three years.
"It's about coming up with a plan where everybody can get along," says Doug Marshall, a New Mexico State University professor helping develop regulations and standards. "Nobody wants to get hurt. Nobody wants to cause an accident."
The drones' appeal is they can fly anywhere it's too dangerous or remote for people, and they cost less than piloted helicopters or planes.
In Mesa County, Colo., for example, sheriff's deputies have negotiated a special agreement with the FAA to fly a 2-pound helicopter  up to 400 feet above ground so a camera can snap pictures of crime scenes or accidents. An infrared camera helps deputies track a missing person or a suspect in an overgrown ravine.
"It's a tool in the toolbox," says Ben Miller, the program's manager.
'Huge potential market'
One reason advocates expect police to adopt drones is they're less expensive than manned helicopters. A Draganflyer X6 drone  such as the one Mesa uses  costs about $36,000.  Another squad car, for instance, costs about $50,000, Miller says.
"There is a huge potential market for civilian and commercial uses of unmanned aircraft systems," says Ben Gielow, general counsel for the industry group Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International.
The market will almost double over the next decade  to $11.3 billion, according to a March  estimate by the Teal Group in Fairfax, Va., which analyzes the aerospace and defense industries.
Commercial pilots have raised safety concerns. Although pilots are required to spend time flying planes and are tested on their abilities to hold licenses, no similar rules exist for the controllers of remote aircraft. Likewise, the FAA doesn't certify drones like passenger planes against engine failure or wings falling off.
Capt. Lee Moak, president of the Air Line Pilots Association, says the people who remotely control aircraft should meet the same training and qualifications as regular pilots. His group is also concerned about controllers losing contact with drones.
"We have a long way to go," Moak says of having drones fly safely with passenger jets.
Despite their many successful flights in Afghanistan, drones occasionally crash.
In August, for instance, an unmanned Shadow drone collided with a C-130 cargo plane. The cargo plane had to make an emergency landing at a base in eastern Afghanistan, but nobody was injured.
A drone occasionally goes awry here, too. In August 2010, the military considered shooting down a Navy Fire Scout drone that wandered close to restricted airspace near Washington, D.C., after controllers lost their link to the drone. But controllers regained contact.
Smaller drones need rules
The legislation  calls for the FAA to set up six experimental locations where drones can fly. Competition for them and the high-paying jobs among researchers and manufacturers they're expected to attract has already begun.
"Members are already jockeying for their particular area," says Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, co-chairman of a House caucus of 49 members who advocate using drones.
The legislation also calls on the FAA to establish rules for smaller drones weighing up to 55 pounds within 27 months. The schedule for all drones is Sept. 30, 2015.
A key unresolved question is how to avoid collisions. The philosophy since the Wright brothers has been for pilots to "see and avoid" other aircraft. Without a pilot on board, the strategy for drones is "sense and avoid," perhaps giving off a signal that other planes receive.
"You've got to find a way to apply today's technology to regulations that were written many years ago," says Bobby Sturgell, a former FAA head and now a senior vice president for Rockwell Collins, which makes navigational and other equipment for drones. "The message behind the legislation is, 'Let's make this happen.'"

Citizens have a right to record; 
Just as law enforcement uses technology to monitor us, Americans shouldn't be arrested for turning the tables

BYLINE: Ken Paulson

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 9A

LENGTH: 746 words

Imagine Rodney King in the YouTube era.
The beating captured on a camcorder in 1991 was seen on at least 240 TV stations around the world, impressive for pre-digital days, and served notice on law enforcement officers that cameras could capture them at their best -- and worst. Today, when laughing babies can yield 42 million views, images of officers beating a suspect would go viral in minutes.
"Early on in their training, I always tell them, 'I don't care if you're in a bathroom taking care of your personal business.  Whatever you do, assume it will be caught on video,'" Sgt. Heather Fungaroli of the Los Angeles Police Department told the Los Angeles Times on the 20th anniversary of the controversial arrest. 
Predictably, with video cameras far more commonplace and smartphones doubling as video devices, Americans are increasingly documenting police conduct through audio and video recordings.
Not so predictable: Many are getting arrested or having recordings confiscated:
In Rochester, N.Y., last  spring, Emily Good was charged with obstruction of governmental administration after she shot video of police making a traffic stop. Good was standing in her front yard at the time. The charges were later dropped.
Pending in a U.S. district court in Maryland is a lawsuit filed by Christopher Sharp, who recorded the arrest of a friend by Baltimore police in 2010. The police confiscated his phone and deleted a number of his videos, including family recordings.
Last month,  Boston police acknowledged that officers used "unreasonable judgment" in arresting Simon Glik, who used his cellphone to shoot the arrest of a man on Boston Common in 2007. Glik is now suing the police department.
High school student Khaliah Fitchette was arrested by Newark police in 2010 for shooting video of their response to someone falling on a city bus. She was handcuffed and taken to a detention facility, and her video was erased. She was never formally charged and is suing the police.
A freelance photographer on Long Island was arrested in July after he shot video of officers arresting suspects in  a police chase. Phil Datz videotaped his own arrest after an officer ordered him to stop shooting on the public street. After the officer's conduct was widely viewed on YouTube (213,000 times to date), the Suffolk County Police Department decided to drop the charges.
Citizens are sometimes arrested under eavesdropping laws that were designed to prevent the surreptitious recording of a conversation. But does a police officer have a reasonable expectation of privacy while he's doing his job? And how surreptitious can it be when the camera is in full view?
The cases involving videos of officers generally don't involve brutality or overt misconduct. More typically, citizens are documenting their own or friends' exchanges with police; they want something on the record.
Arresting citizens and confiscating videos can mean the violation of three different constitutional guarantees. Gathering information about public employees is protected by the First Amendment, while confiscating recordings can violate the search and seizure clause of the Fourth and the equal protection guarantee of the 14th Amendment. That's quite a trifecta.
That's why it was so heartening to see the U.S. Department of Justice step up in federal court last month  in the  Sharp case, clearly signaling its opposition to the practice of arresting citizens with video cameras.
"The right to record police officers while performing duties in a public place, as well as the right to be protected from the warrantless seizure and destruction of those recordings, are not only required by the Constitution," the department wrote to the U.S. District Court in Maryland. "They are consistent with our fundamental notions of liberty, promote the accountability of our government officers, and instill public confidence in the police officers who serve us daily."
Just as police officers use technology to watch citizens, including patrol car cameras, traffic light cameras and radar to track speeding, the public has a right to monitor the work of officers on the public payroll.
Like it or not, everything we do in public can be recorded, posted and distributed around the globe in seconds, and no ordinance, state law or department policy is going to change that. The world is watching.

China documentary makers keep rolling; 
Despite pressure from national censors, independent directors continue to get their visions of life on film and find an audience

BYLINE: Calum MacLeod, USA TODAY

Their subjects include people living at the margins of society, fighting property demolition, tracing the death of relatives persecuted under Chairman Mao, and even a government official discussing the corruption and bullying rife in his City Hall.
As China's Communist Party boosts efforts worldwide to soften its image, a determined and growing band of independent filmmakers documents the complex, often uncomfortable realities of China's past and present.
"The authorities believe these films, and the people who make them, are all problematic," says Zhang Qi, organizer of an independent film festival in a sprawling artists' village in east Beijing. "Officials fear it's a big land mine that could explode at any time." 
From running ads in New York City's Times Square to broadcasting in U.S. cable markets, China spends big money to get its views aired. This week, propaganda-heavy China Central Television (CCTV) launched programming for American viewers produced out of a new office building steps away from the White House.
Among the producers of the English-language news broadcasts will be several U.S. journalists hired from Bloomberg TV, NBC and Fox News in bureaus throughout North and South America. CCTV says its operations in the USA will have autonomy from the People's Republic of China. At home, the PRC is tightening decades-long controls on the content of movies and TV programs to promote Chinese culture it prefers: safe, socialist and state-run.
Beijing police raided the opening ceremony of Zhang's independent film festival, and a strict censorship system blocks many films from being seen by mainstream Chinese. Still, the independent documentaries reach a tiny audience within China, and their directors insist the stories are so good and important that they will keep on shooting.
"The political challenges are greater than the financial, so filmmakers must still be careful in choosing their topics," says Zhu Rikun, a veteran documentary producer and supporter. Last May, authorities canceled a documentary film festival Zhu was directing and banned his Fanhall Films website, a forum for debate.
Despite the harassment,  the number of independent documentary makers has passed 100 over the past two years, he says. The digital age has slashed equipment costs, while the Internet and pirated films, commonplace in China, offer cheap inspiration to budding directors, Zhu says. Foreign film festivals provide crucial support, he says.
State broadcaster CCTV launched a channel for documentaries last year, "but they are not independent, they are still propaganda," Zhu says.
Among the films Zhu doubts would ever be shown on CCTV is Xu Xin's Karamay, which tells the story of a fire in 1994 that killed 288 schoolchildren who were ordered to remain seated to allow officials to leave first.
"Such a film is like a hidden history, as nobody wants to talk about such topics in public," says Zhu, who reopened his website last month by switching to a server outside China. "This film can make Chinese people rethink about life, our history and society."
In China,  "the government has a complete stranglehold on culture," says David Bandurski, a Hong Kong-based film producer and China media analyst.
Chinese film directors face  censorship "effective enough to shut them out of the mainstream scene, so they don't impact domestic public opinion," he says.
So many contemporary issues are considered sensitive that directors who seek official approval and thus the right to screen in movie theaters often set fictional films "in the romanticized, dynastic past," he says. Instead of becoming a culturally strong nation as Beijing plans, China risks becoming "a nation of cultural relics," Bandurski says.
Gritty reality is in plain view in the films of director Xu Tong, whose "vagabonds" trilogy documents people at the bottom of Chinese society.
"I want to show the complexity of society," he says. "These are real social situations. Even if I can't show the films in cinemas, or not many people can see them now, I don't care. I have the duty and desire to record their stories."
Xu is proud of the independent film community's perseverance in the face of censorship. Director Zhang Bingjian is still smiling even though police hassle him when he shoots, and censors block his films.
"China is such an exciting place now; it's too interesting a subject," says Zhang, 52, who spent a decade in the USA. His film Ready Made follows two ordinary people, including a woman whose resemblance to Mao leads her  to a  double-life impersonating him for money at nightclubs and  malls.
Films such as Ready Made, which offer plenty of laughs, show  that "Chinese documentary" does not always mean bleak and political, says He Zhong, founder of Trainspotting, a film-themed restaurant in Beijing that shows independent, unapproved films. Police have never interrupted a screening, which "shows more that I am careful, rather than that the authorities are tolerant," says He, who did not show  sensitive films such as Karamay and Zhao Liang's Petition, which follows desperate citizens in their futile search for justice.
"We don't want confrontation," says film festival organizer Zhang Qi, "we just want to be able to express our own voice."

Kia Track'ster concept is a Soul that cops a 'tude; 
Ford also is updating its Police Interceptor

BYLINE: Chris Woodyard, USA TODAY

SECTION: MONEY; Pg. 3B

LENGTH: 613 words

Put a Kia Soul on steroids, give it even more attitude and you pretty much have the concept that the South Korean automaker brought to the Chicago Auto Show.
The Track'ster definitely turned heads and was the star of the show. Give Kia credit for amping up the fun factor at an auto show that's usually long on practically and short on flights of fancy.
Track'ster is 5 inches wider and an inch longer than the Soul crossover. With those big LED fog lights, a front end that looks like Darth Vader's mask and "inferno orange" paint accents, it's a mean machine. 
"The idea was to make the Track'ster tough looking, like a bulldog," said Tom Kearns, Kia's chief U.S. designer. "But the car had to be approachable as well. We wanted to base the car in reality so people instantly knew it was a Soul, but with a lot of attitude."
Ford updates Taurus police car for 2013
The Taurus-based police car has barely shown up in your rearview mirror, but that hasn't stopped Ford from giving it the new, refreshed look of the 2013 Taurus.
Showing the redone Police Interceptor here first is only appropriate since it, like other models of Taurus, is made at Ford's Chicago plant.
Among cop-friendly features: The shifter moves from the console to the steering wheel. It's hardly three-on-a-tree, but it still looks decidedly retro. Ford's marketing manager for police vehicles, Lisa Teed, says buyers need the console clear to make space for computers.
The car has only rubber mats, not carpeting. The speedometer is basic, but is certified for catching speeders. The car has heavy-duty steel wheels, nothing fancy. The Interceptor front end has the new 2013 Taurus look, but with its own black grille with wide openings for extra air intake.
Our favorite feature is the "contraband box," a lockable cubby in the trunk. If it's not holding cocaine, officers can lock their guns or small valuables in there when they visit jails.
Acura shows new entry-level sedan
With little fanfare, Acura unveiled the production version of its new entry-level sedan here.
Unlike the concept shown in Detroit last month, this one includes the full production interior, which adds a lot to the car's overall appeal.
The 2013 Acura ILX, as it will be known, is aimed at  successful twenty- and thirtysomethings who happen to have more money than most of their peers and may be looking for their first luxury vehicle. To lure them, Acura is putting a premium on technology and fuel economy, including a version that is Acura's first hybrid.
The base engine is a 2-liter inline four-cylinder engine rated 150 horsepower and mated to a five-speed automatic. Next is a 2.4-liter, 201 horsepower engine with a six-speed manual. And then there is the hybrid with a 1.5-liter engine with electric motors that will get an estimated 35 miles per gallon in the city, 38 on the highway.
Other technology includes standard keyless entry and ignition, Pandora Internet radio and the ability to send text messages from the car. The ILX will be made at Honda's plant in Greenville, Ind.
Hyundai unleashes first Elantra coupe
Hyundai seems intent on turning its Elantra into a "family" of vehicles, showing a new coupe in addition to a new hatchback.
The coupe is sleek, as you might expect, and CEO John Krafcik thinks it will be popular with more women than men. That's OK: The new hatch shown Wednesday may skew more male.
It's a small coupe that feels big. It has two fewer doors but loses little of the sedan's interior,  though backseat headroom could be an issue. The coupe's trunk is just as functional as the sedan's: flat with a large opening and the same 14.8 cubic feet of cargo space.

Tebow inspires Knicks' Lin

BYLINE: Rachel Shuster; Jeff Zillgitt

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 6C

LENGTH: 688 words

Add Jeremy Lin, the emerging
New York Knicks star, to
those who say Denver Broncos
quarterback Tim Tebow is an
inspiration.
Lin, 23, who has led the
Knicks to three consecutive victories
and faces the Los Angeles
Lakers today, told 95.7 The
Game in San Francisco: "The 
things he says in interviews, his
approach to the game is just
unbelievable, and I respect him
so much. I want to be able to do
some of the things that he does
in terms of the amount of charity
work and the non-profit
work and the way he impacts
people off the field. I think that
is what is most inspiring."
Lin is having an impact, too.
MSG Network, the Knicks
broadcast station, said its ratings
were up 36% over the season
average for the last two
games, when Lin became an
NBA starter for the first time.
He also has supporters
around the league. Phoenix
Suns guard Steve Nash wrote
on Twitter, "If you love sports
you have to love what Jeremy
Lin is doing. Getting an opportunity
and exploding!!"
All-Star reserves: Players filling
out the East and West
squads were named Thursday
for the All-Star Game in Orlando
on Feb. 26.
East: Guard -- Atlanta Hawks'
Joe Johnson, New Jersey Nets'
Deron Williams; forward--Miami
Heat's Chris Bosh, Chicago
Bulls' Luol Deng, Philadelphia
76ers' Andre Iguodala, Boston
Celtics' Paul Pierce; center --
Indiana Pacers' Roy Hibbert.
West: Guard -- Suns' Nash,
San Antonio Spurs' Tony Parker,
Oklahoma City Thunder's
Russell Westbrook; forward --
Portland Trail Blazers' LaMarcus
Aldridge, Minnesota Timberwolves'
Kevin Love, Dallas
Mavericks' Dirk Nowitzki; center
-- Memphis Grizzlies' Marc
Gasol.
First-timers among the reserves
are Aldridge, Deng, Hibbert
and Iguodala.
Perhaps the most notable selection
is Nowitzki, who is having
an off year at 17.6 points a
game, his lowest in 12 seasons.
Those whose streaks will end
unless named an injury replacement
include three forwards:
the Celtics' Kevin Garnett (14 in
a row), the Spurs' Tim Duncan
(13) and the Knicks' Amar'e
Stoudemire (five).
Irving update: Cleveland Cavaliers
rookie guard Kyrie Irving
is being evaluated at the Cleveland
Clinic as he recovers from a
concussion that caused him to
miss his first game of the season,
Wednesday's win vs. the
Los Angeles Clippers.
Irving was injured in Tuesday's
loss to Miami when he
was accidentally kneed in the
head by the Heat's Dwyane
Wade, and he complained of a
headache while warming up
Wednesday.
There is no timetable for Irving's
return.
Olympic update: USA Basketball
chairman Jerry Colangelo
reiterated that he would
not replace Clippers guard
Chauncey Billups (torn left
Achilles) in the Team USA pool
of players for the 2012 London
Olympics.
The list stands at 19 and will
be narrowed to 12 by June 18.
Colangelo is watching injuries
this NBA season and did not
rule out asking the U.S. Olympic
Committee for a waiver to add
someone if more players, especially
a big man, get seriously
hurt. But even an extenuating
circumstance does not guarantee
the USOC will grant the
waiver.
Colangelo had to submit the
20-man pool to the USOC by the
end of January so those players
could be part of the U.S. Anti-
Doping Agency's drug testing
program.
Also: Lakers guard Steve Blake
returned Thursday vs. the Celtics
after sitting 15 games with
fractured cartilage in his right
rib cage. He was cleared
Wednesday and practiced with
the team. . . . The Hawks, shorthanded
at center with injuries
to Al Horford (torn chest muscle)
and Jason Collins (strained
elbow), signed 15-year veteran
Erick Dampier , 36, to a 10-day
contract. He played in 51 games
with the Heat last season.

Actors and action hold the key to 'Safe House'; 
Washington and Reynolds square off on familiar turf

BYLINE: Claudia Puig

SECTION: LIFE; Pg. 3D

LENGTH: 533 words

Safe House has two powerful performances at its core, a hectic plot, a huge body count and a mild sense of dj vu amid the pulse-quickening tension.
Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds have terrific chemistry as two men linked by their CIA affiliation, and the slick story has moments of breathless excitement. But it occasionally stumbles by putting Washington too frequently in observer mode. Sometimes he provides a much-needed sense of calm, but in other scenes, he's confined to the sidelines, while Reynolds' character focuses on a  dull romance with a French medical student (Nora Arnezeder). 
Reynolds plays Matt Weston, a low-level CIA "housekeeper" in Cape Town, South Africa, in charge of a  safe house where suspects are taken by CIA operatives to be interrogated, and sometimes tortured, to induce them to talk.
Washington is Tobin Frost, the agency's most notorious traitor. His superb performance suggests deep reserves of knowledge, and his character comes off as  world-weary and wry. It's as if he embodies the Elvis Costello line "I used to be disgusted, and now I try to be amused."
As the idealistic Weston, Reynolds is pitch-perfect. He goes  from bored rookie to an anxious guy in way over his head and trying desperately to keep up. He even gets roughed up believably, as his handsome features get scratched up and are overtaken by beady-eyed wariness.
Their paths cross when Frost turns up in Cape Town after years of eluding authorities. Within the first minutes, we see him cleverly conceal an all-important computer file, mysteriously avoid a sharpshooter's bullet and escape from a horde of nimble assassins. Then he mystifies everyone by turning himself in at the U.S. Embassy.
From there, Frost is brought to the house managed by Weston. Shortly thereafter, the house comes under siege, and the only two who survive  are Frost and Weston.
Determined and principled but untested, Weston whisks Frost off, determined to turn him over to CIA brass. High-adrenaline chases ensue, as do double- and triple-crossing. Frost is an expert manipulator, but Weston, an ambitious Yale grad, does his best to remain in charge. Their story becomes one of mentor and protg as the trust-no-one atmosphere crescendos.
Director Daniel Espinosa seems to have borrowed a page  from the book of Bourne franchise director Paul Greengrass. But where those thrillers are consistently suspenseful with taut, intricate plots, Safe House's weakest point is structural. It builds up to an  anticlimactic resolution that should be more politically complex.
Still, Espinosa directs with flair, particularly during a chase that involves Washington jumping across shanty roofs, dodging bullets.
It's a familiar tale of conspiracy and corruption at nearly every level, as well as idealism shattered. But told as it is with energy and verve, Safe House is a bracing action thriller made all the more watchable because of its two lead performances.

Injured N.J. officer wins $5.9M judgment

BYLINE: Melanie Eversley with staff and wire reports

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 551 words

An off-duty New Jersey county sheriff's officer who was shot and seriously hurt in a domestic dispute has won a $5.9million civil judgment against the gunman. 
Joshua Hahn, 34, a Merced County sheriff's officer, suffered two punctured lungs and a shattered vertebra in July 2007 when he tried to break up a fight at a Hamilton Township pizzeria between Billy Heisler and his sister.
Heisler was convicted last month on attempted-murder and weapons charges. After Heisler failed to respond to the civil suit, a judge awarded the money to Hahn and his wife. Hahn has retired on permanent disability. The award includes $2.5million in punitive damages, $1.5million for pain and suffering and $963,871 in lost wages.
Ala. man to be tried in wife's '03 death
An Alabama man who has already served prison time in Australia after pleading guilty to a reduced charged in the death of his bride goes to trial today  in Birmingham, accused of murdering her for insurance money.
Tina Thomas Watson drowned during a scuba dive on the Great Barrier Reef just days after her wedding in October 2003.
Gabe Watson, 34, is charged with capital murder, which usually is punishable by death, but he faces life in prison without parole if convicted because of a deal the state made years ago with Australia to guarantee his return to the USA.
Tina Watson's father, Tommy Thomas, said the family has endured eight years of delays and disappointments getting to the trial date.
Pastor's daughter shot at Fla. church
The daughter of a pastor in St. Petersburg, Fla., was accidentally shot in the head Sunday and critically injured, authorities said.
Hannah Kelley, 20, was struck at the Grace Connection Church shortly after noon as church member Moises Zambrana was showing his gun to another church member interesting in buying a firearm, according to the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office.
Zambrana, who has a concealed weapons permit, removed the gun's magazine and was not aware there was a bullet in the chamber, the sheriff's office said. The bullet penetrated a wall, hitting Kelley.  No charges have been filed.
Utah man charged with threats
A Utah man who police say threatened to assassinate Republican Gov. Gary Herbert and who conducted surveillance on the governor's mansion is facing multiple felony charges.
Brian  Baker, 52, has been charged in Salt Lake City with felony counts of drug and weapons possession, along with a misdemeanor count of threatening elected officials.
Baker sent text messages to a friend Feb.2 stating that he was lying in the bushes and intended to kill the governor, court records said. The recipient of the texts reported the messages to police, and Baker was arrested the same day.
Clues sought in recycling in Powell case
Volunteers sifted through tons of paper at a recycling center Sunday, hoping to find items that Josh Powell may have dumped before killing himself and his two sons in a house fire last week.
Powell was the husband of missing Utah woman Susan Powell. He attacked his 5- and 7-year-old sons with a hatchet Feb. 5,  when a social worker brought the boys to his home for  a supervised visit and then ignited the house.

Terrorism trial begins in Michigan

BYLINE: Tresa Baldas

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 307 words

The government says they're homegrown terrorists who plotted to kill police officers with bombs and guns.
Their defense lawyers say they're tough-talking, good ol' boys who had no real plans to harm anyone. 
Today, two years after federal agents arrested nine people suspected to be Hutaree militia members in separate raids in  Michigan and Indiana, the highly anticipated terrorism trial begins here in federal court.
All the suspects are charged with seditious conspiracy, attempting to use weapons of mass destruction and possession of a firearm in relation to a crime of violence. If convicted, they  could face life in prison.
The trial is likely to put the First Amendment to the test. The defense claims free speech is under attack and the defendants are being prosecuted for criticizing the government.
Attorney Todd Shanker,  representing defendant David Stone Jr., has said, "We just can't ignore the First Amendment."
The prosecution argues the defendants aren't on trial for their words, but for being part of a conspiracy to kill law enforcement officers.
"Because of the dangers presented by criminal conspiracies, there is a strong government interest in thwarting such conspiracies before they ripen into violent action," prosecutors wrote in court documents.
The Hutaree group is accused of plotting to kill a law enforcement officer and then bomb the funeral. The group also is accused of preparing a hit list of judges, business leaders, educators and others.
Much of the evidence at trial is expected to be secretly recorded statements and conversations between the accused Hutaree members and the two undercover operatives who infiltrated the group.
Defense lawyers disclosed some of the government's secret recordings and  say that just because militia members were talking, it doesn't mean  actual terrorism plans were underway.

Wings rally to beat Flyers; 
20th victory in row in Detroit

BYLINE: Kevin Allen

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 6C

LENGTH: 478 words

To tie a league record that has been unchallenged for 36 years, the Detroit Red Wings needed smart play from a 42-year-old legend.
Captain Nicklas Lidstrom slid  deep in the Philadelphia Flyers zone and set up Johan Franzen for a third-period, game-winning goal to beat the Flyers 4-3 and tie the NHL record of 20 home wins in a row. 
"We've had some great teams here over the years," Lidstrom said. "But we haven't been close to this record, so we should be proud of it."
The Red Wings will go for a  record  21 when they face the Dallas Stars on Tuesday at Joe Louis Arena.
The Red Wings twice erased one-goal deficits to tie the mark that was originally set by the 1929-30 Boston Bruins and then tied by the 1975-76 Flyers.
"We haven't really talked much about this as it was going on," Lidstrom said. "Every day, it's just been getting ready for the next game."
In the 20 victories, the Red Wings have had three shootout wins and one overtime triumph. The first 13 wins in the streak were  regulation wins.
"We've been lucky, and we've been pretty good," said Franzen, who scored the winner 52 seconds into the third period.
Detroit already owned the league record of 12 consecutive road wins, set in 2005-06.
"They picked us apart a few times out there, and that was the difference," Flyers winger Scott Hartnell said.
Henrik Zetterberg had tied the score 3-3 at 18:21 of the second period when he fired a lengthy shot from the slot past goalie Sergei Bobrovsky, who has played three consecutive games because Ilya Bryzgalov has flu-like symptoms. Bryzgalov was able to serve as backup.
"You are tied 3-3 going into the third, and you look around our room and you think who's going to score," Red Wings goalie Joey MacDonald said. "There are so many great hockey players on this team.  It was a great goal and a great play by Nick to pass it over. It's just determination."
MacDonald was called up from Grand Rapid (Mich.) of the American Hockey League because Jimmy Howard has a broken finger on his blocker hand. He made 26 saves against the Flyers and now has three wins in the streak.
"We're a confident team going into the third period," Lidstrom said.
McDonald returns: When St. Louis Blues forward Andy McDonald returned last season from a concussion, he gave the team an offensive boost with 33 points in 33 games.
McDonald got off to a good start Sunday, with an assist in his first appearance since he suffered a concussion Oct.13 in the third game this season.
He was activated  after missing 51 games. Last season, he had missed 24.
The Blues put Matt D'Agostini (concussion) on the injured list. He has missed three games.
Around the rinks:  Lidstrom played in his 1,550th game Sunday, passing Alex Delvecchio for second most in Red Wings history. Gordie Howe leads with 1,687 games.  Steve Downie set a Tampa Bay Lightning record Sunday by scoring goals 11 seconds apart.

More say 'I do' to insurance; 
Wedding policies save the day if a caterer goes bankrupt or mom gets ill

BYLINE: Sarah Meehan, USA TODAY

SECTION: MONEY; Pg. 3B

LENGTH: 765 words

At age 14, Sarah Williams had already chosen Maryland's Eastern Shore as the backdrop for her wedding.
Last August when the bride-to-be, now 25, booked a sprawling plantation on the Wye River for her reception, plans for the fairy tale wedding of her childhood dreams started to crystallize. She selected a caterer, florist and DJ for the September wedding, and her father, Stephen Williams, shelled out nearly $10,000 for the facility.
But by early December, the reception hall had filed for bankruptcy and gone up for public auction -- without any warning to the Williams family. 
Such a pre-wedding disaster is not unusual, wedding insurance providers say. During the last several years, many wedding insurance policyholders have filed claims because venues and vendors have gone out of business before the big day.
"The claims are shooting up through the walls -- the DJ goes out of business, the photographer goes out of business, the venue takes your money and is actually in bankruptcy," says Robert Nuccio, president and CEO of R.V. Nuccio & Associates, the program administrator for Fireman's Fund wedding insurance. "When they take your money, they're already out of business."
Last year, about a third of wedding insurance claims with both Travelers Insurance (31%) and WedSafe, a unit of Aon, (38%) fell under vendor or venue mishaps.
While the recession is largely to blame for these suppliers going under, it has also prompted wedding financiers to approach their nuptials with financial caution, says Chantal Cyr, vice president of personal insurance for Travelers.
"People are more in tune than ever to protect their investments," Cyr says. "It's a significant investment -- it's like buying a car and not insuring a car."
WedSafe has seen a 60% jump in policy sales since 2007, says Aon Vice President Steven Lauro, and Travelers has also seen steady increases in wedding insurance sales during the same period.
Premiums vary based on the overall cost of a wedding, and many insurance providers allow customers to cover wedding particulars -- such as photography, the gown or wedding bands -- for additional charges. Cancellation coverage typically insures these items, and liability insurance, which venues are increasingly requiring couples to carry, protects the hosts against injuries to guests or property damage.
Weddings cost an average of $26,501, according to the 2011  Brides American Wedding Study. To insure a typical wedding -- a $25,000 celebration, for example -- premiums range from $320 to $420, which includes both cancellation and liability coverage, as well as insurance for items such as attire, photography and wedding gifts.
"In this volatile economy, wedding insurance is a wise investment and only costs a fraction of the goods and deposits it covers," says David Wood, president of the Association of Bridal Consultants.
However, if the wedding party knows its providers closely -- or if the vendors are highly reputable -- wedding insurance may not be necessary, Wood says.
Without a separate wedding insurance policy, couples can protect select aspects of their wedding through homeowner's or renter's insurance, which often covers wedding gifts and engagement rings. However, some couples are still unaware they can insure everything from the rehearsal dinner to the after party, several insurance representatives say.
"Some people just don't realize that they have the option of protecting their wedding, and they don't realize the risk that they're running in not protecting it," Lauro says.
Others, such as filmmaker Cory McGee, accept that risk. McGee was married last August and opted not to insure her wedding.
"I'm a huge risk-taker in life, and I never thought that buying wedding insurance was worth it because had I died or had something tragic happened before the wedding, I think it has something to do with fate," McGee says, noting her wedding went off without a hitch.
Williams was more wary, and with good reason. With less than a year before the big day, it wouldn't be easy for her to re-create the wedding she had pictured since her teens, but a policy her father purchased from Travelers helped them recover his full deposit and reserve a new waterfront location.
Although she pushed the ceremony back by a month, Williams found a new site on the Chester River, where she will tie the knot in October.
"She has the water again," Stephen Williams says. "It made a painful situation a little easier."
Insurance may have helped smooth this snag, but it might not be the last of Stephen Williams' wedding anxieties. He has two more unmarried daughters.

Washington state legalizes gay marriage

BYLINE: John Bacon with staff and wire reports

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 572 words

Gov. Chris Gregoire signed a bill Monday legalizing same-sex marriage in Washington state, making it the seventh in the nation to allow gay and lesbian couples to wed. "I'm proud our same-sex couples will no longer be treated as separate but equal," the Democrat said.
The law takes effect June 7, but opponents filed  a ballot challenge that would require voters to either uphold or overturn the law. If the referendum gets enough signatures, the law will be put on hold pending the outcome of a November vote. 
Also Monday:
New Jersey's state Senate passed a bill to recognize same-sex marriages. The bill has strong support in the state House, but Republican Gov. Chris Christie has promised a veto.
Girl accused in Columbine High attack
A female student attacked two students with a hammer at Colorado's Columbine High School -- once the scene of one of the most deadly school shootings in U.S. history, authorities said.
John McDonald, the Jefferson County School District security director,  said the 14-year-old suspect targeted a 15-year-old girl in a bathroom. A male student saw the attack developing and was injured while stopping it.  The victims were taken to a hospital and later released.
The Littleton high school was where two  students opened fire on April 20, 1999, killing 12 classmates and a teacher and wounding 26 others before killing themselves.
Florida A&M hazing victim sues bus line
The parents of a Florida A&M band member who died after being hazed filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against the owner and driver of the charter bus where the ritual took place.
The lawsuit says hazing included forcing pledges to run from the front to the back of the bus while  band members slap, kick and hit them. In another ritual, a pillow case was placed over the pledge's nose and mouth while the pledge was forced to answer questions. A pledge with a wrong answer was given another question without a chance to take a breath, the suit says.
The lawsuit says the bus company managers knew about the hazing but ignored it. Ray Land, owner of Fabulous Coach Lines, said he needed time to prepare a statement.
Library releases Jackie Kennedy papers
The John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum released some of former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy's personal papers that her children donated to the library.
The papers include script changes for the first lady's Feb. 14, 1962, televised tour that library officials said drew 80 million viewers after syndication. Library Director Tom Putnam said the papers show the range of Kennedy's understanding of art, history and public diplomacy.
Quake rattles Northern California
A moderate earthquake struck Northern California's coast, rattling nerves around the Oregon border but yielding no immediate reports of major injury or damage, officials said.
The U.S. Geological Survey said the magnitude-5.6 quake struck at 1:07 p.m. about 18 miles east of Trinidad. The epicenter was a rural area near the small community of Weitchpec, about 220 miles northwest of Sacramento.
High court justice robbed in Caribbean
The FBI is investigating the robbery of Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer at his West Indies vacation home by a machete-wielding suspect, authorities said.
Breyer, 73, wife Joanna and guests were confronted by the robber Thursday on the island of Nevis, Supreme Court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg said. No one was injured, but the suspect made off with about $1,000.--Kevin Johnson

80% affected by recent years' fierce weather

BYLINE: John Bacon with staff and wire reports

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 601 words

Violent and deadly weather events have affected more than 240 million Americans -- nearly 80% of the nation's population -- over the past six years, says a report out today from an environmental advocacy group.
Last year was particularly awful for weather: At least 14 weather and climate disasters across the nation  each inflicted more than $1 billion in damage, Environment America reports. 
Nathan Willcox, an Environment America program director, said global warming was a likely culprit. Kristen Averyt, a scientist with the University of Colorado who was not part of the report, was less willing to blame weather woes on climate change. "Extreme events like the Texas drought are consistent with what we expect in a warmer world, but determining whether climate change caused or exacerbated a specific event is not easy."--Doyle Rice
Last Katrina trailer leaves New Orleans
The last of the FEMA trailers has been removed from New Orleans more than six years after floodwalls and levees broke during Hurricane Katrina and caused the city to flood, the Federal Emergency Management Agency said.
FEMA said the people living in the trailer moved into their rebuilt home last week. New Orleans at one time had more than 23,000 FEMA trailers. Some were  eyesores, but people relied on them because of such hurdles as scarce rebuilding funds and health and personal problems.
Cincinnati cracks down on scrap metal
Cincinnati adopted some of the nation's toughest restrictions on scrap metal sales in an effort to curb theft. The City Council approved rules that require frequent sellers to pay for licenses, pass background checks and wait two days to get paid.
City police say high metal prices have encouraged theft, with up to 40% of break-ins involving thieves ripping away air conditioners, plumbing and cables from homes and businesses. "It's a first step in the effort to really get a better handle on this issue," Councilman Cecil Thomas said.
Fatal shooting was sixth by Ariz. officer
An Arizona police officer who fatally shot a man holding a baby had been involved in five other fatal shootings since 2002, authorities said.
Officer James Peters was among officers called to the Scottsdale home Tuesday after neighbors reported a man holding a baby was threatening them with a handgun. Police Chief Alan Rodbell said James Loxas, 50, opened the door with the 9-month-old boy in his arms but would not come out. Peters shot Loxas in the head with a rifle. The baby was unhurt. The previous shootings were within policy, Rodbell said.
Chicago proposal shields cellular access
A Chicago alderman proposed an ordinance that would ban police from pulling the plug on electronic communication during protests at the Group of Eight and NATO summits in May.
Authorities in Egypt and the San Francisco Bay Area cut off cellular access during protests last year. "We're putting down a marker and saying this has happened in other places and we don't even want it considered here," Alderman Ricardo Munoz said.
Robonaut shows firm space handshake
The commander of the International Space Station shook hands with Robonaut, providing what NASA called the first handshake ever between a human and a humanoid in space.
NASA's Robonaut was launched aboard space shuttle Discovery last February. On Wednesday, ground controllers activated computer software that enabled the robot to extend its right hand, fingers outstretched. Daniel Burbank took the mechanical hand and pumped it up and down, as the robot's fingers tightened around his hand.
"For the record, it was a firm handshake," Burbank radioed. "Quite an impressive robot."

'Undefeated' scores outside the lines; 
Football just a start for Oscar nominee

BYLINE: Review By Claudia Puig

SECTION: LIFE; Pg. 2D

LENGTH: 546 words

Undefeated chronicles a championship season but covers turf that extends miles beyond the football field.
A coming-of-age story, a tale of a dedicated coach and an inspirational sports saga, this Oscar-nominated documentary is a stirring testament to resilience and determination amid staggering odds. Directors Daniel Lindsay and T.J Martin provide an intimate view of a sorely underprivileged group of African-American high school football players in north Memphis.
One of the most eye-opening segments has little to do with football but everything to do with why their story is important. Speaking to the team, former NFL player Aaron Hayden asks how many have two parents who graduated from college. No hands are raised. But when he asks how many have had a close relative in jail, nearly every hand goes up. 
"You've got to think outside your circumstances," Hayden tells them. "It's not where you start, it's where you finish."
Succinctly put, that's what Undefeated is all about.
The film opens in 2009 with Bill Courtney, a volunteer coach at Manassas High School -- and a tough-love proponent if ever there was one -- listing absent students: "Starting right guard shot, one linebacker shot, two players fighting right in front of the coach, star center arrested for shooting someone in the face with BB gun. For most coaches that would be pretty much a career's worth of crap to deal with. I think that sums up the last two weeks for me."
One of the film's first scenes features a startling view of the neighborhood surrounding the school. Shack-like homes, abandoned buildings and shuttered businesses fill the landscape.
Courtney's mantra: "Young men of character and discipline and commitment end up winning in life.  Football doesn't build character. Football reveals character."
Some of the players he coaches make powerful impressions. There's O.C. the hulking left tackle, an easygoing senior who lives in a tiny house with his grandmother and sees football as his way out of Memphis. Montrail, aka Money, plays right tackle. His father, who died when he was 13, emphasized education.
Courtney points out that Money, who has a 3.8 GPA, is "always outmanned physically and he always wins. That's not because he's some physical specimen. It's because he's so mentally tough."
How these kids come together as a team and face down obstacles and personal demons is riveting.
The well-crafted film's only misstep is the use of occasional subtitles accompanying some of the players' dialogue. Their words are understandable, and there's something demeaning about attempting to translate their diction.
Deftly balancing the students' stories with that of Courtney's,  the film creates a fully rounded portrait of a corner of America rarely examined. Where 2009's The Blind Side scratched the surface, focusing on one African-American football player adopted by an affluent white family, Undefeated gives a more comprehensive account.
By the end of the season, students have indeed revealed their depth of character. It's impossible to be unmoved by the struggles and accomplishments detailed in Undefeated.

Aretha Franklin and Stevie Wonder will be among those performing Saturday at the invitation-only funeral of Whitney Houston in her hometown of Newark, a publicist said Thursday.
Kristen Foster also confirmed that invitations went out to Houston's ex-husband, Bobby Brown; her co-star in The Bodyguard, Kevin Costner; and Oprah Winfrey. The eulogy will be given by gospel singer and friend Marvin Winans.
Organizers were preparing the New Hope Baptist Church for the funeral. Fans without invitations will be kept far away: Newark police said streets will be shut down for six square blocks. Houston, 48, died Saturday in Beverly Hills. The cause of death could take weeks to determine pending toxicology reports. 
N.J. pols OK gay marriage; veto expected
The New Jersey Assembly passed a bill to legalize same-sex marriages, sending the bill to Gov. Chris Christie for an expected veto.
The Republican governor opposes gay marriage and had promised "very swift action" if the bill reached his desk. Christie and most Republican lawmakers want gay marriage put on the state ballot. Democrats say gay marriage is a civil right protected by the Constitution and should not be subject to referendum. Six states and Washington, D.C., recognize gay marriages. Washington state's law takes effect in June.
Two die in shooting at ICE office
Two people were fatally shot and one was wounded  at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Long Beach, a law enforcement official told the Associated Press.
The Long Beach police official said the shooter killed one person, wounded another  and then was killed. It was not immediately clear whether the shooter died from a self-inflicted wound. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak publicly.
Two of the victims were agents with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency said. One agent died at the scene. The second agent was wounded and was in stable condition. It was not clear what motivated the shooting.
Judge investigated for his work as D.A.
An investigation will determine whether a former prosecutor who is now a judge hid evidence in a trial that sent an innocent man to prison for nearly 25 years, Texas' chief justice ruled.
A "court of inquiry" will determine whether Judge Ken Anderson, when he was a district attorney, failed to turn over documents that would have supported the defendant's claims of innocence and whether he tampered with records, Chief Justice Wallace Jefferson ruled.
Lawyers for Michael Morton say they hope Anderson faces criminal charges. Morton, 57, spent 24 years in prison before new DNA testing showed he didn't kill his wife, Christine, who was beaten to death  Aug. 13, 1986.
Anti-whaling group wins round in court
A federal judge in Seattle declined to restrain the activities of an  anti-whaling group.
Judge Richard Jones denied a preliminary injunction sought by Japanese whalers against the Washington state-based Sea Shepherd Conservation Society. The whalers group,  the Institute for Cetacean Research,  said the society  rammed their ships off Antarctica during the whaling season, and asked the judge to order them to stop.
The society denied bashing boats and said  its activities are supported by international law.
Pat Buchanan out at MSNBC
MSNBC dropped conservative commentator Pat Buchanan,  four months after suspending him following publication of his  book Suicide of a Superpower.  The network said that "after 10 years, we have decided to part ways.   We wish him well." Buchanan, in a column,  called the decision "an undeniable victory for the blacklisters."

Love rolling; big tests for Lin

BYLINE: J. Michael Falgoust; Jeff Zillgitt

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 8C

LENGTH: 651 words

Every Monday, USA TODAY NBA reporters Jeff Zillgitt and J. Michael Falgoust look at the weekend's best and the week ahead and project leaders across the statistical spectrum.
Lines of the weekend
Minnesota Timberwolves F Kevin Love: 33 points on 11-for-16 shooting, 17 rebounds, two blocks in a 111-98 win vs. the Houston Rockets on Friday.
Los Angeles Lakers G Kobe Bryant: 36 points on 14-for-25 shooting, nine rebounds, six assists, four steals in a 111-99 win vs. the Phoenix Suns on Friday. 
Orlando Magic C Dwight Howard:  26 points on 8-for-12 shooting, 20 rebounds, four blocks, 10-for-14 at the free throw line in a 94-85 win vs. the Milwaukee Bucks on Friday.
Best games this week
Atlanta Hawks at Chicago Bulls (today, 4 p.m. ET, ESPN): The Bulls have managed through  injuries to guards Derrick Rose and Richard Hamilton and forward Luol Deng. But how long can that last for  last season's Eastern Conference finalists? Chicago lost  two of four games last week without Rose, including Saturday's 97-85 loss to the New Jersey Nets.
New York Knicks at Miami Heat (Thursday, 7 p.m. ET, TNT): During the  8-1 run  with point guard Jeremy Lin in the lineup through Sunday's win vs. the Dallas Mavericks, the Knicks played three teams with a winning record. That changes with the Hawks and Heat left this week, and the Boston Celtics, Mavericks, San Antonio Spurs, Philadelphia 76ers, Bulls, Portland Trail Blazers and Indiana Pacers in the  three weeks after the All-Star break.
Lakers at Oklahoma City Thunder (Thursday, 9:30 p.m. ET, TNT): The past leaders of the West vs. this season's best  in their first meeting.  When the Thunder made the 2010 playoffs in their second season in Oklahoma City, they lost 4-2 in the first round to the eventual champion Lakers.  Bryant led the NBA in scoring entering Sunday.  Thunder forward Kevin Durant is the two-time defending scoring champion.
Top free agent acquisitions
Knicks C Tyson Chandler: The 7-1 veteran, who won a championship with the  Mavericks last season, provided stability with F Carmelo Anthony and F Amar'e Stoudemire out of the lineup for health and personal reasons. Chandler averages 11.8 points, 9.7 rebounds and 1.4 blocks on an improved defensive team that has benefited from Lin's breakout season.
Los Angeles Clippers F Kenyon Martin: He's been limited to seven games and averages 5.6 points, 4.7 rebounds and 1.1 blocks in 23.9 minutes, but it's his defense that makes him valuable. With Martin, the Clippers have outrebounded every opponent and are plus 76 in rebounding in those games.
Trail Blazers G Jamal Crawford: The 2010 Sixth Man of the Year is contributing 14 points and 3.8 assists in 26.2 minutes a game to help replace some of the offensive void from the retirement of Brandon Roy.
Impact players to watch
Timberwolves C Nikola Pekovic: After averaging 5.5 points and 3.0 rebounds as a rookie, the  6-11 center is at 12.6  points and 7.0 rebounds. He has  started 12  games in place of injured C Darko Milicic. In his last six games, Pekovic is averaging 19.5 points and 10.8 rebounds.
New Orleans Hornets F Gustavo Ayon: The 6-10 Mexican rookie forward has started six games and posted double-doubles in his last two starts. He has scored in double figures in his last three games, all wins.
Magic F Ryan Anderson: An everyday starter for the first time in his NBA career, Anderson has developed into one of the best three-point shooters in the league. He averages 16.6 points and 7.2 rebounds, including 3.5 offensive rebounds. He leads the league with 93 three-pointers and is shooting 43.9% on threes.
Top 20-20 games
Magic's Howard: 45 points and 23 rebounds in a 117-109 victory vs. the Golden State Warriors on Jan. 12.
Trail Blazers F LaMarcus Aldridge: 33 points and 23 rebounds in a 94-84 victory vs. the Toronto Raptors on Jan. 20.
Timberwolves'  Love: 32 points and 21 rebounds in a 100-98 loss to the  Knicks on Feb. 11.

Crane moonlighting as crime fighter, sort of

BYLINE: Steve DiMeglio

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 4C

LENGTH: 167 words

Ben Crane has become a YouTube sensation for his unique workout sessions.  And he's a pretty good golfer, with four PGA Tour wins to his credit. 
Now add crime fighter.
A mannequin of Crane holding a golf club thwarted a late-night robbery Friday  in the Copenhagen, Denmark, headquarters of ShowMeGolfers, a golf app that Crane endorses. According to the company, the burglar(s)  broke a window to gain entry but did not take anything, perhaps fleeing from the shadowy image of Crane. The alarm, however, went off, and, upon arriving at the scene, police officers pulled their guns on the Crane lookalike and asked him to drop his gun before realizing it was a mannequin.
No one -- not even the mannequin -- was hurt in the incident.
"This is awesome," Crane  said Monday at the World Golf Championships-Accenture Match Play Championship. "It's weird, I'll tell you that. But it's great news. And I technically saved a major robbery. When the cops got there, they soon realized I had it all under control."

On ESPN action, dating rumors, more

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 3C

LENGTH: 352 words

The editor fired Sunday by ESPN for using a racially offensive headline for a story about Jeremy Lin contends he wasn't making a racist joke and that the wording was unintentional. 
"This had nothing to do with me being cute or punny," Anthony Federico told the New York Daily News on Monday. "I'm so sorry that I offended people. I'm so sorry if I offended Jeremy."
Federico's headline appeared on ESPN's mobile website at 2:30 a.m. Saturday and was removed about a half-hour later.
Federico told the Daily News he understood why he was terminated but added he had used the same phrase "at least 100 times" in past headlines.
He said he was particularly remorseful because, like Lin, he considers himself an "outspoken Christian."
Federico, 28, had worked at ESPN since 2006. Lin said Sunday after his New York Knicks defeated the defending champion Dallas Mavericks that he  accepted ESPN's apology and didn't consider the incident intentional.
In addition to dismissing Federico, ESPN suspended anchor Max Bretos for 30 days for saying the same offensive phrase on-air last week.
ESPN  reporter  Rachel Nichols  had a sit-down interview with Lin that was shown on  ABC's Good Morning America on Monday.
In it, the single, 23-year-old Harvard graduate shot down rumors he's dating reality TV star Kim Kardashian, who recently divorced Kris Humphries of the New Jersey Nets.
He also indicated he feels  overwhelmed by the worldwide attention he's getting.
That attention continues to carry beyond the court. Although  Lin played one game for the Erie BayHawks when the  Knicks sent him  to their D-League affiliate,  he continues to make money for the Pennsylvania team.
The team placed three Lin-worn items on eBay on Saturday, and the bidding has been brisk.
As of 8 p.m. ET Monday, the bids were: $4,000 for the No. 17 jersey Lin wore in his one game, $1,025 for Lin's practice jersey and $750 for a "shooting shirt."
The jersey carries a letter of authenticity from the BayHawks, and some of the proceeds will go to charity, according to the Erie Times-News.

Journey goes on for TSA-seized loot; 
Some states sell or donate items fliers can't carry on, such as fuzzy handcuffs

BYLINE: Bart Jansen, USA TODAY

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 826 words

From samurai swords to hatchets to snow globes, the Transportation Security Administration collects tons of unusual objects each year that passengers try to carry onto planes.
The objects are what the TSA deems weapons or other threats to flight security. They're surrendered at checkpoints by forgetful or harried passengers who would rather give them up than miss a flight or return to the check-in counter and pay extra to put them in a checked bag.
Among the most common: Swiss Army knives or similarly sharp multiuse pocket tools, though the gamut runs to swords or even fuzzy handcuffs that are more for bedroom use than law enforcement. 
And despite cynical suggestions from angry travelers that security officers keep the items for themselves, the TSA turns over the property to state agencies and commercial vendors, which cart it away to sell. Although public auctions yield a fraction of retail prices, dozens of states have found some revenue in the contraband.
"It's kind of amazing what people will try to take on board," says Troy Thompson, spokesman for Pennsylvania's Department of General Services, which takes some of the contraband. "To them (passengers), it's an item that's not threatening, but in these days and times it is threatening."
Pennsylvania collects truckloads of items from airports, including New York City's John F. Kennedy, LaGuardia and Newark Liberty. The state has raised $700,000 from selling them since 2004, Thompson says.
The most sought-after items by buyers are among the most often left behind: pocket knives, scissors and corkscrews, which are typically sold in boxes of 100. Occasionally, machetes, samurai swords and even an African spear are trucked to the state warehouse in Harrisburg, he says.
The passenger shakedown
About 30 states have collected TSA-relinquished property since the agency was created to provide stricter baggage screening after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, according to Scott Pepperman, executive director of the National Association of State Agencies for Surplus Property.
Because the TSA had trouble coping with the accumulation, with 10 tons of contraband piling up at Los Angeles International Airport alone, Pepperman helped negotiate an agreement a decade ago with the federal government  for states  to take possession of the surrendered items.
"It was of no use to TSA. It's of no value to them. The cost and care of storage and handling was exceeding the commercial value of it to them," Pepperman says. "Some (states) put them up on eBay. Some have their own websites. Others have auctions."
Some states, he says, donate useful items to schools, fire departments and charities.
Some items have questionable resale value. Items that crossed Pepperman's path while he worked in the Pennsylvania surplus agency until two years ago included machetes, meat slicers and a box of rocks.
"We collected more fuzzy handcuffs than you would ever see in your life -- boxes and boxes of fuzzy handcuffs," he says.
Despite a policy of not carrying sharp objects onto planes that dates to just after 9/11 and one that limits liquids and gels that dates to 2006, the TSA continues to collect objects that clearly have malevolent possibilities.
This month, a spear gun showed up at Newark, joining assorted hatchets, chains, inert grenades, metal throwing stars and bullet-holding bandoliers.
Al Della Fave, spokesman for the Port Authority Police Department for New York and New Jersey, admired a recent find of decorative daggers from the Middle East in an ornate wooden box that a traveler carried under his arm.
"People think they're good to go -- and they're not," Della Fava says.
More innocent-looking items also are relinquished. Hundreds of snow globes from Disneyland are in the mountain of TSA contraband piled up in Sacramento, says Michael Liang, spokesman for California's Department of General Services.
The liquid in the snow globes makes the souvenirs a forbidden item in carry-on bags on the possibility it could be explosive.
'Not a big moneymaker'
Nobody keeps track of how many tons of relinquished property is handed over or how much states receive in sales annually. Collecting, sorting and selling the odd objects is a chore, and the amount some states make may seem paltry.
This month, California had one of its quarterly auctions and got $9,800 for TSA-confiscated items, Liang says.
"It's not a lot of money, but every bit helps," he says.
In Alabama, the surplus property division at the state Department of Economic and Community Affairs got about 3 tons last year from airports in Alabama and Florida. Sales totaled about $15,000 for the year, says Larry Childers, an agency spokesman.
"It's a net plus for us, but not a big moneymaker," Childers says.
Georgia opted out of collecting the objects in 2008 because it was  too much trouble, says Steve Ekin, the surplus program manager for the Department of Administrative Services.
"It was a lot of work for very little return," Ekin says.

East Coast earthquake was 'teachable moment'; 
Rare jostling moves region to rethink drills, safety codes

BYLINE: Chuck Raasch, USA TODAY

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

Six months after an earthquake shook the East Coast, its lessons still reverberate through the emergency management, engineering and geological communities.
The magnitude-5.8 quake, centered in the tiny town of Mineral, Va., demonstrated that  earthquakes aren't just a West Coast threat. Big quakes had hit the East Coast  before, but not recently, nor with the frequency or ferocity of those in California.
The Aug. 23 quake was felt by more people than any other in American history, said Marcia McNutt, director of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). Her agency estimates that one-third of the U.S. population -- in 3,400 ZIP codes from Georgia to New York -- felt the quake. 
The Virginia quake caused no deaths but left hundreds of millions of dollars in  damage.  Washington, D.C., 85 miles from the epicenter, took major hits in two of its most prominent landmarks -- the Washington Monument and the Washington National Cathedral, which combined could cost $40 million to repair. The monument is likely to remain closed for up to a year for repairs.
"We were lucky that earthquake struck far from very populated areas," McNutt said Wednesday, also the one-year anniversary of a quake that killed 185 people and devastated the city of Christchurch, New Zealand.
Geologists in McNutt's agency and from universities descended on the East Coast earthquake zone last August to measure aftershocks. Putting to use everything from airplanes shooting  lasers to geologists digging holes, they are mapping a previously unknown fault line beneath the Earth's crust. The agency's data show the fault line running from central Virginia generally toward the northeast and southwest. "It is now possible to say, 'Eureka, we have found the perpetrator,'" McNutt said.
Geologists have discovered that the northeasterly direction of the shock waves and the ground in the Washington, D.C., region -- sediment atop swamps and riverbeds -- contributed to damage far from the epicenter.
Rob Williams, a USGS geophysicist,  said engineers may see the Virginia earthquake "as a wake-up call for all the beautiful buildings that were built 200 years ago in the East without concern for seismic shaking."
James Cagley, chairman of the Maryland-based Cagley & Associates structural engineering firm, said the quake did not elevate his concern about earthquake threats in the eastern U.S., and he said buildings constructed since the 1990s have been made more earthquake-resistant.
Other experts say the Aug. 23 shake will cause designers and building code officials to pay more attention to Eastern quake threats.
Schools were among the most heavily damaged buildings in the Virginia-centered earthquake, said Steven McCabe, deputy director of the Commerce Department's National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program. Damage to schools in California in the 1930s prompted more stringent earthquake-protection codes in that state, he said.
Russell Green, a Virginia Tech civil engineering professor, predicted that the earthquake will cause engineers to design buildings in the East to absorb more ground motion than previously anticipated. Green  and others at Virginia Tech are finishing a national study of the East Coast quake.
James Martin, an environmental engineering professor who is directing the Virginia Tech study, said the earthquake was a "teachable moment" for scientists and the public.
Among his study's preliminary findings: "Areas such as Washington, D.C., are unprepared to deal with even a moderate earthquake, particularly with respect to communications, evacuation and transportation."
The study's draft recommends teaching "earthquake basics" to East Coast schoolchildren.
McNutt said her agency wants to expand the annual "Great Central U.S. Shakeout" to the East Coast. The Shakeout is an annual earthquake drill designed to prepare people in the central USA. Last month, some 2.4 million people in nine states stretching from Illinois to Alabama participated. It came on the 200th anniversary of a Feb. 7, 1812, Missouri quake that was so intense it rang East Coast church bells.
Virginia's annual emergency management symposium next month will focus heavily on earthquake preparedness. Among the speakers will be Rob Dudgeon, San Francisco's deputy director of emergency management.
He will emphasize the difference between  hurricanes, which come after days of warnings and often require mass evacuations, and earthquakes. It is often better for people to stay put after a quake, Dudgeon said.
People in cities after the Aug. 23 quake often did the opposite, evacuating buildings and driving home rather than seeking structurally safe locations indoors and leaving the roads to emergency response vehicles.
"Earthquakes are not fire drills," McNutt said. "What you don't want to do when facades are falling off buildings is file out of the buildings." That's the kind of information that East Coast residents need to hear, said Ed McDonough of the Maryland Emergency Management Agency, which is planning its first earthquake response drill in April.

7 dead in protests of Quran burning; 
Afghan security forces clash with demonstrators

BYLINE: The Associated Press

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 2A

LENGTH: 383 words

Clashes between Afghan troops and protesters angry over the accidental burning of Muslim holy books at a U.S. military base left at least seven people dead and dozens wounded Wednesday. 
Demonstrations about the burning happened in eastern provinces and in Kabul, where hundreds of people massed outside a heavily guarded housing complex for foreigners, chanting "Death to America!" The complex houses foreign contractors, police and some coalition military forces.
The unrest started Tuesday when Afghan workers at the main U.S. military base, Bagram Airfield, saw soldiers dumping books in a pit where garbage is burned and noticed Qurans and other religious material among the trash.
The top U.S. and NATO commander, Marine Gen. John Allen, quickly apologized and called President Hamid Karzai to explain that religious materials, including Qurans, had been mistakenly sent to be incinerated. As soon as someone realized what they were burning, they stopped and retrieved what was left, Allen said. Four Qurans were burned before the incineration was halted, according to initial Afghan government reports.
The protests prompted the U.S. to lock down its embassy and bar its staff from traveling. By nightfall, seven people had been killed -- four in Parwan province and one each in Kabul, Jalalabad and Logar province -- and dozens were wounded, the Interior Ministry said. In some cases, security guards or police were accused of shooting protesters, while in others, officials said, the protesters started the shooting.
The country's council of Muslim clerics called the U.S. apologies  insufficient and said military officials should punish those responsible.
Karzai called on Afghans to stay calm. "The people have the right to protest peacefully, but I appeal to my countrymen not to resort to violence," he said in a statement. He urged Afghan security forces to protect protesters, not fight them.
German Brig. Gen. Carsten Jacobson said the international coalition will issue a "very clear statement" of what happened and those responsible will be held accountable.
U.S. officials said the materials had been taken from the shelves of a detention center library because they contained extremist messages or inscriptions. The White House said it was an accident that they were sent to be burned.

A window on Syria's bloodbath; 
Elaborate networks ensure that desperate stories reach the world

BYLINE: Jabeen Bhatti and Portia Walker, Special for USA TODAY

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 1A

LENGTH: 1666 words

In a secret studio jammed with video monitors, Syrian activists and journalists scan live cellphone-camera feeds of protests against Syrian dictator Bashar Assad and, in many cases, images of unmistakable atrocities and unimaginable human suffering.
Working quickly, they transmit the videos via satellite link to the Internet, where the scenes of destruction that the Assad regime is trying to conceal are revealed in full color to the world.
Lacking heavy weapons and pounded by Assad's tank shells, the revolutionaries and citizen-journalists in and around Syria hope  their battle to spread information will save their fellow citizens from slaughter and prompt international intervention.
"Shooting videos is more punishable than carrying a weapon because video is the weapon of the protesters," says Anas, a volunteer at the Shaam News Network who asked that his full name not be used to protect his safety and that of family in Syria. 
Weeks of indiscriminate artillery barrages on rebellious cities have yet to defeat anti-Assad forces made up of citizens and former soldiers.
Hundreds have died in Homs alone in the past several days, including Syrian activists and Western journalists, the latest a veteran American war correspondent working for a British newspaper and a French photographer.
"I watched a little baby die today," journalist Marie Colvin told the BBC  from the rebel stronghold of Homs just hours before she was killed during the shelling of a home where she had taken refuge. "Absolutely horrific."
Wissam Tarif, a spokesman for Avaaz, a humanitarian organization in Beirut, says seven male activists were found Wednesday in Homs shot in the head with their hands tied behind their backs.
The ongoing siege -- making targets of civilians -- reflects the hardened defiance of the Assad regime, and it comes almost a year into the Syrian rebellion that sprung to life in the midst of the Arab Spring. Assad, who came to power in 2000, has seen Egypt's Hosni Mubarak's ouster (and now, trial) as well as the collapse and killing of Libya's Moammar Gadhafi.
Since the Syrian uprising began, more than 5,400 people have been killed, according to the United Nations. And untold numbers have been wounded. This past week, Red Cross officials pleaded for a cease-fire on humanitarian grounds. Instead, the bombardment of Homs has intensified since the beginning of February.
No food, no water, no medicine
Residents have been reporting their daily horrors to the outside world any way they can. Waleed, who asked that only his first name be used to prevent the Syrian army from tracking him down, said in a feed through Skype that life in Homs has become desperate.
"Electricity has been cut off in most neighborhoods, and we have only seen bread twice in the last 10 days," he said as shells could be heard in the background. "There is no water, so people are drinking from dirty wells. There is no medicine. The hospitals are all run by the military, and wounded people sometimes bleed to death. Pregnant women who need surgery die."
Even getting about to obtain basic needs has become an impossibility, Waleed says: "We can't leave our neighborhood because there are snipers on every corner."
Sanctions, repeated denunciations by the Arab League and diplomatic isolation have had no effect on Assad or the people resisting him. Several cities in Syria are in open rebellion, and protests have emerged in the major merchant city of Aleppo and the capital of Damascus.
As Assad's opponents continue to fight, a legion of civilians outside Syria are pressing for help from the West and the Arab world. Their weapon: images and reports from the war zone. Many -- citizens and professional journalists -- pay with their lives. Reporters Without Borders said that after Wednesday's killings, a total of nine journalists have died in Syria.
Colvin, 56, who was working for Britain's Sunday Times, and photojournalist Remi Ochlik, 28, were sharing accommodations with activists in Homs when their building was struck by artillery. Some believe that Syrian forces targeted the makeshift media center.
"The house was known as a media hub," Tarif says.  "Random shelling doesn't happen this way. This house was repeatedly targeted and hit 11 times."
More than 70 people  were killed nationwide Wednesday as Assad's regime also escalated attacks on rebel bases elsewhere, activists said. Helicopter gunships strafed mountain villages that shelter the rebel Free Syrian Army, and soldiers staged door-to-door raids in Damascus, among other attacks, according to the Local Coordination Committee, a group of activists who have been relaying information from Syrians in besieged cities to the international media.
Details of the violence are impossible to verify because the Assad regime has barred foreign journalists from the rebellious areas, though some slip in -- undercover and at great risk to themselves.
Assad has maintained that the opposition movement is made up of thugs and troublemakers. This week, the Syrian government denied killing civilians and said "armed terrorist groups" were attacking cities, according to the state news agency SANA.
The U.S. reaction: Not ruling out aid
The Obama administration, reacting to the latest violence and deaths of the journalists, said Wednesday it hoped for a political solution but that military assistance to the anti-Assad forces was not out of the question. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton was traveling to Tunisia for a meeting Friday of more than 70 nations to look for ways to assist Assad's opposition.
"We don't want to take actions that would contribute to the further militarization of Syria because that could take the country down a dangerous path," White House press secretary Jay Carney says. "But we don't rule out additional measures if the international community should wait too long and not take the kind of action that needs to be taken."
Critics of administration policy, such as Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., have asked why President Obama acted to aid in the ouster of Gadhafi but not Assad. The president initially resisted pleas inside and outside the administration to assist Libyan rebels last year, but eventually signed on to a limited U.S. military assistance under the auspices of NATO. There is no indication that such aid to Syria is imminent. Complicating any international response is Russia and China's resistance to challenging Assad at the U.N. Security Council.
James Dobbins, a RAND Corp. analyst and former diplomat, says it appears the West might be heading toward a sort of Libya-type solution. He said Western military intervention would only come if the Syrian opposition unified, the Arab League endorsed a request for foreign intervention and a nation other than the United States played the leading role.
"Once again, you'd have the United States leading from behind, which in this case is not only the safest place but also the wisest," Dobbins says.
The United States should send a covert team into Syria to assess the rebels and what they need and start working on training, doctrine and building a chain of command, says Tony Badran, a researcher at the Foundation for  Defense of Democracies. "In terms of weapons and finance, they're already getting it.  The idea that the administration keeps holding onto  a peaceful resolution, or peaceful transition, is unrealistic," he says. "One side has to win."
Thirty years ago, one side did win. Assad's father, Hafez Assad, killed an estimated 10,000 to 40,000 people to put down a rebellion. Unlike 1982, today's events are being broadcast to the world by Syrians working in and outside the country via cellphone videos, social media and satellite communications. They depict shattered and smoldering city blocks, and in some cases Syrian soldiers laughing and sharing cigarettes with piled bodies at their feet, according to Human Rights Watch.
Badran says the atmosphere surrounding the 1982 assault was far different. Hafez Assad "was able to go in and crush them, and it took several weeks for anyone to hear the story or learn of the story," Badran says. "This has been televised from Day One."
Anas, the news network volunteer, says they are using technology to put a global spotlight on Syria's actions this time.
"It has helped people inside (Syria) as well, more with motivation -- when people see their videos on the Facebook page and thousands of people are watching them, it motivates them to go out the next day," Anas says. "Because now, people are hearing us and seeing us."
As demonstrations spread across the country throughout last year, ordinary people gave up their jobs and committed themselves to telling the world what was happening in Syria. Businessmen, pilot, teachers and engineers became citizen journalists, putting their lives in danger on daily basis. People remembered what happened three decades ago.
"The main goal was informing people outside Syria," Anas said.  "The digital age helped people gain confidence that they can make a change."
A husband slain, she returns to help
Just over the Syrian border in Tripoli, Lebanon, Um Salim says she is looking for someone to care for her young son so she could return to Homs. Ten months ago, her husband, Muhaned, was killed in the strife-torn city. Now she is training as a nurse so she can return and tend to the injured.
The smiling young woman wears a white headscarf and hides her face with a scarf when photographed. She says she'll be done training within two months and isn't afraid to return. There's a clinic where she can leave her son, Salim, who is nearly 3.
"My life is not important compared to their lives. They are asking for people there," she says, when asked if she feared returning to the city.  "We are Syrians. We are brothers. We have to help each other."

Judge: Plan B pill is not the rule in Wash.

BYLINE: John Bacon with staff and wire reports

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 615 words

Washington state may not force pharmacies to sell Plan B or other emergency contraceptives, a federal judge ruled Wednesday.
Judge Ronald Leighton said the state's goal was to suppress religious objections by druggists -- not to promote timely access to the medicines.
Leighton heard closing arguments  this month in a lawsuit that claimed the state requirement violates the constitutional rights of pharmacists. The state requires pharmacies to dispense any medication for which there is a community need. Leighton said the state allows other exemptions to that rule, such as not stocking certain drugs that can lead to theft. Ralph's Thriftway in Olympia, Wash., and two licensed Washington pharmacists filed the suit in 2007. 
Newark leaders blast NYPD spy effort
The mayor and police director of New Jersey's largest city said the New York Police Department never told them it was conducting widespread spying in Newark's Muslim neighborhoods.
Newark Mayor Cory Booker and Police Director Samuel DeMaio said they never would have allowed the spying. In mid-2007, the NYPD's secretive Demographics Unit fanned out across Newark, photographing every mosque and eavesdropping on Muslim businesses.
The findings were cataloged in a 60-page report, though there was no mention of terrorism or criminal wrongdoing.
New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg defended the NYPD, saying its  job is to investigate allegations and protect the public: "Remind yourself when you turn out the light tonight."
Occupy group sets national convention
A group of protesters affiliated with the Occupy Wall Street movement said it plans to elect 876 delegates from across the USA and hold a national "general assembly" in Philadelphia over the Fourth of July holiday as part of ongoing protests over corporate excess and economic inequality.
The 99% Declaration Working Group said an online election will be held in June to select delegates. The group plans to draft and ratify a "petition for a redress of grievances," and will hold a news conference in front of Independence Hall on the Fourth of July. "Following the footsteps of our Founding Fathers is the right way to go," group adviser Michael Pollok said.
Mine official charged in 2010 tragedy
The superintendent of the West Virginia coal mine where an explosion killed 29 men in 2010 was charged Wednesday with conspiracy to defraud the federal government.
Former Upper Big Branch mine boss Gary May, 43, is the second employee of Massey Energy, the company that owned the mine at the time, to face prosecution. U.S. Attorney Booth Goodwin said his investigation  is "absolutely not" finished, signaling that officials are now exploring possible charges against even higher-level executives.
Solyndra employees to get bonuses
A Delaware bankruptcy court judge approved nearly $370,000 in bonuses  for employees of the bankrupt solar-panel manufacturer Solyndra.
Solyndra, which received a $535million taxpayer-backed loan guarantee, initially sought to give  about $500,000 in bonuses to 21 employees but later agreed to scale back the request.
Judge Mary Walrath overruled objections from Solyndra's laid-off workers, who opposed the bonuses. Solyndra argued the bonuses are necessary to retain essential employees as the company sells off its assets.--Aamer Madhani
Third-grader held in school shooting
An 8-year-old girl was in critical condition  after she was shot in the abdomen at Armin Jahr Elementary  near Seattle, and one of her classmates was detained, authorities said.
Bremerton police Lt. Peter Fisher said a third-grade boy was in  custody and  being questioned, and a firearm was found in a classroom. The school went into lockdown but will reopen today.

55 die in string of attacks targeting Iraqi police

BYLINE: Robert Bianco, USA TODAY

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 10A

LENGTH: 442 words

A series of attacks spread over a wide swath of Iraq killed at least 55 people on Thursday, targeting mostly security forces in what Iraqi officials called "frantic attempts" by insurgents to show civilians that their country was doomed. 
The bombings and shootings unfolded over hours in the capital of Baghdad -- where most of the deaths occurred -- and 11 other cities. They struck government offices, restaurants and one in the town of Musayyib hit close to a primary school.
"What is happening today are not simple security violations -- it is a huge security failure and disaster," said Ahmed al-Tamimi, who works near a restaurant that was bombed in Baghdad.
It was the latest of a series of large-scale attacks that insurgents have launched every few weeks since the last U.S. troops left Iraq in December at the end of a nearly 9-year-old war. The Interior Ministry blamed al-Qaeda terrorists for the violence.
"These attacks are part of frantic attempts by the terrorist groups to show that the security situation in Iraq will not ever be stable," the ministry said in a statement. "These attacks are part of al-Qaeda efforts to deliver a message to its supporters that al-Qaeda is still operating inside Iraq, and it has the ability to launch strikes inside the capital or other cities and towns."
The violence points to a dangerous gap in the abilities of the Iraqi security forces that had particularly worried the departing U.S. military: their ability to gather intelligence on insurgent groups and stop them before they launch attacks. Gathering information on militants and their networks was a key area in which the U.S. military helped their Iraqi counterparts.
Shortly after the withdrawal, a major political crisis with sectarian undertones erupted  when Shiite-dominated authorities sought to arrest Sunni Vice President Tariq al-Hashemi on allegations that he commandeered death squads targeting security forces and government officials. The fear has been that these renewed sectarian tensions may push Iraq back to the violence it saw during the height of the insurgency in 2006 and 2007.
Nationwide, security forces appeared to be targeted in at least 14 separate attacks, including a drive-by shooting in Baghdad that killed six policemen at a checkpoint before dawn. Police patrols in the capital and beyond  were besieged by roadside bombs.
In the single-deadliest strike, a car bomb in Baghdad's downtown shopping district of Karradah killed nine people and wounded 26. In Musayyib, a car bomb parked between a restaurant and an elementary school killed three people and wounded 75. Most of the injured were schoolchildren, police said.

Stability starts to take root in Kandahar province; 
U.S. forces try to ensure Taliban won't be able to reverse progress

BYLINE: Carmen Gentile

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 8A

LENGTH: 1062 words

Sgt. Robert LaPointe shakes his head  as he recalls the dangers he and his fellow soldiers faced during the first month of their deployment to Kandahar province, a particularly hostile region of southern Afghanistan.
Day and night, they patrolled rows of grape vines and poppy fields on foot and slept in the open where Taliban gunmen lurked. Firefights and buried bombs killed seven of LaPointe's fellow soldiers and injured dozens more.
"I don't think we accomplished anything the first month here," he says. 
Pvt. 1st Class Kerry Pinkstaff agrees.
"When you went out there, you would get shot at and blown up," Pinkstaff says. "You couldn't find them. They'd pop up, then be gone, like ghosts."
U.S. military leaders in the Zharai district responded with a new strategy. They ended the foot patrols on the roads and narrow paths where vast farmlands are flanked by steep, jagged mountains. They established small "strong points," heavily fortified guard posts made of earth and sandbags. They called in airstrikes and helicopter gun runs on Taliban positions.
"It was a rough summer," Lt. David Tuttle says. "We took the gloves off ... and that allowed us to build the community back."
Today, the villagers in the region are able to go about their lives without fear of the Taliban, the harsh Islamist regime ousted by the U.S.-led invasion in 2001. Though the Taliban is weakened as a military force and must subsist in remote areas, tribal leaders and U.S. troops agree it hasn't gone and the members who remain want their onetime realm back.
"The level of commitment by the insurgency is surprising," says Lt. Col. Kenneth Mintz, battalion commander.
Self-sufficiency goals
The mission of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), the coalition of U.S. and foreign forces fighting in Afghanistan, is to neutralize the Taliban and turn over the security of the country to the Afghans themselves. Just when the Afghans can handle their own security has been the question.
The Pentagon says much of the south is largely under coalition control and forces will have to be shifted to the border with Pakistan, where Taliban forces and the Haqqani netwok of jihadists are a major threat.
NATO agreed in 2010 that the transition from foreign forces to Afghan forces should take place by the end of 2014, provided conditions on the ground warranted the move. Last month, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta suggested the transition may arrive earlier, in late 2013.
"If the U.S. withdraws from Afghanistan while the Haqqanis still have such safe havens, the mission President Obama set himself of disrupting and defeating al-Qaeda in Afghanistan and creating conditions that will prevent it from returning will have failed," says Frederick W. Kagan, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute who advised the Bush administration on the successful troop surge in Iraq.
Capt. Widmar Roman and the soldiers of the 10th Mountain, 3rd Brigade, 32nd Infantry Regiment are among those who have forced the Taliban out of Kandahar population centers. With its fortified positions and razor wire lining the road, the area little resembles its previous incarnation, and it's more secure.
The area was home to Taliban leader Mohammed Omar, who may be in Pakistan.
"The amount of security down here is unparalleled compared to what people have seen in the past," Roman says.
Roman  says the change in strategy allowed troops enough breathing room to interact with local leaders in ways previously impossible.
Among the interactions is the shoring up of the Afghan Local Police (ALP), an initiative pushed by Gen. David Petraeus, former ISAF commander, to train and arm  Afghan men willing to keep the Taliban out of their villages.
Mintz acknowledges that the Taliban is still bringing insurgents to the area to replace those  killed or captured over the last year, but he says the seeds of stability and security have taken root among the locals.
Several village elders helped U.S. forces root out the Taliban and recruit men into the ranks of the police who work with the Afghan National Army here to maintain security.
"It used to be that we couldn't travel from one village to the other because of the Taliban," says Shah Wali Khan, who lost his left leg to an insurgent mine a few months ago.
"Now we can travel all the way to Kandahar (city). God willing, we will be able to maintain security when the Americans leave," says Khan, stroking his thick beard as his followers nod in agreement and children play near a store once used as Taliban headquarters.
Negotiations
In a meeting called by Roman, two dozen Afghan men and members of the ALP raised concerns about the compensation they were promised by American forces for cutting a road through several fields, the destruction of homes during firefights and raids and buildings taken over for strong points.
"Condolence payments" amount to about $2,500, Roman says. He told the men they would get their money after they appointed someone from their ranks to represent Nalgham at the district government level.
Fears remain that any appointed leader would be murdered by Taliban fighters based a few miles to the west  who regularly engage U.S. and Afghan forces on patrols.
"We don't want to put anyone else in danger," yelled Gul Mohammed, one of the men at the meeting, which ended with neither Afghans receiving compensation for their losses nor Roman getting a representative for Nalgham.
The captain says the discussion was a normal part of the negotiating process, and he is optimistic that both sides will reach a compromise.
Afghan Brig. Gen. Guhlam Murtaza Sarwary says his soldiers and U.S. troops have convinced Nalgham they will remain in the area for the long haul, even after U.S. forces leave.
"Nalgham was one of those damaged and dangerous places last year," Murtaza says. "Now, the people no longer fear the enemy like they once had."
This time of year is ideal for talk, Roman says. The cold winter months are when many Taliban fighters return to Pakistan and attacks on U.S. and Afghan forces decrease. In a few weeks, it will be time for action when the warm weather approaches, signaling the start to the fighting season.
Then the Americans may be able to tell how close the Afghans are to being able to defend themselves. "We'll really be able to see the difference once it starts warming up again next summer," Roman says.

Team USA to take on Spain, Argentina

LENGTH: 465 words

Team USA  is expected to play five exhibition games before the London Olympics, including high-profile  matchups against Brazil, Spain and Argentina, according to a person familiar with the schedule  who was not authorized to speak publicly until the announcement is official today. 
The Americans will play two exhibition games at home  -  against the Dominican Republic in Las Vegas at the conclusion of  training camp and  against Brazil in Washington, D.C., before the team departs for Europe.
The U.S. team also will play Britain in Manchester, England, and Spain and Argentina in Spain. The Olympics will be held July 27-Aug.12.
USA Basketball chairman Jerry Colangelo will announce the schedule today at a news conference in Orlando. Memphis Grizzlies center  Marc Gasol, a Spaniard, and Jose Luis Saez, Spain's national team president,  will attend.
It is an ambitious schedule for the USA, similar to a college coach playing tough opponents in the non-conference season in preparation for  conference play  and the NCAA tournament.
Brazil, Spain and Argentina are among the best teams in the world, and Team USA could face them in the elimination round in London. Brazil finished second to Argentina, which won the 2004  Olympic gold medal, in the 2011 FIBA Americas Championship final. Spain, which finished second to the USA in the 2008 Beijing Olympics, is the 2011 FIBA Europe champion.
Rookie makes impression: Isaiah Thomas was the last player chosen in the 2011  draft at No.60. Now the 5-9 point guard is in the starting lineup for the Sacramento Kings, pushing aside fellow rookie Jimmer Fredette for playing time.
Thomas has played in all 32 games for the Kings but  has started only the last four.  As a starter, he is averaging 19.5 points and 6.5 assists, compared with 8.8 points and 2.9 assists for the season.
The Kings are 1-3 with him in the starting lineup but have been competitive in each game.
"I'm living a dream right now, each and every day," Thomas said. "Go out and work the hardest. You're already short, so that's the hardest battle."
Shooting guard Marcus Thornton would like Thomas to get attention, too.
"All this Jeremy Lin talk, there needs to be some Isaiah talk," Thornton said.
Curry opts out of Skills Challenge: Golden State Warriors point guard Stephen Curry pulled out of All-Star Weekend activities because of a sore right foot.
He was scheduled to participate in Saturday's Skills Challenge, in which he's the defending champion. He injured the foot in Wednesday's victory against the Phoenix Suns.
Lance Young, Curry's agent, said the decision was a precautionary measure. A strained tendon in Curry's foot isn't related to his right ankle injury, Young said.
Curry's withdrawal did not come in time to be noted in today's USA TODAY All-Star Bonus Section.

Thunder, Bulls chase Heat; 
About midway through the lockout-shortened, 66-game NBA regular season, USA TODAY rates the 30 teams in our latest power rankings:

BYLINE: J. Michael Falgoust and Jeff Zillgitt

SECTION: BONUS; Pg. 7E

LENGTH: 938 words

1. Miami Heat:  They have the NBA's top record, and F LeBron James is playing like an MVP on both ends of the floor.
2. Oklahoma City Thunder: With the Thunder plowing  through the West, their  season will be judged on their playoff performance.
3. Chicago Bulls: They haven't missed a beat despite PG Derrick Rose missing time with a sore back and SG Rip Hamilton out since Jan. 28 with leg injuries. 
4. San Antonio Spurs: Even without SG Manu Ginobili (broken hand, stomach muscle injury) for much of the season, the  "aging" Spurs have been the hottest team of late.  PF Tim Duncan, 35, has six double-doubles this month.
5. Dallas Mavericks: Coach Rick Carlisle appears to have figured out his rotations, with six players on the roster not there during the  championship run. And they are top five in  scoring defense.
6. Los Angeles Clippers: The season-ending loss of G Chauncey Billups (torn Achilles tendon)  has hurt the guard rotation, but PF Kenyon Martin has stabilized them inside with his rebounding, toughness and defensive awareness.
7. Orlando Magic: After  ending January  losing six of  eight, they are back on target with C Dwight Howard on fire, G Jameer Nelson healthy again after post-concussion symptoms and F Ryan Anderson shooting lights out and committing to better defense.
8. Philadelphia 76ers: Coach Doug Collins constantly is trying to get the most out of his deep team, which is not playing its best heading into the break.
9. Los Angeles Lakers: Coach Mike Brown insists they're getting  playoff defense, but the offense is way behind.  PF Pau Gasol wondering if he's  on the trading block doesn't help.
10. Indiana Pacers: They have bounced back from a season-long, five-game losing streak.  All-Star C Roy Hibbert keeps getting better, scoring a career-high 30 vs. New Orleans on Tuesday.
11. Houston Rockets: PG Kyle Lowry is playing well enough to be an All-Star, and PF Luis Scola and SG Kevin Martin have not allowed the team's failed preseason trade of them that was nixed by the league to affect their performances.
12. Atlanta Hawks:  The loss of C Al Horford is finally catching up to them, and now SG Joe Johnson has a  left knee injury.
13. Memphis Grizzlies: F Marreese Speights has filled in well for injured F Zach Randolph, averaging 14.4 points in the last five games.  Memphis won four of those  and has a top-10 scoring defense.
14. New York Knicks: How coach Mike D'Antoni fits together all of the players in the wake of the Jeremy Lin phenomenon will decide their season.
15. Denver Nuggets: The loss of SF Danilo Gallinari (chip fracture in ankle) has been significant, and PF Nene has  a sore left Achilles that keeps him out  occasionally.
16. Portland Trail Blazers: PG Ray Felton has been ineffective and moved to the bench in favor of Jamal Crawford, a career starting guard, to rev up the offense. SF Nicolas Batum started the season inconsistent on offense but is averaging 18.6 points this month.
17. Boston Celtics:  Coach Doc Rivers' lineups constantly are changing because of injuries, which makes the Celtics hard to gauge. When the starters are back together, they still can be dangerous.
18. Minnesota Timberwolves: The Kevin Love-Ricky Rubio connection continues to strengthen, but there is concern for  C Nikola Pekovic (spraned right ankle), who has filled in admirably for  Darko Milicic (bruised left thigh)  and could remain the starter.
19. Utah Jazz:  The play of PG Devin Harris hasn't been adequate, so  rookie G Alec Burks is starting to get more consistent minutes.
20. Cleveland Cavaliers: PG Kyrie Irving has energized this franchise, which likely will surpass last season's 19  wins in a shortened schedule.
21. Milwaukee Bucks:  The Bucks aren't closing out games, including three they have dropped to the Magic with  fourth-quarter leads of 10, 10 and five points.
22. Phoenix Suns: Coach Alvin Gentry recently rested PG Steve Nash, 38, and SF Grant Hill, 39, because they're "run down" -- with another half season to go.
23. Golden State Warriors: Two of  the losses the past week were  by a total of three points.  Bench depth has improved with G Nate Robinson, F Ekpe Udoh, G Brandon Rush and G Klay Thompson.
24. Detroit Pistons: February has been their strongest month, with  SG Rodney Stuckey now  in the starting lineup and playing well in tandem  with rookie PG Brandon Knight.
25. New Jersey Nets: Their win against the Knicks this week was more remarkable given the lack of post play without  C Brook Lopez, who should be returning soon from a foot injury. The Nets will live or die by the three-point shot.
26. Sacramento Kings:  Despite the losing, there is a spark in rookie PG Isaiah Thomas, who had games of 23 and 24 points in the past week.  Playing time for rookie G Jimmer Fredette has dropped.
27. Toronto Raptors: Andrea Bargnani's absence (strained left calf), after the center's outstanding start, crushed the Raptors' hopes of improving the way new coach Dwane Casey and President Bryan Colangelo envisioned.
28. New Orleans Hornets: They simply lack the bodies to compete. SG Eric Gordon had to have a right knee procedure and is out for at least another six weeks, and C Emeka Okafor and PF Jason Smith are injured. Rookie PF-C Gustavo Ayon, with two double-doubles last week, is one of the few bright spots.
29. Washington Wizards: Opponents have scored at least 100 points in all but one of the first 11 games this month.  The Wizards have the second-worst point differential in the league.
30. Charlotte Bobcats: With or without PG D.J. Augustin, this is the consensus worst team, with the fewest points scored and the worst point differential.

Midmajors could cause some major upheaval

BYLINE: Steve Berkowitz

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 3C

LENGTH: 408 words

A year after Virginia Commonwealth went from the NCAA men's basketball tournament at-large play-in game to the Final Four, it's hard to be suspect of any team hovering around tournament contention. 
But when some projections of the NCAA tournament field now include three teams from the Pac-12 Conference, Saint Joseph's (19-11) and Northwestern (17-11), it's hard not to be suspect of any team not contending for a No. 1 or No. 2 seed.
Which brings us to this week's start of conference tournament play and some mid- and low-major teams that need to be rooted for by the Northwesterns of the world and against by any major-conference team looking at a single-digit seed.
If Murray State doesn't win the Ohio Valley tournament, that's going be one fewer  at-large spot for a major-conference team. If Loyola Marymount, which has won at Saint Mary's and Brigham Young, takes the West Coast title, the WCC likely will get four bids (Gonzaga is in good shape, even though Saint Mary's ended its run of 11 consecutive regular-season conference titles).
Wichita State and Creighton separated themselves from the rest of the Missouri Valley in the regular-season standings, but the conference tournament's third seed, Evansville, has a win and an overtime loss against Creighton and losses by one and 12 against Wichita State. If Drexel and VCU reach the Colonial tournament final, they'll  have excellent at-large prospects.
At the other end of the spectrum are a set of teams that almost surely will not make the NCAA tournament without winning their conference tournaments but could be trendy upset picks if they do make it. Iona (Metro Atlantic) has the nation's assist leader, Scott Machado; Arizona transfer Lamont "MoMo" Jones; and 6-7, 215-pound forward Mike Glover, who averages 18 points and nine rebounds a game.
Davidson (Southern) has beaten Kansas in Kansas City, Mo. The Wildcats have three regulars shooting at least 39% from three-point range, and, as a team, they're making 77% of their free throws. Oral Roberts (Summit) has lost once since Dec. 15, and to win the conference tournament in Sioux Falls, S.D., it might have to beat second-seeded South Dakota State.
Any of the top five seeds in the Horizon tournament -- in order, Valparaiso, Cleveland State, Detroit, Milwaukee and Butler -- could be a problem in the NCAA tournament, but any could get dumped after a regular season in which seven teams finished with at least 10 league wins.

Sacha Baron Cohen urns notoriety again; 
Hits red carpet as The Dictator

BYLINE: Susan Wloszczyna, USA TODAY

SECTION: LIFE; Pg. 3D

LENGTH: 394 words

All the hoopla was worth it.
Not the annual circus of the stars known as the Oscars, but all the fuss  over yet another successful publicity stunt  by British comic provocateur Sacha Baron Cohen. 
He was invited to attend the ceremony as a member of the cast of Hugo until last week, when it was learned he planned to appear in the guise of the title character of his upcoming farce The Dictator.
But the academy ban was lifted on Friday, and Cohen was free to roam the red carpet as Admiral General Shabazz Aladeen,  leader of the fictional Republic of Wadiya. Wearing fancy military dress  and escorting two pouty ladies in burgundy berets,  the ZZ-Top-bearded foe of democratic principles  zeroed in on his target: E! red-carpet chatmeister  Ryan Seacrest.
Seacrest asked Aladeen  who he was wearing. "I'm wearing John Galliano," he said in a faux accent, "but the socks are from Kmart. As Saddam Hussein once said to me, 'Socks are socks. Don't waste money.'"
Then Aladeen revealed what was in the golden urn he was toting -- the supposed ashes of late North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il. As he explained, "It was his dream to come to the Oscars and be sprinkled over the red carpet and over Halle Berry's chest again."
Instead, Seacrest was literally left in the dust, his tuxedo covered with ashes. A classic Tumblr moment was born. Guards  swooped in to escort Aladeen away, but not before he got in one more dig at the "victim of comedy," as Tina Fey later dubbed Seacrest: "If somebody asks what you are wearing, you will say, 'Kim Jong-Il.'"
It was the climax of a weeklong PR gag pulled by Cohen, known for such ribald alter egos as Kazakh mockumentarian Borat and Austrian fashionista  Bruno. Perhaps Aladeen's plea ("While I applaud the academy for taking away my rights to free speech, I am outraged at being banned from the Oscars!") on the Today show Friday morning caused the academy to change its mind later that afternoon.
He sent out a victory tweet, complete with a photo showing Aladeen holding Oscar tickets in one hand and a gun in the other, proclaiming: "Today the Mighty Nation of Wadiya triumphed over the Zionist snakes of Hollywood."
But he apparently wasn't quite so confrontational at cocktail time: Cohen looked much more dignified, back in his standard tuxedo, standing at the theater bar a bit later in the evening.

Violence escalates after Quran burnings; 
Afghan anger, attacks rage on despite apologies

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 7A

LENGTH: 512 words

A suicide car bomber struck early today  at the gates of Jalalabad airport in eastern Afghanistan, killing nine people in a large blast, officials said.
The Taliban said the attack on the airport, which serves both civilian and international military aircraft, was revenge for the burning of Muslim holy books at an American military base. 
The attack comes after demonstrators on Sunday hurled grenades at a U.S. base in northern Afghanistan, and a gunbattle left two Afghans dead and seven NATO troops injured  in the escalating crisis over the burning of the Qurans.
More than 30 people have been killed, including four U.S. servicemembers, in nearly a week  of unrest. Still, the top U.S. diplomat in Afghanistan said the violence would not change Washington's course.
"Tensions are running very high here, and I think we need to let things calm down, return to a more normal atmosphere, and then get on with business," Ambassador Ryan Crocker told CNN's State of the Union. "This is not the time to decide that we're done here," he said. "We have got to redouble our efforts. We've got to create a situation in which al-Qaeda is not coming back."
Sunday's  attack on the base came a day after two U.S. military advisers -- a lieutenant colonel and a major -- were found dead after being shot in the head  at the Interior Ministry in Kabul.
The incident prompted NATO, Britain and France to recall hundreds of international advisers from all Afghan ministries in the capital.
A manhunt was underway for the main suspect in that shooting -- an Afghan man who worked as a driver for an office on the same floor as the advisers who were killed, Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqi said.
The Taliban claimed that the shooter was one of their sympathizers and that an accomplice had helped him get into the compound to kill the Americans in retaliation for the Quran burnings.
In today's car bombing, the attacker drove up to the gates of the airport shortly after dawn and detonated his explosives in a "very strong" blast, said Nangarhar provincial police spokesman Hazrad Mohammad. NATO forces spokesman Capt. Justin Brockhoff said no international forces were killed, and the installation was not breached.
Afghanistan's defense and interior ministers were to visit Washington this week, but they called off the trip to consult with other Afghan officials and religious leaders on how to stop the violence, Pentagon spokesman George Little said.
President Obama and other officials apologized for the burnings, which they called an accident.
Last week, during a protest in Nangarhar province,  two other U.S. servicemembers were killed when an Afghan soldier turned his gun on them.
In Sunday's protest in Kunduz, thousands of protesters tried to enter the district's largest city. Armed individuals  fired on police and threw grenades at the U.S. base, said Amanuddin Quriashi, administrator in Imam Sahib.
Seven NATO servicemembers were wounded by the grenade. One protester was killed by troops firing from the U.S. base, and another was killed by Afghan police, Quriashi said.

Quran incident 'tailor-made' for Taliban; 
Militants try to portray burning as part of U.S. campaign against Islam, analysts say

BYLINE: Jim Michaels, USA TODAY

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 6A

LENGTH: 545 words

The Taliban is attempting to capitalize on the outbreak of violence that followed the inadvertent burning of the holy Quran by NATO troops by characterizing the war as a conflict between infidels and Islam, analysts say. 
"It's tailor-made to their argument that the United States is trying to desecrate and destroy Islam," said Seth Jones, an analyst at RAND Corp. and author of In the Graveyard of Empires: America's War in Afghanistan. "It's patently untrue."
Monday, a suicide car bomber launched an attack against the gates of a coalition base in Jalalabad, killing nine Afghans. The Taliban said the attack was revenge for the Quran burning, the Associated Press reported.
Over the weekend, two military advisers were found dead in their office at the Interior Ministry, a highly secure facility in Kabul. In response, NATO withdrew all its advisers from government ministries as Afghan police searched for a suspect in the killings.
The Quran burning threatens to undermine cooperation between Afghan and coalition forces, which is at the heart of the U.S. strategy to withdraw its troops and turn over security to Afghan forces, the analysts say.
"The danger is a potential breakdown in trust between Afghan security forces and (U.S. and coalition) advisers," said David Barno, a retired lieutenant general who commanded coalition forces in Afghanistan and is at the Center for a New American Security.
Historically, Jones said, such crises eventually fade away.
The United States has moved quickly to quell the fallout from the incident. President Obama issued an apology to Afghan President Hamid Karzai.
Marine Gen. John Allen, commander of coalition forces in Afghanistan, said the burning was not intentional and will be investigated. Karzai has urged his countrymen to remain calm.
The White House said it was committed to continuing its plan to reduce U.S. forces in Afghanistan, turning over security responsibility to Afghan forces by the end of 2014.
It's not clear whether the Taliban is directly behind any of the recent violence, but the outbreak works to the Taliban's advantage, Barno said. "They're moving quickly to exploit that."
Some analysts said it will be hard for the Taliban to capitalize on the anger. The militant group remains deeply unpopular in Afghanistan, Jones said. "What we're seeing now is more of a reaction to that specific incident than it is support for Taliban," Jones said.
Jones said U.S. and Afghan officers have forged deep bonds after more than a decade of fighting together against the Taliban and it is not easy to damage that relationship.
The outbreak in violence comes as the U.S. mission in Afghanistan is moving increasingly toward advising and assisting local forces as the United States draws down its combat forces.
The success of that mission will ride largely on the quality of the relationship between NATO and Afghanistan.
Commanders are  working to ensure those bonds remain strong. After two U.S. soldiers were killed by a man wearing an Afghan army uniform last week, Allen traveled to the base  where the shooting was. "There will be moments like this when your emotions are governed by anger and the desire to strike back," Allen told a group of soldiers. "Now is not the time for revenge."

Ohio shooting puts school in chaos; 
Suspect in custody after morning incident that left one dead, four injured

BYLINE: Dennis Cauchon and Greg Toppo, USA TODAY

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 764 words

As they huddled in locked-down classrooms waiting for a nightmarish shooting to end Monday, Chardon High School students did what teenagers everywhere do when they're looking for answers: They texted, tweeted, phoned and Facebooked.
They learned the incident was not a drill and kept in touch with parents, but they also got misinformation that made the tragedy sound even worse than it was.
Authorities said a teen gunman opened fire inside the school cafeteria around 7:30 a.m., fatally wounding one student and seriously injuring four others. The suspect was taken into custody near his car a half-mile from the Cleveland-area school of 1,100 students. 
Heather Ziska, 17, said she was in the cafeteria when she heard popping noises in the hall. She said she saw a boy she recognized as a fellow student enter the cafeteria and start shooting.
"Everybody just started running," said 17-year-old Megan Hennessy, who was in class when she heard loud noises.
Hiding in classrooms, frightened students spent more than an hour trying to communicate with the outside  and get reliable information, said senior Matt Goergen, 17, who was in first-period English class  when the school went into lockdown. Many in the room didn't believe there was a shooting until "a girl sitting next to me got a call from her dad saying it was real," he said in a text-message interview.
Sophomore Trevor Miducki, 16, was in the hallway next to the cafeteria when he saw two girls "running down the hallway, just, like, sprinting" from the cafeteria.
Locked in his first-period English class, Miducki heard sirens.  "We were all wondering what happened," he said. "We were all frantically texting our parents.   We were keeping calm but were all so scared."
Miducki said the atmosphere during lockdown was calm at first, but as the morning wore on, "it started to get more frantic and panicky."
After police confirmed that a shooting had taken place, "it was pretty panicked. Girls shaking. Guys shaking. People calling their moms. It got pretty intense pretty fast."
Senior Seanna Sicher, 18, was in physics class.
"My class assumed that it was just a drill and drifted toward the back wall. Lights were turned out, the door was locked, the window covered," she said. "It was maybe five minutes later when our teacher received an e-mail and people started checking their phones. We realized immediately that it was serious and the whole room fell silent."
Sicher described the scene as similar to "a 9/11 movie" as students tried  to reach loved ones.
"It was almost impossible to send a message, too, because so many of us were trying," Sicher said by e-mail. "We were confused because everyone was hearing a different story: The shooter was caught, there were two shooters, six people shot, one person shot, shooter still on the loose -- nobody knew what to believe. We had calls and texts from friends and family across the state and even country asking if we were OK."
Miducki and other students said social networking was helpful -- except when it wasn't. Rumors flew on Twitter.
"We heard so many different stories -- it was crazy what we heard," he said.
Five students, including Daniel Parmertor and Demetrius Hewlin, were taken to local hospitals. Metro Health Medical Center later identified Parmertor as the lone fatality. But by then, a Twitter user had created an #RIPDemetrius hashtag mistakenly identifying Hewlin as the victim.
The school used a phone-alert system to tell parents about the shooting, and hundreds of parents rushed to the school,  where police, FBI, SWAT teams and  ambulances  were on the scene.
FBI agent Scott Wilson would not comment on a possible motive. Freshman Danny Komertz, 15, said the suspect was an outcast.
The suspected shooter is a student at Lake Academy, not Chardon High, said Brian Bontempo, superintendent of the Lake County Educational Service Center, which operates the academy.
Junior Nate Mueller, speaking to The Plain Dealer in Cleveland, identified the alleged gunman, but USA TODAY is  withholding the name because he is a juvenile and no formal charges had been filed.
The attack occurred amid a steady drop in school violence. After peaking in the 2003-04 school year with 49 fatalities, the number of students killed on campus has steadily declined.
Miducki,  speaking by phone around 2 p.m.,  said he was still having trouble wrapping his mind around the shooting.
"It's so hard to grasp," he said. "This is literally something you would see in a movie or a video game."
Toppo reported from McLean, Va. Contributing: Alicia McCarty in McLean; the Associated Press.

Shadid found his way home in 'House of Stone'; 
Before his death, reporter poured heart into book

BYLINE: Bob Minzesheimer, USA TODAY

SECTION: LIFE; Pg. 1D

LENGTH: 1317 words

Reporter Anthony Shadid was, as he wrote, "never the type to stay home."
But before he died Feb. 16 at age 43 while covering the civil war in Syria for The New York Times, Shadid had found a home.
Not in Oklahoma City, where he was born and raised. Nor in Iraq, where his coverage of the war and its aftermath for The Washington Post won two Pulitzer Prizes. Nor in Cambridge, Mass., where he had a house.
Home was found in a Lebanese village in an abandoned and looted house built by his great-grandfather. Shadid's quest -- "quixotic," he called it -- to renovate the house is chronicled in his book, House of Stone: A Memoir of Home, Family and a Lost Middle East (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, $26), released today.
The book "meant more to him than you can imagine," says Shadid's widow, Nada Bakri,  31, who's also a reporter for The New York Times, based in Beirut. 
"The book is about his home, where he found happiness and peace," she says in an e-mail. "It is, as he used to say, 'what I created, what I made from imagination.'" The house "is his legacy, what he will leave for his children, Malik (who's nearly 2) and Laila (10, from a previous marriage), and generations to come after them."
After Shadid's death, his publisher moved up the book's release date by a month. It's turning what was to have been a 20-city book tour by Shadid into a series of memorial events with the author's friends, family and fellow journalists. Among those to speak about Shadid and for him and his book are CBS News' Bob Schieffer and a cousin, Oklahoma City Councilman Ed Shadid.
Bakri, who was born in Lebanon and married Shadid in 2009, plans to fly today  to Boston from Beirut. "I feel like the natural thing to do, as painful as it is going to be, seeing the book and talking about it when Anthony is not present, is to do whatever I can to publicize it."
Shadid was a reporter for 25 years, 15 of them as a foreign correspondent in the Middle East, starting with the Associated Press and The Boston Globe.
Last year, in a call-in show on National Public Radio, he was asked about the risks of his job and why anyone would put himself in such danger.
Shadid called it a "perfectly legitimate question" and added, "I felt that if I wasn't there, the story wouldn't be told."
In early February, Shadid and a New York Times photographer entered Syria for a week, despite a ban on Western reporters who have focused on a government crackdown that has killed at least 6,000 civilians. (Last week, American journalist Marie Colvin and French photographer Remi Ochlik were killed in Syria by a rocket fired by the Syrian army.)
According to The Times, Shadid was leaving Syria on horseback and apparently had an asthmatic reaction to the horses and stopped breathing.
He had close calls before. In 2002, he was shot in the shoulder in the West Bank. Last year, in Libya, he and three colleagues were arrested and beaten by forces loyal to dictator Moammar Gadhafi.
But Shadid was no "stick-out-the-chest tough guy," says George Hodgman, his longtime book editor. "He was so unlike the clich of the war reporter. He was gentle and kind but driven."
'He had to learn to live'
After Libya, "I think he knew that the days when he could continue to take such risks were coming to a close," Hodgman says. "He adored his wife. He adored his children. He had learned how to have a home. He had learned to live."
Steve Fainaru, a former Washington Post colleague and now editor of The Bay Citizen in San Francisco, visited Shadid at his ancestral home in Lebanon last spring and says: "I've never seen him happier. He was so proud."
As a reporter, Shadid was "truly irreplaceable," Fainaru says, "but there wasn't an ounce of pretension about him. He was a normal guy."
The book opens in 2006, when a war-weary Shadid was covering the Israeli invasion of Lebanon after Hezbollah, the militant arm of the Shiite Muslims in Lebanon, had killed three Israeli soldiers and kidnapped two others.
Shadid writes that "in retaliation, the pretext for reprisals that are never proportionate, the Israelis unleashed a thirty-three day barrage that destroyed entire villages and left more than 1,100 dead, most of them civilians." He called it "the grisliest conflict I had tried to describe."
His career overseas had taken a toll at home in suburban Maryland, where his first wife and daughter lived.
After the 2002 shooting, he writes, "I recovered, for the most part. My wife did not. Our home was breaking, broken, finally broken up. By the time I arrived in Lebanon, I was a suitcase and a laptop drifting on a conveyor belt."
In the village of Marjayoun, Shadid found the once-elegant, two-story house built nearly a century ago by his great-grandfather Isber Samara,  who had sent his children off to America for a better future.
Shadid's great-grandmother Bahija had lived here until she died in 1965. Later, it was abandoned and looted.  In 2006, a half-exploded Israeli rocket crashed into the second floor.
Shadid found a mess but embarked on what he called "a small odyssey." He would take a year's leave from his job with The Washington Post and restore the house to "bring back something that was lost."
He spoke Arabic, but he notes it was "an Oklahoma-accented Arabic, sprinkled with Egyptian colloquialisms," which suggested "I was dimwitted, as any foreigner here is considered."
In his ancestral village, his ambition to rebuild the house was "considered foolish and rash by my neighbors, not to mention reckless, dangerous and altogether 'American.'" Some were convinced he was a CIA spy, "my cover brilliant."
He persevered despite a carpenter "so utterly lacking in punctuality that he measured time in seasons" and a painter who was discovered to be color-blind after rendering one room in three colors. His contractors became a community -- "the fractious, divided and dysfunctional sort that finds itself susceptible to civil war."
But he also found local craftsmen with pride in their work. He became obsessed with repairing and restoring the house's old ornate cemento tile, "whispers of a culture now gone." He saw the tile as not just a relic, but "a tribute to the imaginations it nourished," a symbol of Lebanon's culture spoiled by war.
House of Stone is not a traditional memoir. Despite glimpses of Shadid's personal and professional life, it's less about the author than about Lebanon's rich and tortured history, and his ancestors, those who stayed and those who emigrated to America.
Hope to tragedy and back
The book ends optimistically: "I turned an abandoned house, wrecked by war, into something that was the closest I have come to elegance." He predicts, "There was more life to come in this old house."
His epilogue was written last September, after the Egyptian uprisings, "a time for transformation as Egypt reimagined home." He describes his release from Libya and how "I wanted to go home, and naturally I went to Marjayoun with my new wife and infant son."
Shadid's publisher, Bruce Nichols, says the book ends "on a wonderfully hopeful note, now transformed into one of the saddest passages imaginable."
But he adds: "Though it invokes tears today, I hope readers will be nourished for many years by the book's great heart. Anthony's rediscovery of his roots, and excavation of the many great values of his ancestral culture, are timelessly inspiring."
Shadid's funeral, attended by family, diplomats and colleagues, was  Feb. 21 at the American University in Beirut, which awarded him an honorary doctorate last year.
A day later, in accordance with his wishes, his ashes were spread in the garden outside the stone house in Marjayoun. His widow says, "We chose a spot between the two ancient olive trees that he loved" and marked it with his beloved tile.
"In the spring," she says, "I will plant wild tulips around it, the kind he liked."
The house "is my home," she says. "It is where Anthony is and will always be."

Ohio victims shot at random; 
Death toll rises to 3; classes set to resume on Friday

BYLINE: Greg Toppo, USA TODAY

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 840 words

Classes will resume Friday  at Chardon High School near Cleveland, four days after a 17-year-old shot five  students in one of the worst U.S. school shootings of the past several years.
The suspect,  T.J. Lane, told police that he did not target his victims when he fired 10 shots from a .22-caliber pistol that killed three students and injured two others.
"He chose his victims at random," Geauga County prosecutor David Joyce said Tuesday following the suspect's first court appearance.  "This is not about bullying. This is not about drugs." 
Tuesday's hearing came hours after the death toll rose to three, making the Chardon shooting the worst in a U.S. high school since a 2005 shooting in  Red Lake, Minn., that  killed 10.
Demetrius Hewlin, 16, who had been in critical condition, died Tuesday morning; Russell King Jr., 17, died earlier in the morning, police said. Daniel Parmertor, 16, died of his wounds Monday.
In other developments:
Joyce said  Lane told police he used a  .22-caliber pistol Monday  that he stole from an uncle.
During a brief hearing in juvenile court, Judge Timothy Grendell ordered Lane held for at least the next 15 days. Prosecutors have until Thursday to charge him and  are expected to ask that he be tried as an adult.
Chardon Police Chief Tim McKenna said one of the wounded  students, Joy Rickers, has been released from the hospital. One teenage boy is still hospitalized.
Lane's family had a history of sometimes violent conflict, court records show. Lane himself was charged with assault in 2009 after a fight  involving his uncle, according to a police report obtained by Gannett's WKYC-TV in Cleveland. Lane told police he thought his uncle had attacked his brother, and Lane came to his brother's aid. The uncle, however, said he was the victim.
Lane later pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct, according to the court records.
Lane's father has been convicted twice of assaulting women with whom he had children. The first happened in 1997 when Thomas Lane was charged with attacking T.J. Lane's mother. He was convicted of assault and resisting arrest, according to court records.
The shooting rocked the northeast Ohio town, but the fact that the school will reopen by week's end is "huge," said Dave Cullen, author of the 2009 book Columbine, an  account of the 1999 killings at the Jefferson County, Colo., high school.
He said Jefferson County  officials waited a week before letting Columbine students back  at school again. "I think if they would have done it again, they would have done it sooner. Those kids were really desperate to be with each other again."
Cullen said Chardon school officials "seem to definitely be on the right track, trying to make that balance between giving kids time and space on their own yet realizing they do have to get them into school, they do need to be with each other."
When the students return to school, experts say, they'll need time to discuss the shootings and to reflect.
"The number of victims is not five," said Carolyn Mears, a researcher at the University of Denver's Morgridge College of Education. "Anyone connected with the school has been victimized by the shooting and are now trauma survivors."
Lane did not go to Chardon High, instead attending  Lake Academy, which is for students with academic or behavioral problems.
Mears  is the mother of a child who was  at Columbine  during  the April 1999 shootings. Her son was physically unharmed, but the experience prompted her to study school traumas. She said a common mistake  is to assume that all kids want to talk about what happened.
"Some kids will want to write about it; some kids will want to talk about it," she said. "Some kids will want to shut up and be left alone."
Johns Hopkins University sociologist Katherine Newman  said many Chardon students may be coming to terms with guilt over missed signals that could have prevented the attacks. Like other researchers who have studied school shootings, Newman found that shooters announce their intentions, but often with a "noisy signal" that's  hard to decode. "With hindsight it's much easier to interpret," she said.
As traumatic as Monday's shooting was to those who experienced it, statistics show that school shootings in the U.S. are rare and becoming more rare.
Between 1992 and 2010, school violence among students ages 12 to 18 generally declined, according to a report  this month by the U.S. Department of Education.
Despite the trend, the Ohio shooting illustrates that schools must continue to make themselves safer, said Ronald Stephens, executive director of the National School Safety Center, based in Westlake Village, Calif.
"It's just a reminder that schools continue to be vulnerable despite the best efforts we take," he said. "It's a reminder that we need to keep school safety high on the education agenda, for school officials to redouble their efforts to provide supervision on instances of bullies and for parents to keep in touch with students," he said.

'He was an average 7-year-old kid'; 
Prosecutors see a killer; those who knew suspect, an 'easy-going' teenager

The tumultuous home life of T.J. Lane spun into violence on a Wednesday night in December 2009.
He was 15 and living with his older brother and younger sister at the home of his grandparents. They had taken custody of the kids after the children's mother split with T.J.'s father, a sometimes steelworker with a record of domestic violence. The grandparents had gone out, leaving the kids with their 44-year-old uncle, John Breuning. The household was tense, police later noted, because T.J. had refused to go to a volunteer service job required by his school.
Around 8 p.m., according to a police report, T.J.'s 16-year-old brother got into a fight with Breuning, who wanted the boy to go to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting because of his "known heroin addiction." T.J. joined the fray -- he later said he was trying to protect his brother -- and by the time police arrived, Breuning  was bloodied and wanted to press charges against both boys. 
T.J.'s grandparents returned, and the chaos continued. The grandmother "was difficult to calm down," police later wrote, because she feared that Breuning's charges would derail the older brother Adam's  court-ordered drug rehabilitation program. She "continued to yell" at the boys, Breuning  and his wife, who had called the police when the fight broke out.
Lane's difficult background is emerging as just one piece  of a complex puzzle as investigators  seek to unravel the motivations behind the nation's worst school shooting since 2006.
Prosecutors are expected to charge Lane today  with the killing of three students in a rampage Monday at Chardon High School. They have said they plan to ask that Lane be tried as an adult in the killings  of Demetrius Hewlin, 16; Russell King Jr., 17; and Daniel Parmertor, 16. Another boy remains hospitalized in serious condition and an 18-year-old girl was released from the hospital Tuesday.
Neighbors and friends of Lane's family are struggling to reconcile the seemingly easy-going, well-adjusted kid they said they knew with prosecutors' description of a troubled teen who sprayed 10 shots from a Ruger .22-caliber Mark III target pistol into  the cafeteria at Chardon High School.
"I've known him since he was 3- to 5-years-old (and) he was a quiet, easy-going kid," said Russ Miller, 65, a retired steel cutter who lives next door to Lane's grandparents on Wilson Mills Road in this town of about 5,000. "He always had a smile on his face. He would be the last person in the world I would think would do something like this. He was an average 17-year-old kid who was being raised by two loving grandparents.  They're devastated."
But prosecutors suggested that Lane was troubled in ways that aren't easily spotted.
"This is not about bullying. This is not about drugs," Geauga County Prosecutor David Joyce said after Lane's first court hearing Tuesday. "This is someone who is not well, and I'm sure in our court case, we'll prove that to all of your desires."
Why it happens
Since the 1992-93 academic year, there have been at least seven shootings at U.S. high schools and middle schools -- including Chardon -- in which three or more people died, according to the National School Safety Center, a California non-profit that studies school violence. And researchers have spent countless hours trying to dissect the motivations and psychology of the killers.
Studies on past school rampages by the FBI, the U.S. Secret Service and others show that most shooters don't just "snap" -- they plan carefully and often tell others, if sometimes cryptically, about their intentions. In one shooting, the assailant warned beforehand, "You'll see who lives or dies on Monday." In another, the shooter brought a small cache of guns to school, only to have classmates tell him to come back with a shotgun.
A 2002 study issued by the Secret Service and the U.S. Education Department found that in 81% of cases, at least one friend was told of the shooter's plans -- and in 59%, more than one friend was told. No evidence has emerged that Lane told anyone of plans to attack the high school.  The study also found that while most school shooters felt depressed and persecuted at the time of the shooting, they followed no set personality profile.
And, while the prosecutor in the case said the boy "was not well," journalist and author Jeff Kass said the teen's condition "may have also been exacerbated by difficult surroundings."
Kass, author of the 2009 book Columbine: A True Crime Story, said many of these tragedies  take place in suburbs and small towns for a reason. "School shootings tend to occur in these places because they are so homogeneous that youths who differ from others feel like complete outcasts who have no place else to turn," he said.
Appeared 'well adjusted'
When T.J. Lane appeared in court Tuesday, neither of his parents was at his side.
The boy was accompanied by his grandfather and two aunts, who reached over and lightly embraced the grandfather as the hearing began. Lane's face twitched lightly while the prosecutor recounted the attack, noting that Lane confessed to the shooting when he was arrested without resistance on a street near the school. The boy sniffled and half-closed his eyes as he walked out of the courtroom with deputies.
Miller, the grandparents' neighbor, remembers when T.J., his older brother and younger sister came to live with their maternal grandparents about 14 years ago. He said the family felt T.J. "was well adjusted" and recalls a boy who liked to skateboard and run barefoot in the neighborhood.
T.J.'s schoolwork slipped about a year ago, Miller said, and he moved to Lake Academy Alternative School, which bills itself as a school for students "experiencing serious challenges in meeting expectations within traditional school settings." Miller said that T.J. had gotten back on track at the school, which has small classes and stresses individual attention, and was set to graduate this year with high grades.
T.J. was close to his younger sister and grandparents but distant from his older brother, Miller said. He didn't want to go into details about T.J.'s relationship with his parents but suggested they were not a big presence in the children's lives.
Court records paint a picture of a combative relationship between Lane's parents. A year after T.J. was born, his mother, Sarah Nolan, successfully sued his father, Thomas Lane, to establish paternity. During T.J.'s early childhood, the parents' repeated altercations resulted in both facing charges. In a 1997 incident, Thomas Lane was charged with assault and resisting arrest.
After the couple split, Thomas Lane remarried  and was charged with assaulting his new wife in 2002, after the couple had filed for divorce. In that case, court records show, he strangled the woman and banged her head into a wall. She lost consciousness, and Lane ultimately was sentenced to four years in prison. He served about seven months and was placed on probation.
But Miller and other friends of the family said in interviews that there were no obvious signs of trouble in the household where T.J. lived with his grandparents, despite some of its complicated dynamics.
'Who could do something like this?'
Tim Klepac, 52, who describes himself as a longtime friend of Lane's maternal and paternal grandparents, said the family can't make sense of what's happened. He noted that his own son was in the Chardon High School cafeteria when the shooting occurred --  and so was T.J.'s younger sister.
Klepac said he visited  T.J.'s grandparents Tuesday, and the boy's grandmother said that when she heard news of the shooting, "she thought, 'Who could do something like this?' And then to find out it's your own grandson. It's unexplainable."
There was evidence of a softer side of T.J. on his Facebook page, which was taken down shortly after the shootings. In one photo, he's seated holding a large stuffed bear wearing a pink bib that says, "Be Mine."
But images from the page, captured and re-posted by The Huffington Post, also show another side of Lane. In one poem, posted in December, he takes on the voice of death, writing, "His only company to confide in was the vermin in the street; He longed for only one thing, the world to bow at his feet.  Feel death, not just mocking you. Not just stalking you but inside of you. Wriggle and writhe. Feel smaller beneath my might. Seizure in the pestilence that is my scythe. Die, all of you."

Roy rethinking retirement

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 5C

LENGTH: 479 words

Brandon Roy's bad knees seemed to be why the three-time All-Star guard retired before the NBA season, but he might not be done yet, which comes as news to his former team, the Portland Trail Blazers.
"It's hard being away from the game. Don't be surprised if you see Brandon Roy make his way back to the court," Roy told Eurobasket.com, a website covering global basketball. 
Roy, 27, has been rehabilitating his knees in his hometown of Seattle but says his retirement wasn't health-related.
"There's something to it, but it's not the right time for me to get into it right now," he said. "I've been doing some treatment, and I'm trying to leave the window open to returning to basketball."
Roy, let go by the Blazers under the amnesty clause in the league's new labor agreement, wouldn't be eligible to play for them again until his contract expired in 2015. But he could play for any other team.
Portland coach Nate McMillan said he was unaware Roy was thinking about coming back, telling The Oregonian that was surprising.
Clippers woes: When guard Chauncey Billups went down with a season-ending Achilles tear Feb.6, his Los Angeles Clippers were 15-7. With Randy Foye starting at shooting guard, the Clippers have gone 5-5, including Tuesday's 109-97 home loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves. Foye shot 35.4% in those games but averaged 11.1 points vs. 7.3 in his previous 22.
The Clippers, aside from forward Blake Griffin (30 points) and point guard Chris Paul (27), shot 19 of 49 (39%) vs. the Timberwolves. But even with a six-game road trip ahead, Paul said there was no panic.
"I'd give any of those guys the same shots that they had," Paul told news reporters. "Those are some of the best shooters in the league. Any other night, those shots fall and it's a different game. It's a long season."
Timberwolves rookie forward Derrick Williams, from the Los Angeles area, got over his All-Star dunk contest fiasco in a big way with a career-high 27 points on 9-for-10 shooting (4-for-4 on three-pointers) and 5-for-5 on free throws in 27 minutes.
Also: The Charlotte Bobcats, who own the NBA's worst record at 4-29, don't have any injured players for the first time. Guard Gerald Henderson, who missed nine games with a hamstring strain, returned in Wednesday's 109-94 loss to the Detroit Pistons. "In some games we had the desire but not the talent," coach Paul Silas said. "Now we have the talent."  Philadelphia 76ers coach Doug Collins, who left after the third quarter of Tuesday's win vs. the Pistons with flu-like symptoms, returned Wednesday in the 92-88 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder. "I feel great," he said. "I got a little dehydrated last night."  Golden State Warriors coach Mark Jackson on the 102-78 loss Tuesday to the Indiana Pacers: "I don't know how much (work the players) put in during the break, but the data, which means the game, suggests not much."

Time for Assad to go; 
Removing Syrian leader won't be easy, but there are ways to encourage him to step down

BYLINE: Dennis B. Ross

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 7A

LENGTH: 917 words

Every day brings new horrors in Syria. The Assad regime has declared war on its own citizens, with the death toll rising into the thousands. Whether in Homs or Hama or Daraa or Idlib or other cities and villages, the Syrian civilian population faces indiscriminate fire from the tanks, artillery, mortars and heavy machine guns of the Syrian security forces.
Not given the choice of limiting their actions to peaceful demonstrations, the opposition to the Assad regime has had no choice but to become more violent. In truth, if Syria is to be spared a destructive and destabilizing civil war, the only hope is to accelerate the departure of Bashar Assad. 
It is easier to speak of his  departure  than to produce it. Indeed, there is no single step that will guarantee it, but there are a series of actions that could accelerate his departure. Though the isolation of the Assad regime and the sanctions against it have weakened the Syrian president, they have not undermined his hold on power. Several actions will be needed:
First, it is necessary to keep pressure on the Russians to change their posture. Propping up Assad might preserve the Russian position in Syria for the time being, but it will undermine it over time. No successor leadership in Syria is going to want ties to the Russians, whose veto at the U.N. Security Council has been seen in Syria and throughout the Middle East as giving the Assad regime a license to kill.
Unless the Russians change course and are able to take credit for producing the end of the Assad regime, they will see their position deteriorate both in Syria and in the region more generally.
Russians a key player
Having Arab leaders remind the Russians of this could produce a change, and it is vital. Assad and those who support him in the security establishment see the Russians as their insurance policy -- a protector in the U.N. and an impediment to external intervention. Change that perception, and the balance of power is likely to shift inside Syria.
Second, it is time to raise the status of the Syrian National Council (SNC), the formal Syrian opposition. It must increasingly be seen as the recognized successor to the Assad regime -- or at least the vehicle for managing the transition to a new and inclusive leadership.
Withholding recognition of the  council as the alternative to Assad made sense as a way to encourage its leaders to overcome petty rivalries and develop a coherent, non-sectarian plan for shaping the future of Syria. Last week, when the "Friends of Syria" -- a group that includes the U.S., Britain, France, Turkey and a number of Arab countries -- met in Tunis, international leaders treated the SNC as a legitimate representative of the Syrian people. Though a step in the right direction, more will need to be done to create an aura of inevitability about the SNC as the alternative to Assad.
Buttressing opposition
That, too, is likely to have an effect on those who continue to back Assad or fear an alternative to him. Clearly, the opposition council will have to create greater coordination with those who are deserting from the Syrian military and make up what is known as the Free Syrian Army as it challenges the regime and tries to protect the Syrian public. Raising the international standing of the SNC could assist that effort.
Third, it is necessary  to reach out to the Alawite community  that makes up 12% of the Syrian population but represents the backbone of the security establishment. Assad has become an exclusively sectarian leader, seeking to convey that if he goes,  Alawites will be decimated by a radical Sunni onslaught.
It is essential to find ways of communicating with key Alawites and making clear that Assad is not the key to their salvation but  the greatest threat to their survival. The longer he stays, the more violent the breakdown in Syria will become. The outreach to the Alawites must be consistent, involve Sunnis forswearing vengeance against Alawites, and reassurance from the SNC and the "Friends of Syria" about how the transition will be managed to preserve the unity and non-sectarian nature of Syria's future.
Last, more must  be done to play on Assad's fears. Sanctions and isolation alone won't make him leave. He must see that the balance of power is shifting against him. Assad is no Moammar Gadhafi. He won't go underground and try to lead an uprising. He must see that options he thought would not be considered are on the table.
Creating humanitarian corridors or  safe areas for civilians, though difficult to implement, need to be on the table and developed as a real possibilities. Arming the Free Syrian Army when it lacks clear organization and is highly localized raises a number of troubling questions about who would be armed and what could take shape in Syria. But there is help short of arms that could alter the realities on the ground, such as blocking the communications of Assad's forces and facilitating those of the Free Syrian Army. Moreover, given the behavior of Assad's forces, lethal assistance managed in a coherent way through Jordan and Turkey should not be ruled out.
For reasons of morality and the interest of not seeing violence in Syria build and expand outward, it is essential to try to accelerate the departure of Bashar Assad.

After daughter's death, marching on

BYLINE: Patrick Magee, Hattiesburg (Miss.) American

LENGTH: 539 words

While the Southern Mississippi men's basketball team enjoys a march toward the postseason with a Division I school-record 24 victories and counting, senior guard Angelo Johnson carries  memories of a summer tragedy.
Not that anyone can tell. Johnson, scheduled for his 106th  college start Saturday at Marshall, maintains his smile and upbeat attitude through a season that could include the school's first NCAA bid since 1991. But eight months ago, the Minneapolis native experienced a parent's worst nightmare -- the death of a child.
His 4-year-old daughter, Eliana, died July 13 from complications related to sickle cell anemia, a hereditary disease that affects red blood cells. 
"She was my best friend," Johnson said. "We were really close. God called her home this summer."
While sickle cell anemia can bring on frequent illness, Eliana had been mostly healthy. A case of pneumonia in July put her in the hospital for the second time.
"She got real sick, and it didn't clear up," Johnson said. "Two days before, they were sticking her with needles. She was just wishing everybody would leave her alone. She ended up having a stroke."
USM coach Larry Eustachy and assistant  Steve Barnes  traveled to Minnesota to be with Johnson and his family.
"In that situation, he comforted the people around him more than he comforted himself," Eustachy said. "That's the kind of guy he is. Sometimes he spreads himself thin. He worries about everybody. If that's a bad quality, I wish I had it."
Johnson said, "(Eustachy) is a second father to me, and Coach Barnes is an uncle. Seeing those guys there made me happy. They were there for me."
While taking little time to deal with his grief, Johnson turned his attention to his fiance and Eliana's mother, Diamond Dotson.
"I felt her pain more than anything because I was gone a lot," Johnson said. "She took care of her every day.
"I just wanted to keep our family together because everybody started going their separate ways. I just wanted to keep it all jelled together."
Johnson, 23, said there was a moment after his daughter's death when he considered not returning for his senior season.
His career has been quite tumultuous.
He was shot in the calf in Minneapolis in May 2010 in a drive-by shooting. He transferred from Southern California after the 2007-08 season despite starting 11 games as a freshman.
Less than a month before Eliana's death, Johnson's second daughter, D'Ayona, was born.
"It was kind of hard, because I had a baby with a different mother," Johnson said. "It's kind of hard seeing another baby born and then losing one. It's really difficult. This one looked just like the one we lost. It's kind of hard for me. She's here, and we thank the Lord every day that I've had another."
Johnson averages 9.1 points and 3.1 assists a game. The Golden Eagles (24-6, 11-4) have at least the No. 2 seed in the Conference USA tournament next week. Their Ratings Percentage Index of 13 bodes well for an NCAA tournament bid.
Johnson played in the NCAA tournament as a freshman for USC. But he  is thankful for the chance to make a return trip in his final college season.
"I couldn't ask for a better (senior season)," Johnson said. "It's the best decision I ever made, coming here from USC."

Slain students' families discuss lost loved ones; 
Mother urges openness as 'life goes on'

BYLINE: Yamiche Alcindor, USA TODAY

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 831 words

The families of three of the five students shot in Monday's deadly school shooting opened up about their loved ones -- and the alleged gunman's former stepmother said the attack came out of nowhere.
Julie Grey, T.J. Lane's former stepmother, told WKYC-TV in Cleveland that  Lane would visit her house on occasion and wanted to start college this summer. One of her daughters was with  Lane on Sunday night. "They were having a relaxing weekend," Grey said. "They hung out, did things together. There was no sign."
She said Tom Lane, T.J. Lane's dad, had gotten more involved in the teen's life recently. 
Phyllis Ferguson, the mother of Demetrius Hewlin, 16, who died after being shot, said at a news conference that the tragedy should be an example of the importance of cherishing your children.
"This is one thing that we all should do for our children every day; no matter if they're ornery, whatever they're going through," she said. "You grab your child, even if they're mad at you, they'll get over it. Life goes on. You grab your children, you hug them and kiss them and you tell them you love them. If you can't tell them, you show them."
Ferguson said her son's organs were donated to help others.
T.J. Lane  was charged Thursday with three juvenile counts of aggravated murder in connection with Monday's school shooting that killed three high school students. Two other students were wounded in the attack.
The Geauga County prosecutor says Lane, 17, had admitted firing 10 shots at a group of students in the high school cafeteria, killing Hewlin, Russell King Jr., 17, and Daniel Parmertor, 16. Lane also faces two counts of attempted aggravated murder and one count of felonious assault.
Hewlin attended Chardon High. King and Parmertor were students at a vocational school and were waiting in the Chardon High cafeteria for their daily bus when they were shot.
Daniel Parmertor's family also spoke at the same news conference. Dominic Parmertor described his younger brother, Daniel, as "the happiest kid on the planet. I never once saw him mad. We were very close. He loved us very much."
Parmertor had dreams of attending Ohio State University to study computer networking, his brother said.
Holly Walczak, the mother of one of the surviving students, said her son, Nick Walczak, remains in serious condition at the hospital after being shot four times, WKYC-TV reported.
The juvenile counts of aggravated murder and attempted aggravated murder would mean only a few years in detention if Lane is convicted. But Prosecutor David Joyce has already said he plans to try the boy as an adult, which could mean life in prison if he is found guilty. He remains in custody.
Michael Thomas, 47, whose son is a sophomore at Chardon High School, said the tragedy is  a lesson.
"I am downright mad at this point that my community, my son, and my friends -- that these people are going through this," he said. "I'm thinking this is a commentary on society.  Absentee parents and people that don't give their all to parenting end up with kids that slip through the cracks and then hurt other families."
Earlier Thursday, hundreds of people gathered at the city square. After a moment of silence and some words of remembrance, they quietly marched down the city's roads to Chardon High where grief counselors, school staff members and community members met them.
Traci Arbogast, a stay-at-home mom, said Chardon's recovery rests with its young. "The kids will heal us," she said. "Chardon kids are strong. They are staying busy with fundraising and putting ribbons up. The kids are going to bring the community back."
Chardon School Superintendent Joseph Bergant II  hugged several students inside and outside the school. He declined to make any comments to reporters.
Inside the school, the hallways were filled with red and black. Ribbons hung from lockers and cut-out red paper hearts were placed along the walls. Inside the cafeteria where the carnage took place, teddy bears, flowers and boxes of tissues marked the table where the shooting occurred.  Some students sat at long brown tables recounting the shooting while others cried and pointed to the places where other students had run away from Monday's gunfire.
At a press conference at the school, assistant football coach Frank Hall -- who chased Lane from the cafeteria -- offered his condolences to the victims and their families.
Voice cracking, Hall said, "I'm not a hero, I'm a just a football coach and a study hall teacher."
He thanked school administrators for emergency crisis training. "We all wished we never had to use it, but we used it and it worked," he said.
Emily Petkosek, 15, a sophomore at Chardon High School said looking around at the town's support makes it easier to face going back to classes. "No one is really going to move on fully, but it makes it easier to ease the pain," Petkosek said. "We're one heart beat basically."

'School shootings are gun crimes

SECTION: EDIT; Pg. 9A

LENGTH: 586 words

Sharon Broussard, in The Plain Dealer (Cleveland):
"A teen gunman opened fire in the school
cafeteria of bucolic, rural Chardon High School
Monday morning, fatally shooting three young
men and wounding two other students. . . . It
was a reminder that no place is sacrosanct in a
society where guns are far too common and 
available to vengeful, emotionally unstable or
just plain cruel people. That painful reality is
obvious to those who live in Cleveland neighborhoods
where a string of residents have fallen
prey to gun violence in the last few weeks,
including a 1-year-old baby. None of those incidents
happened in a school, but street killings
have a powerful ripple effect across the city,
particularly among the young, fueling a culture
of shoot first, ask questions later."
Akron Beacon Journal, in an editorial: "The
seeming randomness stuns, and sets in motion a
natural search for answers, for an explanation
and understanding. For the moment, all of that
seems elusive, even with a suspect in custody,
the speculation beginning. What does seem
clear from the early reporting is that the episode
could have been much worse. The school and its
students benefited from the steps they had
taken to prepare for such an incident. . . . More,
a school teacher proved brave chasing the
shooter from the school, leading shortly to an
arrest. What led a young man to gather a gun
and fire at classmates will come later, if at all.
First, there is the fate of the victims, hoping for
recoveries, mourning the loss. Then, there is
Chardon, looking to restore that precious feeling
of security."
Frank Ochberg, on CNN's Global Public
Square: "If kids could not and did not bring guns
to school,wewouldn't have Columbine, Virginia
Tech or Chardon, Ohio. There have been crimes
with knives and bats and fists. But school shootings
are gun crimes. Kids with guns kill kids at
school. I do not think America is an extremist
nation, compared to other nations with bloody
histories and despotic leaders. True, we have
polarized political speech, and some of that
speech is about access to guns. But the reason
we have an American school shooting problem
that exceeds other nations has to do with access
to loaded weapons by kids who should not have
that access."
The Blade, in an editorial: "Students, parents,
school officials, and community leaders are asking
whether they could have prevented the
tragedy. Their counterparts in Ohio and
throughout the nation ask whether enough has
been done, and can be done, to make schools
safe. The answer: Yes and no. School lockdown
drills are a necessary response to potential violence,
but they don't prevent violence. No-tolerance
policies often are aimed more at protecting
schools from liability than changing student
behavior. Students and adults grow complacent
in the absence of an immediate threat. . . . But
doing all the right things won't get rid of all
bullies. And as long as there are bullies and
victims, tragedy can result."
Gabriel Lerner in The Huffington Post: "There
is a problem with the research, analysis and
commentary on these school shootings: It only
focuses on the terrible tragedies where one or
more students suddenly begins killing others at
random. The cases of chronic violence, which
occurs repeatedly and is ongoing, are never
explored -- and these comprise the vast majority,
causing untold devastation and grief. . . .
Chronic violence in school tends to be concentrated
in lower income areas, where the majority
of students are usually Latino or black. The
truth is there is more violence in our schools
than we realize."

Wilt's 100 at 50; 
Chamberlain's historic game had mix of magic, mystery, mythology

BYLINE: Jeff Zillgitt

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 1C

LENGTH: 1551 words

Separating fact from fiction, legend from lore, is never simple when discussing Wilt Chamberlain.
This much is fact and legend: Fifty years ago today, Chamberlain, then 25 and playing for the Philadelphia Warriors, scored an NBA record-100 points in a 169-147 victory against the New York Knicks.
In basketball circles, this is the record, the equivalent of Joe DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak.
Will anyone equal or pass Chamberlain's mark? 
Can anyone?
The closest to give it a shot was Los Angeles Lakers guard Kobe Bryant, who scored 81 against the Toronto Raptors on Jan. 22, 2006.
"I remember I missed some easy ones that probably would have got me to 90," Bryant says.
Numbers and records, so meaningful in baseball, are no less legendary in basketball than Chamberlain's 100 points in a game, an NBA-record 55 rebounds and a 50.4-point scoring average for the 1961-62 season.
The late Hall of Famer had another number he offered up in his 1999 autobiography A View From Above: 20,000 women.
But there was more to Chamberlain than numbers.
As former teammate  Tom Meschery once said, "His truths were larger than truths."
Atlanta Hawks guard Tracy McGrady, who scored 62 points for the Orlando Magic in a 2004 game, has a difficult time seeing a player score 100.
"Not the way the game is played nowadays," he says. "It's just hard for me to see anyone even scoring 80 again. You don't even see 50 no more."
Fifty-point games have decreased in the last four-plus seasons. From the 2007-08 season through Wednesday's games, 12 players for a total of 22 times had scored at least 50.
But 100? Chamberlain's career high until then was 79.
There might be no greater single-game performance than that from Wilton Norman Chamberlain, the Big Dipper, who died in 1999 of  congestive heart failure.
It's a seminal moment in sports drifting further away from comprehension.
"It's such a mythologized moment," said author Gary Pomerantz, who wrote Wilt, 1962: The Night of 100 Points and the Dawn of a New Era.
"It's the statistical Everest of American sports.  Kobe Bryant had 81 in a game in 2006. But that game had none of the social import.  To me the 100-point game becomes this hyperbolic announcement of the ascendency of the black athlete in this sport" -- 15 years after Jackie Robinson broke baseball's color barrier.
"I'll never forget the night he did it," friend and former  teammate Jerry West says. "We were coming from Los Angeles to St. Louis, just checked in the hotel, and one of the bell guys said, 'Did you hear Wilt scored 100?' "
Making Chamberlain's game more mythologized is the absence of footage from the third and final game played in Hershey, Pa.. The NBA hopes some footage is stored away unbeknownst to someone and will  be unearthed one day.
"It was a strange night," Meschery said. "For one thing, you have to imagine  chocolate wafting through the air, small arena.  No reporters from any of the major media there."
It is a story of black-and-white photos and oral and written history juxtaposed vs. the Internet, video game world where scoring 100  is still fantasy.
Although Chamberlain didn't like to talk much about the game, his sister, Barbara Lewis, says he used to say, "Everybody's got a story."
"Here's the big fourth quarter and everybody's thinking, 'How many's Wilt going to get?' He's got 69 going in."
- WCAU's Campbell on the radio
Lewis, 74, says Chamberlain  might have been embarrassed by his memory of scoring 90 points in a high school game and the feeling stuck with him. She notes that Chamberlain looks sheepish in that famous photo of him holding a sheet of paper with "100" written on it.
Lewis says Chamberlain liked to talk about his  visit to the Hershey arcade before the game and the ride home to New York with opponents Willie Naulls and Johnny Green of the Knicks.
"He talked about how he was in some special zone at the arcade, winning teddy bears and basketballs and all kinds of prizes," she says.
The breakdown on his 36 baskets on an NBA-record 63 shots (57%) from the field: 23 points in the first quarter, 18 in the second, 28 in the third and 31 in the fourth.
A career 51% free throw shooter, Chamberlain made 28 of 32 from the line that night.
"What pleased him more than the 100 points was that he made all those free throws," Russell says.
In a zone is right.
"As time goes by, I feel more and more part of that 100-point game," Chamberlain once said. "It has become my handle, and I've come to realize just what I did."
"We're just conjecturing here how many can he make. He's got 9 minutes and 24 seconds left, and the guesses are running as high as 100. Wouldn't that be something?"
- WCAU's Campbell on the radio
Bryant says he has never watched his 81-point game.
"There's nothing I could have learned from that game," he says. "It was just pure fluke, a freak of nature-type thing."
Not even watching to see how possible reaching 90 or 100 points would be?
"If I did watch it, it would only (upset me)  if I saw I really could have had 100," Bryant says.
Bryant made 28 of 46 shots, including seven of 13 three-pointers, and 18 of 20 free throws. He scored 55 in the second half. A video review of each missed shot reveals Bryant could have made a few more.
Giving him the benefit of the doubt is tricky because he shot  60.9% that game. Of his 18 misses,  two were open threes and a couple were runners in the lane.
Bryant had a shot at 90. To reach 100, he would have needed to make 36 of his 46 shots, including nine of his 13 threes, and 19 of his 20 free throws.
"If you know anybody not listening, call them up. A little history you are sitting in on tonight."
- WCAU's Campbell on the radio
Bryant,  like Chamberlain, attended high school in the Philadelphia area.
Bryant met Chamberlain twice -- once at the 1997 All-Star Game in Cleveland, when Bryant was 18, and once  as a youngster.
"I was like 7 or 8," Bryant says. "My father (former NBA player Joe Bryant) introduced me to him. It was in McGonigle Hall at Temple University.
"My father said, 'Kobe, I want to introduce you to somebody. He's one of the greatest players of all time.' I just looked at him and I go, 'Bombaata.'
"He's Bombaata in Conan the Destroyer. That's the only thing I knew him as -- Bombaata.
"He picks me up. It's like the coolest thing ever. Wilt was a great sport about it."
"Wilt laughs as if to say, 'What am I doing out here?' He knows what he's doing out here. He's going for one zero zero."
- WCAU's Campbell on the radio
When Chamberlain and Russell played against each other, Russell averaged 14.5 points and 23.7 rebounds, and Chamberlain 28.7 and 28.7.
Russell knew it was a matter of time before Chamberlain scored 100.
"I told him, 'You know, I'm probably the only person on this planet who really knows how good you are,'" Russell says. "The only thing I was really glad about was that I wasn't guarding him that night."
Russell lets loose with his classic high-pitched cackle.
Then Russell's laugh fades.  He  turns serious.
"I'm going to tell you something," Russell says. "He could do that on anybody. I think he went over 60 with me one night. I also know that he set the league record for rebounds in one game (55), and I was the other center that night."
Chamberlain dropped 62 points on Russell and the Celtics on Jan. 1, 1964. For good measure, Chamberlain had 28 rebounds.
"One minute and one second to play. He has 98 points in professional basketball. I'll tell you, that's a lot of points if you're playing grammar-school kids, isn't it?"
- WCAU's Campbell on the radio
One hundred points in a game today seems impossible.
Bryant has no doubts it will happen: "It's inevitable. It'll eventually happen."
NBA Commissioner David Stern, a  Knicks fan growing up, agrees with Bryant. "There is almost no record in the NBA that is safe," Stern says. "And I think that there will be another one. I don't know whether it will be in my lifetime or not."
Russell disagrees. "It would have to be a gimmick," he says.
The game is different today. Pace and style of play have changed. Defenses and offenses have evolved, along with talent on the court.
"Now the coaches have so much more control over it in terms of defending to try and make it difficult for really good players to score," West says.
The 1961-62 Warriors averaged 111 shots. The Warriors took 115 shots the night Chamberlain scored 100; he accounted for 55% of their shots.
One team in the last 30years, the 1990-91 Denver Nuggets, has averaged at least 100 shots.
Lewis and her two sisters, Margaret Lane, 78, and Selina Gross, 76, will attend the Golden State Warriors-76ers game today in Philadelphia. Each fan in attendance will receive 2-inch-by-2-inch squares of the court used that night in Hershey.
"Wilt would be  thrilled," Lewis says. "He loved history so much. "For us as a family to have that piece of floor to give to our children and grandchildren, generations later will know the significance of that."
"The rebound, Luckenbill back to Ruklick into Chamberlain. He made it! He made it! He made it! A Dipper Dunk! He made it! The fans are all over the floor. They stopped the game. People are running out on the court. One-hundred points for Wilt Chamberlain.  The most amazing scoring performance of all time. One-hundred points for the Big Dipper."

9/11 kin seek protocol on handling remains

BYLINE: John Bacon with staff and wire reports

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 618 words

Families of 9/11 victims on Sunday called for congressional hearings to establish protocols on how to handle human remains after tragedies.
Family members including Rosaleen Tallon, sister of victim Sean Tallon, said they oppose a plan to place unidentified human remains of the New York victims in an underground repository. They want the remains encased in a kind of "tomb of the unknown soldier" above ground as part of the memorial.
The families also spoke out against what they called the "desecration" of the remains of victims of the terrorist attacks on the Pentagon and the crash near Shanksville, Pa. Last week, military officials revealed that partial remains of several victims were incinerated by a military contractor and sent to a landfill. 
Virginia Tech tragedy heads to court
The actions of Virginia Tech administrators in the hours leading up to the 2007 mass shooting that left 33 dead are the subject of a trial starting today in Christiansburg, Va.
The parents of slain students Julia Pryde and Erin Peterson want school officials held accountable, lawyer Robert Hall said. He said the parents want an apology for what he calls the university's botched efforts after the first two  killings. He said new evidence reveals missteps. "They want President (Charles) Steger to say, 'I'm sorry. I'm so sorry for the death of your daughters,'" Hall said.
S.F. sheriff faces trial on battery charges
Jury selection begins today in the domestic violence trial of San Francisco Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi, who faces misdemeanor charges for allegedly grabbing and bruising the arm of his wife.
Eliana Lopez is a former Latin American telenovela star, and the case has attracted international attention. Lopez and Mirkarimi have repeatedly denied the allegations. She went on Venezuelan radio in January declaring that prosecutors are out to get her husband. She also stood by Mirkarimi as he was sworn in as sheriff, just days before he was booked at his own jail.
Body found during search for N.M. child
A search for a 4-year-old New Mexico boy led authorities to a deep, narrow hole in a neighbor's backyard where a police spokeswoman says a detective located the body of a child.
Carlsbad police spokeswoman Lt. Jennifer Moyers said authorities are fairly sure the body is that of Samuel Jones, who was reported missing Saturday from his home next door and who was the subject of an AMBER Alert. A renewed house-to-house search had just started Sunday when a detective found the 14-inch-wide hole, Moyers said. Searchers later sent a camera down the hole and confirmed a child was about 30 feet down.
Chicago's top cop says he won't profile
Chicago Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy promised his officers won't conduct blanket surveillance of Muslims in and out of the city like New York police did when he was chief there.
McCarthy addressed hundreds of Muslims on Saturday at the annual banquet of the Council on American-Islamic  Relations-Chicago. He said the department follows leads but "does not and will not conduct blanket surveillance and profiling." In 2007, the NYPD photographed mosques and eavesdropped on Muslim businesses in the city and nearby Newark. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg defended the operations, saying police only follow up on allegations.
Oil boom proves a bust for laundries
The oil business is booming in North Dakota, but some laundries don't want the extra business, The Bismarck Tribune  reports.
A sign on the door of King Koin Laundrette Car and Dog Wash in Bismarck says it "won't allow oil field clothes in this establishment." Owner Mike Walsh and some other laundry operators say oil-saturated gloves make a mess of machines. "It was just getting out of hand," he said.

Sandusky case lacks key details; 
Victims' IDs, specific dates of offenses are 'unknown'

BYLINE: Kevin Johnson, USA TODAY

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 759 words

The original state grand jury reports that outlined a litany of child sex-abuse allegations last fall against former Penn State University assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky were detailed accounts of horrific conduct that spanned 15 years.
Yet  Pennsylvania prosecutors now have filed court papers acknowledging that potentially important details of Sandusky's alleged crimes remain unknown, including the identities of two of the 10 alleged victims.
The documents, some legal analysts and attorneys involved in the case say, offer a possible opportunity to help  Sandusky's legal team  as it prepares to defend the once-revered former defensive coach who is charged with 52 counts of abusive conduct with children. 
In addition to the two unidentified victims, prosecutors say the specific dates of the alleged offenses against seven of the 10 victims are "unknown." In most cases, prosecutors say, they were unable to provide specific dates of the alleged abuse because the incidents were too "numerous."
While Sandusky's attorney, Joe Amendola, did not respond to requests for comment, legal analysts say Sandusky's defense team likely will seize on the unknown details to attack the credibility of the state's case, set for trial May 14.
"It gives the defense an avenue to pursue a theory that, because of the lack of specificity, the witnesses are not credible," says Christopher Mallios, a former Philadelphia prosecutor who specialized in abuse cases. "I certainly understand why the defense is asking for this information."
At the same time, Mallios says the defense -- should it pursue such a challenge at trial -- does so at some risk by questioning victims about why they didn't track the abuse as it occurred.
"You can't expect victims to be checking off the dates on a calendar as this is happening," he says, adding that it is common for child victims to delay reporting abuse. He also says Pennsylvania law generally provides prosecutors leeway if they are not able to associate alleged offenses with specific dates.
"It is not fatal to the prosecution,  but it's something the prosecution is going to have to explain," he says.
The Pennsylvania attorney general's office did not respond to a request for comment.
But attorney Michael Boni, one of the lawyers who represents the victim designated as "Victim 1" by the grand jury, says he "fully expects" Sandusky's team to attempt to "make some hay" by citing some lack of specifics in the charges.
Boni's client, whose allegations launched the broader investigation into the former coach, alleges that he was abused by Sandusky during a period of four years, beginning in 2005 and ending in 2008.
The exact dates of the incidents are "unknown," but prosecutors allege that crimes occurred at Sandusky's house, a Penn State-area hotel and at a high school the boy attended. "The victim, a child at the time of the crimes, is unable to provide exact times and dates" of the offenses, prosecutors said in court documents.
"My sense is that they have precious little to use to try to impeach these victims and witnesses," Boni says. "So I expect them to throw everything against the wall to see if it sticks with a jury. If one strand of spaghetti does stick, then they might have reasonable doubt. I just don't think it will work."
Amendola has said that a central part of his strategy will be to attack the credibility of the state's case through its witnesses.
First among those, he said, will be former Penn State assistant football coach Michael McQueary, who allegedly witnessed Sandusky molesting a boy, about 10 years old at the time, in a Penn State locker room shower in 2002. McQueary says he reported the incident to then-head coach Joe Paterno, then-athletic director Tim Curley and then-senior vice president Gary Schultz.
That account led to the eventual ouster of Penn State President Graham Spanier and Paterno and to related perjury charges against Curley and Schultz who told a state grand jury that McQueary did not specify that Sandusky was sexually assaulting a child. Paterno died Jan. 22.
The victim in that alleged incident, designated as "Victim 2," however, remains unidentified, according to the court documents filed last week.
Attorney Jeffrey Lindy, who has dealt with child sex-abuse cases as a prosecutor and defense attorney, says the absence of identified victims creates a potential problem for prosecutors.
"Without the victim, any kind of sexual abuse-related offense would seem to be hard to prove," Lindy says. "It's like trying to prove a gun case without the gun."

The passionate, dangerous life of a war correspondent

BYLINE: Louise Branson

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 7A

LENGTH: 782 words

Sarajevo, 1994. Mortar shells land near my car, destroy the street ahead. I race for shelter to a bookstore. More explosions, screams; there are dead and injured. Windows shatter, the bookstore shakes. I feel cold, scared; I may be about to die. I try to imagine what that will mean. It will not be big news, at least not for long. More than a dozen foreign correspondents died in the Yugoslav wars. I obsess about my two young sons, growing up without me. I think: What am I doing here? Am I insane? I want to live.
Shortly afterwards, I quit being a war correspondent. Marie Colvin didn't. We worked for years together, for United Press International, then The Sunday Times of London. Marie, 56, was killed late last month, when Syrian dictator Bashar Assad's forces shelled the building where she was working in the town of Homs. Homs has parallels with Sarajevo. In both, defenseless people have been slaughtered by a brutal army as the outside world has dithered. Journalists' reporting from Sarajevo finally helped persuade the world to intervene. Hopefully, Marie's death, and reporting, will help do the same in Syria. 
Marie was  a fearless, imaginative woman.  She drank vodka martinis and whisky, smoked Marlboro cigarettes and rarely backed down to authority. She charmed such dictators as Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. She went where other journalists feared to go.  There are reports that Syrian authorities, Assad himself, deliberately targeted the building where she was. The U.S. government, the U.N., the Arab League and other countries should demand a thorough investigation into those reports. Repressive regimes should know that they cannot kill journalists with impunity.
Journalists often are targeted
Increasingly, though, they believe they can. In Syria, perhaps this isn't so surprising. Assad's father put down an uprising  in Hama 30 years ago  by razing it and killing tens of thousands. He had one rule for survival: Kill everyone who is a threat.  His son is following his lead.
Violent repression might not seem so easy in the age of the Internet, Twitter and cellphones.  From Egypt to Iran to China, though, authorities are trying everything from persecuting people who transmit what they don't like on YouTube or Facebook to shutting down networks. This makes foreign reporters  more important. They magnify, validate and give perspective to the fast-flowing information on social media. Their reports are harder for dictators or the outside world to ignore.
This was certainly what Marie believed. If Assad targeted her, he had good reason. She was among a few  war correspondents who care so passionately about telling the story that they stay longer, work harder, take more breathtaking risks. New York Times journalist Anthony Shadid, who also died  last month in Syria -- of an asthma attack -- was made of the same stuff. Marie's  last day alive  was typical. Her editors had wanted her to leave because of the danger, but she wanted to gather more details.  She was always doing that. Back in the Iran-Iraq war, she snuck into the Iraqi town of Basra disguised in a Muslim veil. She began wearing her distinctive eye patch after she lost an eye to shrapnel while reporting  in Sri Lanka in 2001.
Defenders of victims of war
Marie's passion was to tell the stories of the victims of war. She cared desperately about people, not so much about politics or military hardware. In 1999, in East Timor, she refused to leave 1,500 besieged people in a compound, though 22 other journalists did leave. The people she stayed with credited her with saving their lives. She once said, "Someone has to go  where people are being shot at, and others are shooting at you. The real difficulty is having enough faith in humanity to believe that enough people, be they government, military or the man on the street, will care when your file reaches the printed page, the website or the TV screen. We do have that faith because we believe we do make a difference."
Marie paid the ultimate price. So have too many other journalists. The Committee to Protect Journalists says more than 900  journalists have been killed since 1992, more than 560 of them murdered with impunity. The world should honor them by demanding answers about their deaths, over and over. Dictators and repressive regimes need to know that there will be an outcry when any journalist dies on their watch, and that journalists  cannot be easily silenced. I can see Marie now, raising a vodka martini, Marlboro in hand, nodding approval.

Muslim group rallies support for NYPD

LENGTH: 596 words

Members of an Islamic coalition stood in front of police headquarters with signs Monday to support the New York Police Department's aggressive counterterrorism efforts.
Imam Qazi Qayyoom, one of more than 30 backers of the American Islamic Leadership Coalition who attended the rally, said he believes the NYPD is keeping his community safe and if that means some Muslims are monitored, so be it.
"The police, they come to us and say, 'Is everything OK? How can we help you?'" he said. "They are not trying to hurt us. For this, I want to say thank you and tell them I support them." 
NYPD has been criticized by some Muslim groups  after revelations that it secretly monitored Muslims across the Northeast in the years following the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.
Minn. district settles bullying lawsuits
Minnesota's largest school district  voted to settle a pair of lawsuits over a policy that was criticized for failing to protect gay students from bullying. The Anoka-Hennepin School Board agreed to a long list of measures to help prevent sex-based harassment at its middle and high schools. The district's insurance carrier will pay the six current and former students in the lawsuits a total of $270,000, and the district will tap about $500,000 of its own funds.
The students sued  last summer over a policy requiring staff to remain neutral when the topic of sexual orientation came up in class. The neutrality policy came under fire after six students  committed suicide in less than two years.
Breathalyzer tests coming to Navy ships
The Navy soon will begin giving Breathalyzer tests to many of its sailors before they report to work aboard a ship under a program announced by Navy Secretary Ray Mabus.
Mabus unveiled the plan during an "all hands" call broadcast to sailors worldwide from aboard the USS Bataan at Naval Station Norfolk in Virginia. Details of the program are still being worked out, but about one-sixth to one-eighth of a ship's crew will be given the test. It will target those standing watch and overseeing important aspects of a ship.  Others  may be tested at random.
Condom law kicks in for L.A. porn sets
Actors in many of the adult films made in Los Angeles were required to use condoms under a law that took effect Monday.
"Today really is a milestone in the advance of health and safety for these adult-film makers," said Ged Kenslea, spokesman for the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which lobbied for the measure. The law contains a loophole for some of the larger porn companies, exempting the condom requirement from films made on studio soundstages. City officials and industry leaders are trying to settle on a way to ensure that there's more safe sex on the set.
Flight canceled after box cutter found
A Southwest Airlines flight from Houston to Dallas was canceled after a passenger spotted a box cutter in the plane's overhead bin.
Southwest spokeswoman Olga Romero said the captain alerted airport security and all 97 passengers were taken off the plane and rescreened at Hobby Airport. The plane was searched, but no other hazards were found.

For Allman Brothers, life is one long jam; 
A Lifetime Grammy is no sign that the band is slowing

BYLINE: Marco R. della Cava, USA TODAY

SECTION: LIFE; Pg. 2D

LENGTH: 821 words

Last month, the Allman Brothers Band picked up a special Grammy etched with the words "Lifetime Achievement Award."
It has indeed been a lifetime filled with achievements, but not many Grammys: The Georgia-based group has won just one, for rock instrumental performance (Jessica).
Those trophies really should have read "Incredible Stamina Award." 
For more than four decades, the Allmans have hammered out endless concerts, a few of which yielded one of rock's most legendary live albums, 1971's At Fillmore East. And they're about to do it again: Friday marks the start of yet another of the group's famed March residencies at New York's Beacon Theater.
"I guess we've had a fairly big impact, or we wouldn't have had the longevity," says Gregg Allman, 64, who adds that folding up the traveling musical circus has never been an option.
"If you've gone at it for 43 years, why the hell would you stop?"
No 'coloring up' needed
The band was born in the late '60s and almost crumbled after a  pop-music attempt as the Allman Joys. But spurred by virtuoso brothers Gregg and Duane on Hammond organ and slide guitar, respectively, the hard-driving and -drinking band (which included Berry Oakley on bass, Dickey Betts on lead guitar and drummers Butch Trucks and Jai Johanny Johanson, aka Jaimoe) soon created a following by exploring the blues with jazz-like abandon.
Fans have never lost their passion for the group, which along with the Grateful Dead lit the jam-band torch picked up by Phish and the String Cheese Incident. And they'll learn more about the press-shy band's often painful journey -- Duane Allman and Oakley both died in motorcycle accidents in Macon, Ga., just a year apart in 1971 and 1972 -- with the release May 1 of Gregg Allman's autobiography, My Cross to Bear.
"I threw down," Allman says. "My life don't need no coloring up."
Allman's inimitable blue-eyed soul sound should be especially treasured today given the recent deaths of other blues legends, says Anthony DeCurtis of Rolling Stone.
"On the one hand, the passing of first-generation bluesmen like Hubert (Sumlin, Howlin' Wolf's influential guitarist) and (David) 'Honeyboy' Edwards gives you cause for concern" about the future of the blues, he says. "But when you hear the Allmans play, you feel you don't have to worry too much."
Don't call it 'Southern rock'
Two comparatively recent Allman Brothers additions -- lead guitarist Warren Haynes, 51, joined in 1990, and slide guitar ace Derek Trucks, 32 (nephew of drummer Butch), signed on in 1999 -- sound more like fans than members when reflecting on the group's influence.
"I've been a die-hard since 1969, when I was 9 and my brother first played me their albums," Haynes says. "They've created timeless music that fuses rock, soul, blues, jazz, country and psychedelia. And they don't like the term 'Southern rock.'"
Haynes  laughs.  "Once Gregg was asked why he had a problem with the description. And he said, 'It's kind of redundant. American roots music came from the South. So you might as well call it rock rock.'"
Trucks, whose slide prowess has echoes of Duane's soaring sonic spirit, remains impressed by the original band's tenacity. "These were six guys on a mission, an interracial group of freaks playing this amazing mix of music."
Asked to reflect on the band's past glories, Allman says: "Well, I know for one thing we can't do now what we did then. As Clint Eastwood once said, 'A man's got to know his limitations.'"
He's referring to the length of the band's concerts in the early '70s. "We'd play for six hours sometimes, start late and end with someone opening the doors and the morning sun shooting into your eyes," he says. "Uncle Bill (Graham, the late promoter and owner of the Fillmore East and West) would just say, 'Hey, go for it, guys.' And we did."
Allman says he listens to Fillmore East "three or four times a year. I get nostalgic, seeing how much time has evolved."
He has immersed himself in those years lately by working on his book. He won't disclose much about it, except to say  he had a few hundred cassette tapes filled with reflections that formed the book's foundation. "I started working on this in the mid-'80s.  It'll all be in there."
Always the pinnacle
It will be interesting to hear Allman's take on his feud with Betts, who was fired from the band in 2000. At least one band member hopes to see the day when old bandmates reunite.
"I wish they'd just bury (the hatchet)," Trucks says, recalling a time he shared the stage with Betts as the band played the guitarist's signature composition Blue Sky.
"The guys were playing so well, and Dickey's solo was just so out of this world that when it came time for me to follow him, I didn't know what to do," he says, laughing.
"Those who get to speak to a lot of people musically have a responsibility to set a standard and never go below it," Trucks says. "And for more than 40 years, the Allman Brothers never have."

12 states on path to guns with no permits

BYLINE: Jonathan Ellis, USA TODAY

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 440 words

Legislatures in a dozen states are considering laws that would eliminate requirements that residents obtain permits to carry concealed weapons.
Gun-control advocates view the efforts as part of a long-range strategy to eventually weaken gun laws across the country. But supporters say armed, law-abiding citizens prevent crime. 
Andrew Arulanandam, policy director for the National Rifle Association's Institute for Legislative Action, which supports these legislative efforts, argues that crime rates are low in four states -- Alaska, Arizona, Vermont and Wyoming -- that already allow residents to carry without a permit. "Our viewpoint is, a good person will always be a good person," he said. "They don't need a license to be a good person."
Brian Malte, the director of state legislation for the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, argues the permitless systems put law enforcement officers in a bad situation when they encounter someone with a weapon, and he's critical of efforts that would allow people who have never even shot a firearm to carry one in public.
"They want a gun in every nook and cranny in society with no permission needed and no background check," Malte said, adding,  "This is just a recipe for disaster."
States that have been or are considering bills in  current legislative sessions  include Colorado, Iowa, Georgia, Kentucky, Maine, New Hampshire, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota and Virgina, according to the NRA.
South Dakota could be the fifth state to join the ranks of permitless carry states. Lawmakers last week  passed a measure allowing anyone 18 and older with a valid state driver's license to carry a concealed weapon, as long as they don't have a background that would otherwise prohibit them from getting a permit. The bill awaits action from Republican Gov. Dennis Daugaard.
Mike Milstead, the sheriff of Minnehaha County, the state's largest, says  his office processes about 2,000 permits a year, of which 30 to 40 are rejected because applicants have something in their backgrounds.
"The tough part will be on the small number of people that think they should have a permit that shouldn't," he said.
Wyoming's law went into effect in July. The state continues to issue permits for people who want to travel out of state, said Christopher Lynch, the project manager for the state's concealed firearms program.
In New Hampshire, Republican Rep. J.R. Hoell's bill has cleared the House. Hoell  points to the recent school shooting in Chardon, Ohio,  as a failure of gun control. "Gun-free zones kill people," he said.
Ellis also reports for the Argus Leader in Sioux Falls, S.D.

Syrian crackdown to persist as Assad vows to fight 'foreign plots'; 
Regime forces move into Daraa province

BYLINE: The Associated Press

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 2A

LENGTH: 438 words

Syria's president defied mounting international pressure to end the year-old crackdown on an uprising against him and said Tuesday that he was determined to go on fighting what he called "foreign-backed terrorism." 
"The Syrian people, who have in the past managed to crush foreign plots  have again proven their ability to defend the nation and to build a new Syria through their determination to pursue reforms while confronting foreign-backed terrorism," President Bashar Assad said, according to state news agency SANA.
The military crackdown has turned to southern Daraa province, where the uprising began a year ago. Troops shelled a village in Daraa and clashed with military defectors.
Activists said the military blasted a bridge and a tunnel near the Syrian-Lebanese border that were used as escape routes for  refugees fleeing central Homs province, an opposition stronghold which just endured a heavy month-long offensive.
Rupert Colville, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights in Geneva, described video that has emerged of torture victims allegedly shot secretly in the Military Hospital in Homs as "truly shocking."
The video, broadcast this week on Britain's Channel 4, shows wounded civilian victims blindfolded and chained to their hospital beds, some of them with clear torture marks on their bodies, allegedly at the hands of medical staff.
The United States said it is proposing a new United Nations Security Council resolution demanding an end to violence in Syria, first by government forces and then by opposition fighters. However, Russia and China have said they will block any such resolution.
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Assad, unlike his father and predecessor, will not escape punishment for the violence he has inflicted. Turkey and Syria, which share a border, were allies before the uprising began.
"I would like to remind Bashar Assad: His father was not made to account for what he did in this world, but his son will sooner or later account for what he did, for the massacre and the oppression," he said. "This time, the bloodshed in Syrian cities will not go unpunished."
The father, Hafez Assad, died in office in 2000 after ruling Syria for nearly three decades.
Clashes that broke out in the village of Hirak, where many dissident soldiers are believed to be operating, were some of the worst lately in Daraa province. A video posted online by activists shows what it said was the inside of the Abu Bakr al-Saddiq mosque in Hirak.
There were images of rubble littering the mosque's entryway, doors blown from their frames and shattered glass covering the floor.

Gunman kills school headmistress, himself

BYLINE: John Bacon with staff and wire reports

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 614 words

A Florida man who was fired from a private school returned to campus Tuesday with a gun in a guitar case and fatally shot the headmistress before committing suicide, authorities said.
No students were injured at Episcopal School of Jacksonville, Undersheriff Dwain Senterfitt said. When officers arrived, Dale Regan, head of the school, and the gunman were found dead, Senterfitt said. Regan began working as a teacher at Episcopal, which has about 900 students in grades 6-12, in 1978, according to a profile published in The Florida Times Union in 2010. She later went on to become the first woman to hold the school's top position. Also Tuesday:
A judge scheduled a hearing for April 3 to determine whether T.J. Lane, 17, will be tried as an adult in the Feb. 27 shooting rampage that left three students dead in Chardon, Ohio. Conviction in adult court could result in a life sentence. 
A 9-year-old boy in Port Orchard, Wash., who shot and critically wounded a fellow third-grader at school Feb. 22 was sentenced to 12 months of probation and ordered to write a letter of apology. Amina Kocer-Bowman, 8, remains hospitalized in serious condition.
Program will track immigrants, visas
The Department of Homeland Security will unveil within weeks a plan to track when immigrants leave the United States, a department official told a House subcommittee.
An exit system to track who is leaving the country and when has been sought since before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. DHS officials, including Secretary Janet Napolitano, have agreed with the need for such a program but have previously said it would be too costly. John Cohen, the department's deputy counterterrorism coordinator, did not discuss the cost in his Homeland Security subcommittee testimony about the problem of immigrants who overstay visas.
Eight sue military claiming sexual abuse
Eight current and former members of the military filed suit against the military alleging they were raped or harassed and suffered retaliation when they reported it to their superiors.
The lawsuit, filed in Washington, accuses the military of having a "high tolerance for sexual predators" and fostering a hostile environment that discourages victims from coming forward. Seven women claim a comrade raped or tried to sexually assault them. The eighth says she was harassed and threatened while deployed to Iraq. Defense Department spokeswoman Cynthia Smith said she could not discuss the case but said the military has no tolerance for sexual assault.
Minority kids more likely to be expelled
Hispanic and black students are more likely to be suspended, expelled or arrested than white peers, an Education Department report says.
Hispanic and African-American students make up nearly three-quarters of students involved in school-related arrests or cases handed over to police, the report said. It also found black students are more than three times as likely as their white peers to be suspended or expelled. "The sad fact is that minority students across America face much harsher discipline than non-minorities, even within the same school," Education Secretary Arne Duncan said.
Accused Manhattan madam kept in jail
A suburban mother of four charged with running a Manhattan prostitution ring was simply building a legitimate online dating service, her lawyer said.
Anna Gristina was ordered held on $2 million bail. Assistant District Attorney Charles Linehan said Gristina, 44, said she made millions of dollars arranging trysts and claimed she had law-enforcement connections who'd let her know if charges loomed. Her lawyer, Peter Gleason, said after court that Gristina was "a loving, caring mother" trying to develop her own business.

Refugees: 'There is no mercy'; 
Prisoners are tortured, rights groups say

BYLINE: Sarah Lynch, Special for USA TODAY

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 2A

LENGTH: 567 words

Dark scars on Mohammad Al-Fawari's face stand out even in the shadows of his cold, dimly lit home in a poor part of town where he and his family sought refuge near the Syrian-Jordan border.
The wounds -- a result of electric shock -- are the faded signs of torture he endured while in prison, he says. But Mohammad and his family count themselves lucky because they were able to flee Homs as it was pounded by Syrian forces. 
Thursday, United Nations humanitarian chief Valerie Amos toured the shattered Syrian city and was "struck" by the devastation.
She said in Damascus that the Baba Amr neighborhood in Homs is "completely destroyed" and deserted. Where the residents are she could not say.
In February, the regime of Bashar Assad intensified the campaign on the rebel stronghold with bombardments that killed 700 civilians, according to Human Rights Watch, citing local sources.
Since the uprising began a year ago, 8,000 Syrians have been killed across the country, the United Nations says.
U.N. chief Ban Ki Moon says he has received "grisly" reports that Assad's troops summarily executed locals, beheading them or torturing them after the rebel Free Syrian Army left.
Thousands have fled to the Lebanon border. Mohammad, 26, and his brother Ahmad Al-Fawari, a decade older, fled to Jordan with their families.
"There is no mercy," Ahmad says at the family's rented home.
Days before the brothers fled, their uncle Nizar was shot to death by a sniper while on his way to buy bread at a store.
They say he was killed because they are Sunnis who were living in an Alawite Shiite neighborhood.
"We lived together for almost 40 years, and now they are shooting us, killing us," Ahmad says of the Syrian troops, who are largely Alawite Shiite.
During their last weeks in Syria, Ahmad and Mohammad barricaded themselves and their families in their home. They left bribes in holes on outside walls to deter Assad's forces.
The power lines were cut. The family stayed warm by burning shoes and old clothes along with wood from furniture.
Mohammad says he was stopped at a checkpoint and detained without being told why and spent over a month in jail.
For 35 days, Mohammad says, he was kept in a 9-by-9-foot room with about 75 men. Trying to sleep, he was often jolted by sounds of security forces using the backs of Kalashnikov rifles to strike men in the head.
"Every 30 minutes, they came in and harassed us," he says.
Prisoners lived in a cell that had no toilet. They were fed one meal a day, an egg or potato with bread and a few teaspoons of water. Mohammad says water was poured over his head before he was electrically shocked. Some of the men had broken bones sticking out.
Family members reinforce Mohammad's story, and Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have reported similar cases of detainment, detention and torture across Syria.
More than 100 people detained in Syria were interviewed by HRW and reported "rampant use of torture in detention centers against even the youngest detainees."
Among the most common methods are electric shock, beating the soles of feet and hanging by bound wrists so toes barely touch the ground, said Nadim Houry, deputy director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch.
Mohammad was released from prison when his family negotiated his freedom by paying $4,000, which came from relatives sending money from the Gulf.

Miss. court upholds Barbour's pardons

LENGTH: 620 words

The Mississippi Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the pardons issued by Gov. Haley Barbour during his final days in office, including those of four convicted killers and a robber who had worked at the Governor's Mansion.
The court rejected Democratic state Attorney General Jim Hood's legal challenge, which was based on technical grounds. Barbour, a Republican, pardoned 198 people before finishing his second term Jan. 10.
Most of the people pardoned had served their sentences years ago, but crime victims were outraged. "I hope Haley Barbour and the Supreme Court justices can sleep at night," said Joann Martin,  whose sister was killed by one of the pardoned trusties. 
Two die in psychiatric clinic shootout
A gunman armed with two semiautomatic handguns opened fire in the lobby of a psychiatric clinic at the University of Pittsburgh, setting off a gunbattle that left him and another person dead, Mayor Luke Ravenstahl said.
Seven other people were wounded or injured, he said. Ravenstahl didn't confirm that the gunman was fatally shot by a University of Pittsburgh police officer, but he said: "Police acted admirably and did engage in gunfire."
BP payout fund turned over to court
The man who has overseen the process of paying out billions of dollars to the victims of the BP oil spill was relieved of his duties.
Judge Carl Barbier's order calls for a court-appointed administrator to take over from the Gulf Coast Claims Facility led by Kenneth Feinberg. The move is part of a proposed multibillion-dollar settlement between BP and lawyers representing more than 100,000 individuals and businesses. BP agreed to pay up to $20 billion to compensate  fishermen and others. The claims fund has  paid out more than $6 billion.
Ala. immigration law takes another hit
A federal appeals court blocked two more sections of Alabama's tough immigration law.
The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected a section that forbid Alabama courts from enforcing contracts involving illegal immigrants and another making it a felony for illegal immigrants to do business with state or local agencies. Alabama's law was challenged last year by the federal government and a coalition of activist groups, and other sections have been blocked. The court won't decide whether to completely overturn the law until the U.S. Supreme Court rules on a challenge to a similar law in Arizona.

FAA: No end in sight for higher air fares
Air fares are likely to stay high throughout this decade as passenger travel grows but airline capacity shrinks, a new federal study said.
In its annual economic analysis, the Federal Aviation Administration predicted that more airline mergers and consolidation will shrink the number of cities served and the number of flights available. Travelers won't get much relief until airlines start getting more competition.
Ex-federal prosecutor disbarred in D.C.
A court in Washington disbarred a former federal prosecutor for "egregious" misconduct in a series of high-profile murder cases.
The D.C. Court of Appeals decision -- 16 years after G. Paul Howes was first accused of authorizing improper payments to witnesses -- is the first in at least a decade to strip a federal prosecutor of his law license. A USA TODAY investigation in 2010 documented 201 cases since 1997 in which courts found that federal prosecutors violated laws or ethics rules. Only six faced any discipline from the state offices that oversee legal ethics; none was disbarred.--Brad Heath

WASHINGTON -- The House of Representatives passed and sent to the Senate a bipartisan package of bills designed to make it easier for small businesses and start-ups to raise the capital they need to grow and hire workers.

LENGTH: 631 words

The Coast Guard suspended its search Sunday for four men missing and presumed dead from a fishing trawler off the Washington coast.
Petty Officer Shawn Eggert said crews in Coast Guard cutters and a helicopter have covered more than 1,300 square miles since the 70-foot Lady Cecelia sent a distress signal early Saturday.
Eggert said the search continued beyond the time when the victims might have survived in the water. Rescue crews searched through the night after finding debris, an empty lifeboat and an oil sheen several miles off the coast. The missing men are Dave Nickels, 42; Jason Bjaranson, 38; Chris Langel, 25; and Luke Jensen, 19. 
Trial opens today in NASA bias lawsuit
Opening statements are scheduled today in Los Angeles for the trial of a discrimination lawsuit  against NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
David Coppedge, who worked as a "team lead" on the Cassini mission exploring Saturn and its many moons, claims he was discriminated against because he engaged his co-workers in conversations about intelligent design and handed out DVDs on the idea while at work. Coppedge lost his "team lead" title in 2009 and was let go last year after 15 years on the mission.
In court papers, defense lawyers  said that co-workers complained of harassment and that Coppedge had ongoing conflicts with others.
Times change for TV's 'Hour of Power'
California's Crystal Cathedral megarchurch, where a weekly prayer service at a drive-in movie theater evolved into the Hour of Power televangelist empire, will relocate to an undetermined location, the church's senior pastor said.
Sheila Schuller Coleman said the ministry will be renamed Hope Center Of Christ. The church raked in millions in donations through its Hour of Power broadcasts, but recent struggles compelled the sale of its iconic glass-paned home to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange County last month. Founder  Robert Schuller retired in 2006 and said Saturday that he will step down from the Crystal Cathedral board of directors.
Child, 7, dies after being shot by sibling
The 7-year-old daughter of a police officer in Washington state died at a Seattle hospital  after being shot by her young sibling, who found a loaded gun in the family's van, authorities said.
The shooting occurred inside the vehicle Saturday in Stanwood as the parents were nearby, Snohomish County sheriff's Lt. Brent Speyer said in a news release. Neither the officer's identity nor details about his career with the Marysville Police Department were immediately released.

Killings threaten Afghan mission; 
16 civilians slain; U.S. soldier blamed

BYLINE: Jim Michaels and Oren Dorell, USA TODAY

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 1A

LENGTH: 388 words

Allegations that an American servicemember went on a shooting spree that left at least 16 Afghan civilians dead have plunged relations between the two countries to a new low and threaten to test U.S. strategy to end the conflict. 
Investigators have yet to determine a motive for the killings. Afghan and coalition officials are bracing for waves of anger from Afghans that could further damage the relationship between coalition forces and their Afghan partners as the United States draws down its forces there.
Sunday's shooting in southern Afghanistan came after other incidents, including the inadvertent burning of Qurans at a U.S. base, that have angered Afghan civilians and government officials and touched off riots.
"The last couple of months, I've been more concerned about our ability to accomplish the mission in Afghanistan than I have in a long time," said Mark Jacobson, a former NATO official in Afghanistan  at the German Marshall Fund.
Witnesses described a scene in which a gunman walked from home to home, killing men, women and children in a nearby village. The servicemember, whose name has not been released, returned to his base and turned himself in to authorities, the coalition command said Sunday. He remains in coalition custody and will likely be tried by U.S. military authorities.
A U.S. official told the Associated Press that the soldier is from Washington state and was assigned to a remote special operations site. The official said he is  from Joint Base Lewis-McChord.  The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing.
Afghan President Hamid Karzai condemned the shootings. "This is an assassination, an intentional killing of innocent civilians and cannot be forgiven," he said.
U.S. officials tried to head off a deepening crisis. President Obama called Karzai to "express his shock and sadness," the White House said.
The shootings come at a sensitive time as the U.S. shifts its focus from combat operations to training  Afghan security forces.  "We're at a point in the conflict where we need to transition and that requires  inherent trust," Jacobson said.
Incidents like these can come to define a conflict. Photos of U.S. servicemembers  abusing prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq in 2004 helped inflame the insurgency.

Classes teach first aid for mental health; 
Non-experts can learn to help in a crisis

BYLINE: Kim Painter

SECTION: LIFE; Pg. 11B

LENGTH: 878 words

"Are you thinking of killing yourself?"
"Have you made a plan?"
"Have you thought about how you would do it?"
Esther Amagoh had just finished asking a classmate several questions like those when she raised a hand to ask one of her own: "If they answer yes to all of the questions, what do we do next?"
Suicide warning signs 
Amagoh, 24, was in the right place to find out: She was among 22 physical therapy doctoral students at Howard University in Washington, D.C., who devoted a recent afternoon to an abbreviated version of a course that prepares people to respond to others in a mental health crisis.
It's called mental health first aid. And while the classes are not yet nearly as common as traditional first aid courses -- the kind you take to learn how to help a choking victim or cardiac arrest victim -- they are catching on.
Since 2008, 50,000 people in 47 states have taken the course, and 1,850 have been trained as instructors, says Bryan Gibb, director of public education at the National Council for Community Behavioral Healthcare, based in Washington. The non-profit runs the effort, using a curriculum developed and tested in Australia. Anyone can take the 12-hour classes, which are sometimes offered in workplaces.
In April, Gibb's group will roll out a new version of the class designed for parents, teachers, counselors and others who work with people in the 10-to-20 age range.
In the past year, the course gained particular ground in Arizona: The state started offering the class to residents after a mentally ill man shot U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and 18 other people in Tucson in early 2011.
"It took place right at our Safeway, less than a mile from my church," says Mike Lange, 58, a retired lawyer who took the course and became an instructor shortly after the shooting, in which six people were killed. One of the victims was a judge whom Lange knew well.
If more people knew how to help people with mental illnesses, fewer such tragedies might occur, Lange says.
But, he says, he mostly teaches the class in hopes of spreading "more information, less stigma, more vigilance and more caring."
Learning how to respond
Attend a traditional first aid class, and you will learn checklists for assessing and responding to cuts, burns and strokes.
But at the recent class at Howard, Gibb asked the students to consider how they would "respond to someone who is apparently having a discussion with someone who is not there," a stranger having a panic attack, a friend expressing hopelessness or a client distressed over an illness.
He offered a checklist for dealing with such situations. It goes by the acronym ALGEE and has these steps:
oAssess for risk of suicide or harm.
oListen non-judgmentally.
oGive reassurance and information.
oEncourage appropriate professional help.
oEncourage self-help and other support strategies.
The students learned that when someone might be suicidal, it's best to ask direct questions -- and that using the word "suicide" won't make things worse.
"I had that misconception," said Amber Stewart, 27. "You want to be sure you are doing the right thing."
Students also learned to never leave a suicidal person alone and to get that person professional help as soon as possible.
In one exercise, they got a taste of what it's like to have a real conversation while hearing unreal voices: The students took turns whispering into the ears of chatting classmates. It's tough to concentrate, the students agreed, when a voice is saying "Don't trust him" or "Why are you talking to her?"
Those are the sorts of things that someone suffering from auditory hallucinations might endure, Gibb told them.
Knowledge reduces stigma
He also covered problems that are more common, including anxiety and substance abuse. He said mentally ill people were much more likely to be victims than perpetrators of violence, but he also showed the students how to stay safe in uncertain situations.
A brief class can't turn laypeople into psychiatrists, Gibb says. "But there's not a psychiatrist on every street corner," he adds, and with one in four people showing symptoms of a mental illness in any year, the need is great.
"In many of the cases where a tragedy happens, there were a lot of early warning signs," says Darcy Gruttadaro, who works on child and adolescent issues for the National Alliance on Mental Illness. "Programs like mental health first aid can help more people know how to approach those situations."
Knowledge also reduces the stigma, she says: "That is extremely important and impacts a lot of people."
---
Suicide warning signs
Most mental health problems are "low-intensity" events that don't require an emergency response, Bryan Gibb says. But a person making plans for suicide needs immediate help. Some possible warning signs:
Threatening to injure or kill oneself.
Seeking access to means to injure or kill oneself.
Talking or writing about death, dying or suicide.
Feeling hopeless.
Acting recklessly or engaging in risky activities.
Increased use of alcohol or drugs.
Withdrawing from friends, family or society.
Appearing agitated or angry.
Having a dramatic change in mood.
If you think someone is actively suicidal, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 800-273-TALK (8255).

Heat vs. Bulls highlights week

BYLINE: J. Michael Falgoust

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 5C

LENGTH: 649 words

Lines of the weekend
Los Angeles Clippers G Chris Paul: Season-high 36 points, 12 of 20 field goals, 11 assists, four rebounds, four steals  in a 120-108 win Friday vs. the San Antonio Spurs.
Oklahoma City Thunder G James Harden: 33 points on 11 of 16 field goals, career highs, in 29 minutes of a 122-95 win Saturday vs. the Charlotte Bobcats.
Chicago Bulls F Kyle Korver: 26 points on 10 of 16 field goals, seven rebounds and six assists, all season highs, in a 111-97 win Saturday vs. the Utah Jazz in  his fifth start. 
Best games this week
Los Angeles Lakers at Memphis Grizzlies, Tuesday: The Lakers beat the Grizzlies 90-82 at home Jan. 8 but haven't been a good road team (7-14).
Miami Heat at Chicago Bulls, Wednesday (ESPN, 9:30 p.m. ET): The Heat won 97-93 at home Jan. 29, but the Bulls didn't have injured F Luol Deng or G C.J. Watson. This week for the Bulls, Deng (left wrist), Watson (sprained left ankle) and G Richard  Hamilton (right shoulder sprain) aren't 100% and F Joakim Noah has the flu.
Spurs at Thunder, Friday (ESPN, 9:30 p.m. ET): In a clash of the West's top teams, the Spurs need a win to make up ground on the Thunder. San Antonio lost at Oklahoma City 108-96 on Jan. 8 and won at home 107-96 on Feb. 4. The Spurs are 11-9 away from home.
Teams on the cusp
Phoenix Suns: The Suns have won five of their last six with defense, holding the Clippers, Grizzlies, Dallas Mavericks, Minnesota Timberwolves and Sacramento Kings to an average of 89.2 points. Phoenix was 2 games from the West's eighth and final playoff spot entering Sunday, with the Mavericks and Portland Trail Blazers struggling and the Timberwolves devastated by the season-ending knee injury to G Ricky Rubio.
Trail Blazers: They have not won consecutive games since Jan. 24 yet were two games out of the eighth spot entering Sunday and have the firepower to get back on track. The key is whether PG Raymond  Felton can regain his footing; he has not been the same since being traded twice last season.
Milwaukee Bucks: They're right on the heels of the New York Knicks for the East's eighth playoff spot. The Bucks have a favorable schedule left: 16 of their 25 games are vs. sub-.500 teams, including the Cleveland Cavaliers three times and the Bobcats, Washington Wizards and New Jersey Nets twice apiece. And 14 are at home.
In line for a trade
Lakers: To make a strong postseason run, they need perimeter shooting from a guard who also can create off the dribble to better use 7-footers Andrew Bynum and Pau Gasol.
Bulls: With Hamilton limited by a shoulder injury for most of the season, they need another scorer to help G Derrick Rose to improve chances of getting past the Heat. Rose's occasional back problems compound matters.
Boston Celtics: They lack rebounding and need more scoring to alleviate pressure on the aging veterans. When healthy, they can still do well, but the compressed schedule will carry over into the postseason, too.
In line for No. 1 pick
Bobcats (5-34): Two seasons ago, the Bobcats won 44 games and reached the playoffs. Last season, they won 34. This season, they will struggle to win 10.
Wizards (9-30): Squint hard enough, and there are a few bright spots on the roster. In a deep draft, especially at the top, they should get another talented player to help PG John Wall.
New Orleans Hornets (10-31): They have the West's worst record. But when they dealt Paul to the Clippers, they got Minnesota's unprotected 2012 first-round draft pick. If the Timberwolves miss the playoffs, the Hornets will have two lottery picks.
Rubio: Surgery has not been set for the Minnesota rookie point guard, hurt in the final seconds of Friday's loss to the Lakers in a collision with Kobe Bryant. Rubio tweeted: "Ok, I got injured in the best moment of my career, but honestly, 2day im happy thanks to all the support Ive received. I'll come back stronger."

Snubs can't complain too loudly this March

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 3C

USA TODAY's Steve Berkowitz and Reid Cherner break down the 68-team NCAA men's tournament field:
Those who got snubbed
SB: Once again, here's who got snubbed:  nobody.
From 1985, when the tournament field expanded to 64, through 2010, no team with more than 26 victories had failed to make the field. It's taken expansion to 68 teams for Coastal Carolina to miss out with 28 wins last season and now Drexel and Oral Roberts with 27.
It's nice to see Iona in the field as an at-large selection, and it might actually make a run in the tournament. And it would have been nice to also have seen Drexel included. And, sure, Virginia Commonwealth went from a play-in game to the Final Four last season. But, seriously. Iona lost to Hofstra, which finished 10-22, and Siena, which finished 14-17. Brigham Young's best win came against Gonzaga, to which it also lost twice. One of South Florida's best wins was vs. Cincinnati, 46-45.  Colorado State was 3-9 in road games. 
These are NCAA tournament teams? Ick.
RC:  As much as I was rooting for Drexel to be included, the big boys downtown did give me Iona so I've got one of those "let's win this game for all the small schools that never had a chance to get here" teams to root for.
One small quibble: Conference champions Lamar, Vermont, Mississippi Valley State and Western Kentucky earned their tickets and deserve better than "First Four" opening-round games against each other.
Upset potential
RC:  If I was really going to reach, the games that interest me: No. 14 Belmont vs. Georgetown; No. 13 Montana vs. Wisconsin and No. 12 VCU vs. Wichita State. And while I think Kansas is a good bet for the Final Four, I don't think 15th seed Detroit will be a breeze.
Last year,  no No. 1 seeds made it to the Final Four. If I'm looking for upsets to get there this year, my picks are No. 4 Indiana, No. 5 Vanderbilt, No. 6 UNLV and No. 8 Memphis.
SB: Not sure if Mississippi Valley State beating Western Kentucky (15-18) in a play-in game qualifies as an upset. (It also would deprive the Hilltoppers a chance to play Kentucky in Louisville.) However, the Delta Devils are in after a 1-11 start. So, getting regrouped and going 20-1 is pretty impressive.
Long Beach State will need injured defensive star Larry Anderson back from a sprained knee that forced him to miss the Big West tournament, but if he's ready to go, the 49ers can take out New Mexico. Ohio has enough guys back from the team that upset Georgetown two years ago to take down Michigan. And Davidson is capable of shooting well enough to get ahead of Louisville, then using its stellar free throw shooting to seal the win.
Match game
RC: Somebody with a sense of history and a sense of humor set up the South Region. Duke's road to the Final Four could include Notre Dame, coached by former Blue Devils assistant Mike Brey, followed by UNLV, against which they have a great tournament history, and a rematch of the most twisted regional final of the them all against Kentucky.
SB: A Gael warning has been posted: Saint Mary's and Iona could meet in the final. When Harvard and Vanderbilt meet, look for Crimson fans to spend the entire game chanting, "Safety school!" In the Midwest Region final, I'd like for Kansas to meet North Carolina -- you know, just to see Ol' Roy plotz; either that, or for San Diego State and Steve Fisher to face Michigan, so a Michigan man can beat Michigan.

U.S. pledges full inquiry into killing spree in Afghanistan

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 5A

LENGTH: 416 words

The attack began around 3 a.m. Sunday. The gunman went into three houses and opened fire, said Abdul Baqi, citing accounts from neighbors. "I heard gunshots and then silence and then gunshots again," Baqi said. 
The Afghan government said a U.S. soldier killed 16 civilians after leaving his nearby base. He returned to the base and turned himself into authorities. The coalition command said a suspect is in custody.
The villages where the shootings took place -- Balandi and Alkozai -- are about 500 yards from a U.S. base and in Panjwai district, a rural suburb of Kandahar and a traditional Taliban stronghold where coalition forces have fought for control for years.
U.S. officials apologized and pledged a full investigation. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta spoke to Afghan President Hamid Karzai and offered his condolences.  "As I told President Karzai, I am fully committed to ensuring that our cooperation continues," Panetta said.
An AP photographer saw 15 bodies in the two villages caught up in the shooting. Some of the bodies had been burned, while others were covered with blankets. A young boy partially wrapped in a blanket was in the back of a minibus, dried blood crusted on his face and pooled in his ear. His loose-fitting brown pants were partly burned, revealing a leg charred by fire.
An AP photo showed the bloodstained corner of a house next to a large black area that was charred by fire. The charred area appeared to be remnants of blankets and possibly bodies that had been set on fire.
Villagers packed inside the minibus looked on with concern as a woman spoke to reporters. She pulled back a blanket to reveal the body of a smaller child wearing what appeared to be red pajamas. A third dead child lay in a pile of green blankets in the bed of a truck.
Twelve of the dead were from Balandi, said Samad Khan, a farmer who lost all 11 members of his family, including women and children.  One neighbor was also killed, he said. "This is an anti-human and anti-Islamic act," Khan said. "Nobody is allowed in any religion in the world to kill children and women."
Khan and others demanded that Karzai punish the shooter. "Otherwise, we will make a decision," Khan said. "He should be handed over to us."
The Taliban called the shootings the latest sign that international forces are working against the Afghan people. "The so-called American peacekeepers have once again quenched their thirst with the blood of innocent Afghan civilians," the Taliban said in a statement online.

Obama's support of Israel fails to instill confidence

Obama's support of Israel fails to instill confidence
I was appalled by DeWayne Wickham's column regarding Benjamin Netanyahu "injecting" himself into U.S. politics ("Israeli leader injects himself into U.S. presidential politics," The Forum, Tuesday). 
As an American Jew who has children and grandchildren living in Israel, I have seen firsthand the threat that the people of Israel face from their Middle East neighbors.
When President Obama says,  "I have Israel's back," regarding Iran to American and Israeli Jews, his words ring hollow to me. As a president who has  apologized to Muslims repeatedly, snubbed the Israeli prime minister,  and even had the audacity to suggest that Israel consider going back to its indefensible pre-1967 borders,  Obama has done nothing to earn the trust of Israelis or American Jews.
Now in an election year, he claims to be a supporter of Israel, but what will happen after he is re-elected? I hope we never have to find out.
Netanyahu is not playing politics with the Iran situation. He is doing everything in his power to protect his people from annihilation. The only person playing politics with Israel and American Jews is  Obama.

President is taking right approach
I am appalled at the Israeli prime minister's comments regarding how Iranians see the U.S. and Israel when he said:  "For them, we are you.  And you are us."  As  a U.S. citizen, I in no way feel a connection to Israel, nor do I appreciate its continued attempts to control U.S. foreign policy.
I have admired President Obama's stance distancing himself from Israel and hope he will stand firm in allowing sanctions to work against Iran. If Israel decides to bomb Iran's nuclear facilities, then our government should make it very clear that  we had  no connection to it, and we should strongly condemn the attack.
Further,  why  do we not push more strongly for a Palestinian state and strongly condemn the expansion of Israeli settlements in disputed territory? I have always wondered why this country sends billions of dollars in foreign aid to Israel  when it is a thriving and productive country.  Perhaps it is time to discontinue that and use those dollars to help citizens here.

Dissonance on gun rights
Stories on  the same page in Wednesday's edition were telling.  A Newsline item reported that a Florida headmistress was shot and killed by a fired employee (who then committed suicide),  updated us on the trial in the fatal shooting at Chardon (Ohio) High School, and reported about a 9-year-old who shot and wounded another child.
Nearby, an article "12 states on path to guns with no permits" showed how some people  want our country to be awash in guns (News). I thought I had heard all the absurdities about this issue, but this quote from New Hampshire state Rep. J.R. Hoell  tops them all:  "Gun-free zones kill people."

U.S., Britain: Is there still a 'special relationship'?; 
Cameron's U.S. visit includes a long agenda

BYLINE: Aamer Madhani, USA TODAY

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 5A

LENGTH: 742 words

As British media and political analysts question whether Britain and the U.S. have lost their "special relationship" status, President Obama is rolling out the red carpet -- literally -- and scheduling plenty of quality time with British Prime Minister David Cameron during his visit here this week.
Obama's talks with Cameron on Wednesday are expected to include the fallout from Sunday's killings of up to 16 Afghanistan civilians by a U.S. soldier. Afghanistan was already high on the leaders' agenda, including plans by the U.S. and allies to turn over security responsibilities to the Afghan government in 2014. 
Obama and Cameron plan to travel to Dayton, Ohio, on Tuesday to watch a first-round game in the NCAA college basketball tournament.
Meanwhile, first lady Michelle Obama has invited the prime minister's wife, Samantha, to take part in a mini-Olympics event with Washington-area schoolchildren -- a bit of homage to the Brits, who will be hosting the 2012 Summer Games. The two will also host a barbecue for U.S. and British troops.
On Wednesday, the president and prime minister will huddle in the Oval Office, where -- in addition to the Afghanistan War and Sunday's shooting -- they're likely to discuss Iran's suspected nuclear program,  the  precarious situation in Syria and the European financial crisis. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton will host a luncheon for Cameron, and Obama will honor him with a state dinner that night, beginning with a  red-carpet entrance at the White House.
"There's a strong working relationship, and actually even a strong personal bond, between Prime Minister Cameron and President Obama they'll cultivate during this visit and during these meetings," says Josh Earnest, deputy White House press secretary.
Cameron, 45, who leads Britain's Conservative Party, and Obama come from ideologically different traditions. Their differences are most apparent in their approaches to the global financial crisis: Obama has pushed for stimulus and slow deficit cutting, while Cameron has embraced tougher austerity measures in the United Kingdom.
Some experts who follow the Anglo-U.S. relationship say the connection between the two nations has shifted  as Britain's power globally has diminished.
"The policy elites in Britain would like to still believe there is a special relationship between the U.S. and Britain," says Mark Blyth, professor of political economy at Brown University in Providence. "The American focus has shifted toward Germany and the eurozone and away from the so-called special relationship with Britain."
On perhaps the two biggest national security questions -- Iran's nuclear program and winding down the Afghanistan War -- there's no difference in the views of  the two leaders, says Nile Gardiner, director of the Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington. Britain and the U.S. also closely coordinated their efforts in establishing a NATO-led no-fly zone over Libya and assisting rebels there last year in an operation that helped lead to the toppling of Moammar Gadhafi's regime.
Even so, Gardiner laments that the relationship has diminished from the close partnerships that Ronald Reagan and Thatcher had during the Cold War, or George W. Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair shared during the Iraq War and in the aftermath of 9/11.
"On the surface, the relations are very cordial, but behind the scenes, this is not a very close partnership," Gardiner says of Cameron and Obama.
Early in Cameron's term, Obama and the prime minister were at odds as Cameron pushed to protect the British oil company BP from excessive claims for compensation following the massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and resisted calls from U.S. lawmakers to launch an inquiry into the release by Scotland of Abdel Baset Ali Megrahi, the Libyan who was convicted in the 1988 Pan-Am flight 103 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland, which killed 270 people.
"There were some real strains in the relationship, and they had a bumpy beginning initially," says Heather Conley, Europe analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, "but clearly there was a lot of communication in Operation Unified Protector in Libya.  On Iran, they're in lockstep, and there is close coordination on Syria."
And recently, Obama named Cameron in a Time interview as one of a handful of world leaders with whom he has a "lot of trust and confidence."

Syrian forces target doctors and patients; 
No safe havens for wounded

BYLINE: Sumi Somaskanda

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 4A

LENGTH: 885 words

When the wounded protester arrived at the National Hospital in Homs, Syria, a surgeon ordered an immediate ultrasound. As the injured man was wheeled past a police captain, the officer banged the butt of his gun on the patient's knee and said he didn't deserve treatment -- and wheeled him out again.
"I looked at the doctor in the room, and he was not even daring to look at the officer," the surgeon said. 
The story is one of many recounted to Amnesty International, which has been taking videotaped testimony from doctors who say forces for President Bashar Assad have been posting troops at hospitals across the country to prevent regime opponents from getting treatment. In some cases, doctors say the troops use hospitals to identify regime opponents for execution, and they persecute medical personnel attempting to treat them.
Since the uprising began a year ago, patients have been taken away and killed, while doctors, nurses and emergency room workers have been arrested, tortured and even killed for doing their jobs, according to Doctors Without Borders and Human Rights Watch.
"In Syria today, wounded patients and doctors are pursued and risk torture and arrest at the hands of the security services," said Marie-Pierre Alli, president of Doctors Without Borders. "Medicine is being used as a weapon of persecution."
In interviews and 15 testimonies recorded by Doctors Without Borders, doctors across Syria have recounted harrowing scenes of fear, intimidation and violence as the Syrian security forces extend their control over the established health care network.
"In the hospitals now, the security cadres are more numerous than the medical personnel," a 23-year-old Syrian man said after being shot in the hand and taken to a Damascus hospital. The man's testimony was collected by Doctors Without Borders.
"Anyone is subject to arrest and even murder inside the hospital," he said, asking that he remain anonymous out of fear for his safety.
In Homs, the Syrian Network for Human Rights reported that the situation is dire for the injured: Hundreds of severely wounded civilians can't turn to hospitals; medical personnel lack medication, anesthesia, surgical equipment and in some cases, water and power to perform surgery. Also, doctors are being detained for working in field hospitals or helping bring medical supplies to the wounded. Having drugs and basic medical materials, such as gauze, is considered a crime these days, they say.
"People are being killed and there is no remedy, no treatment, no ambulances, no hospitals to treat the wounded people at all," said Walid Saffour, president of the Syrian Human Rights Committee. "Even the safe hospitals are being shelled."
Doctors Without Borders says that medical professionals whose names were withheld by the group said security services attack and destroy mobile hospitals and enter houses of doctors and nurses looking for drugs and medical supplies.
Ahmad Al-Fawari, who escaped Homs, recalled one afternoon last year when he spotted hundreds of men marching to Al-Barr Hospital there. Security forces were coming to seize the wounded as part of a large-scale military operation on Sept. 7. His account was  corroborated by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.
Along with other volunteers helping doctors and nurses treat the wounded, Al-Fawari rushed patients out three back doors and hid others in the basement next to generators. He helped nine patients escape, while security forces seized 18 patients.
Amnesty International has accused the Syrian government of "turning hospitals into instruments of repression," in a 39-page report called "Health Crisis: Syrian Government Targets the Wounded and Health Workers." In the report, the aid organization has documented dozens of cases of patients being tortured and beaten.
"Given the scale and seriousness of the injuries being sustained by people across the country, it is disturbing to find that many consider it safer to risk not having major wounds treated rather than going to proper medical facilities," said Cilina Nasser, Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa researcher.
More troubling, witnesses have told the rights groups that Assad has supporters among the doctors and nurses at major hospitals. They often refuse to treat protesters or worse, torture them, one surgeon told Amnesty in his testimony. That has forced thousands of Syrians to turn to one another for help, seeking and receiving treatment from an underground medical system.
The underground doctors still lack critical medical supplies -- especially those needed to treat serious injuries -- and the field hospitals are often not enough, activists say.
"There's no way for blood transfusions, which is a life-saving measure," said Zaher Sahloul, president of the Ohio-based Syrian American Medical Society. "Many people are literally bleeding to death  in a country where you do have a supply of blood. Unfortunately, it's controlled by the government, and there's no access to that by field clinics."
Sahloul said that he studied medicine in Syria and that it is hard to believe how the hospitals there have been manipulated.  "It's probably the only country in the world nowadays where you have systematic harassment and detention of physicians because they are performing their duties."

Civilian slaughter raises new doubts about Afghan mission

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 6A

LENGTH: 607 words

In all probability, the weekend slaughter of 16 innocent Afghans by an American soldier will turn out to have been no more preventable than last month's shooting of five Ohio high school students by a classmate.
People crack, and they kill -- the danger they pose obvious only in hindsight. Who could foresee that a staff sergeant with a wife and two kids would methodically murder nine children in their homes, then calmly return to base?
But predicting that something like this would happen some time in the course of a grinding 10-year war is another matter. Such incidents are a recurring nightmare played out in each of the long, intractable conflicts that the United States has taken on in the past 50 years, and in each case they've signaled a deeper problem: the alienation of the local population the U.S. set out to help. 
The systematic massacre of hundreds of Vietnamese villagers in 1968, at the peak of the Vietnam War, was a gruesome indicator that something had gone terribly wrong. The attempt to uproot an indigenous enemy, the Vietcong, had spun so far off track that U.S. soldiers in the field participated in  the murder of an entire village, from babies to the elderly.
Similarly, the killing of 24 unarmed men, women and children at Haditha, Iraq, in 2005 marked the frustrations of the Iraq War. Eight U.S. Marines were charged, but none was convicted of any significant crime, infuriating Iraqis and deepening enmity that eventually hastened the withdrawal of U.S. forces from a country they had come to liberate.
This weekend's shootings, and two prior incidents, are the latest indicators that the Afghanistan War  is on a troublingly similar track.
A video of U.S. troops urinating on Taliban corpses, disclosed in January, and the mindless burning of discarded Qurans by  U.S. soldiers in February enraged Afghans, who interpreted both actions as willful offenses against Islam. They were, instead, acts of ignorance, but the fact that the soldiers could be so oblivious to the damage they were doing is a measure of how deeply religious and cultural differences are hindering U.S. efforts. Subsequent revenge killings of Americans by Afghan partners raise fundamental doubts about the plan to hand off responsibilities.
How much the weekend killing spree will add to the problem remains to be seen. The slaughter wasn't immediately met with demonstrations like those that followed the Quran burnings -- perhaps because the religious component was absent, perhaps because atrocities committed by the Taliban when it was in power dwarf Sunday's carnage, or perhaps because Afghans, who've suffered grievously for two decades, are all too familiar with indiscriminate killing.
Regardless, the incidents are not reason to rush for the exits. The American goal -- to prevent the Taliban from regaining control of Afghanistan and providing al-Qaeda terrorists safe harbor from which to plot attacks against the U.S. -- has not been achieved.
Even so, the incidents are reason for President Obama to  define more sharply what success might look like, particularly given his aggressive timetable for withdrawal, which the White House reaffirmed Monday. The plan calls for a handoff of responsibility for security to Afghans by the end of 2014, with a small counterterrorism force to remain after that date, while nation-building efforts by the U.S., the U.N. and NATO nations continue.
The best option is the one the administration is trying to attain -- a negotiated settlement in which the Taliban turns on al-Qaeda and renounces global terrorism. But if 2012 continues the way it has started, a messy departure is far more likely.

Accelerate the timeline

BYLINE: Adam Smith

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 6A

LENGTH: 343 words

I have consistently said that it is time to bring our troops home as soon as we responsibly can. Our troops continue to do an outstanding job, but as recent events, such as the burning of the Quran and Sunday's shootings, have demonstrated, after 10 years of war, foreign troops in Afghanistan can serve as a destabilizing force. 
Recent successes have paved the way for a withdrawal from Afghanistan. President Obama has aggressively prosecuted the war against al-Qaeda and the Taliban. Osama Bin Laden is dead, many of al-Qaeda's senior leadership have been incapacitated, and the Taliban has been beaten back and significantly degraded.
These are significant achievements, and they have created time and space for the Afghan National Security Force to develop. At some point, full responsibility has to be turned over to the Afghan people.
It is time to bring our troops home, and, while the president has laid out a responsible path to do so, we should continue to look for every opportunity to accelerate our timeline.
Americans have paid a tremendous price, and after 10 years of war, it is time for the Afghan people to take more responsibility for their own security.
Now, this does not mean we should begin to precipitously withdraw. We still have national security interests in the region, and it is important that we work to ensure a stable Afghan government. The primary goal in Afghanistan is to prevent al-Qaeda and the Taliban from being in a position to threaten the United States and our allies. The president has put us on a realistic path to achieve that goal, and if there are opportunities to accelerate the administration's timeline, we should do so.
It has been 10 years, and the American people have paid a steep price. The Afghan people have paid a steep price. It is time to bring this war to an end as soon as we responsibly can.
Rep. Adam Smith of Washington is the ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee. His district includes Joint Base Lewis-McChord, home base of the U.S. soldier suspected of killing Afghan villagers.

How deep are these wounds?; 
had multiple deployments, called 'troubled' 'Single event' won't change course of war , anger and outrage, but relative calm

BYLINE: Tom Peter, Tom Vanden Brook

The massacre of 16 civilians in an Afghan village, allegedly by a U.S. sergeant on a rampage, is certain to test the already fragile U.S.-Afghan relationship during a critical chapter of the war.
Interviews Monday with a variety of Pentagon officials and analysts in Kabul and Washington found deep concern about the long-term implications of one of the most alarming incidents of the decade-old war. Efforts to minimize the impact came even as the sergeant accused of the killings was being interviewed by military investigators.
On Monday, Afghanistan remained relatively calm, while President Obama insisted that a single horrific incident would not push his administration off the long-term goal of winding down the U.S. combat mission in Afghanistan by the end of 2014.
The incident signals  "the importance of us transitioning, in accordance with my plan," Obama told WFTV of Orlando, "so that Afghans are taking more of the lead for their own security and we can start getting our troops home." 
As details of the killings in Panjwai, which included 11 children, dribbled out on Monday, Afghans and U.S. lawmakers pondered the motivations behind the incident and how it fits into larger questions about the American presence here.
The alleged shooter, an Army staff sergeant whose name has not yet been released, left the small Special Forces base at about 3 a.m. local time Monday, according to a Pentagon official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the incident is under investigation.  An Afghan guard saw him leave the base and reported it  but did not try to stop him, the official said. The soldier, an infantryman, belongs to a conventional unit that supports Green Berets who are training local security forces.
Villagers began bringing bodies and wounded civilians to the base within an hour, and troops realized that the missing soldier was the likely suspect. The death toll might rise from 16 because some of those wounded were in critical condition. The dead  were as young as 2, according to the official.
The alleged shooter was based at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, near Tacoma, Wash. It has had a troubled history in recent years. Last fall, three members of a Stryker brigade were convicted of participating in an alleged "kill team" that targeted Afghan civilians and collected body parts as souvenirs. The soldier did not belong to that unit, the official said.
The soldier, 38, was four months into his fourth combat deployment, his first in Afghanistan. He had seen combat during  previous tours in Iraq and had sustained a non-combat injury there. He is not speaking to investigators, the source said, and a motive is unclear, though the stress of multiple deployments may have been a factor.
Another senior Pentagon official, speaking on condition of anonymity, described the man  in custody as being "troubled" despite no obvious incidents in his military record.
Though some Afghan lawmakers were calling Monday for the soldier to be tried in Afghanistan, U.S. troops accused of wrongdoing there  are subject to U.S. military law. The military has a death penalty, but it hasn't been used since the early 1960s, military experts say. A handful of people are now on military death row. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said Monday that the death penalty might be considered in this case.
However, the job of compiling evidence capable of holding up in court may prove difficult in Afghanistan, legal experts say. "It's going to present a real challenge getting in there and getting the information," says Jeffrey Meeks, a defense attorney and retired Marine Corps judge. "You're looking at the same rules of evidence that would be used in federal court."
'An added bit of worry'
Back at Fort Lewis, Staff Sgt. Marvin Linnebur is preparing to leave March 31  for the same area where the shooting occurred. It will be his fourth deployment, too. His last tour, also in Afghanistan, was pretty calm.
The shooting "does put an added bit of worry to the deployment," he says. He calls the shooter's actions "unacceptable," as was the burning of the Qurans in Afghanistan a few weeks ago.  He expects anger from the Afghan citizens in the area.
"They won't see this as an individual act," he says. "It's just all Americans." However, he says that his unit is well-prepared and that he doesn't  "foresee anything remotely close to this happening with our unit."
The incident  raises tough questions about the wisdom of staying the course in a war that has  left 1,800 U.S. troops dead, 15,000 wounded and cost $400 billion.
Even before Sunday's incident, the president  and his advisers were reviewing plans to withdraw U.S. and allied forces while turning over security to the Afghan government by the end of 2014. The pace of the  withdrawal is one of the topics of this week's visit to Washington by British Prime Minister David Cameron.
Afghanistan also will top the agenda in May when leaders from the G-8 countries meet at Camp David and for NATO summits in Chicago. And Panetta had previously suggested that the combat mission could end sooner. But White House spokesman Jay Carney insisted on Monday that the killings will not affect the timetable.
"The pace of that withdrawal will depend on a variety of factors," Carney said.  It will not be affected by "a single event."  Carney added that the U.S. objectives  remain the same: disrupting, dismantling and  defeating al-Qaeda terrorists.
The massacre  comes weeks after Afghanistan convulsed in violence following the inadvertent burning of Qurans at a U.S. military installation. The shooting spree, as with the Qurans incident,  has been widely condemned by American officials.  The Taliban has vowed revenge for this "inhumane crime."
Obama -- who apologized to Afghanistan for the burning of Qurans  -- said Sunday that he was saddened by the incident. But the president, whom  GOP presidential contender Mitt Romney criticized for being too quick to say sorry for American action on the world stage, stopped short of apologizing for the Panjwai incident. White House officials did not respond to queries about whether an apology could be forthcoming.
On Capitol Hill, GOP lawmakers called the incident unfortunate, but urged Obama to stay the course.
"Now is not the time to abandon hope and freedom's cause, but to persevere. It has been too long since our men and women in uniform, their families and the American people have heard the president rally the American people to this cause and demonstrate the will to win," said Rep. Buck McKeon, R-Calif., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.
A muted response
U.S. and Afghan officials braced for waves of anger and protests, but the reaction so far has been  more subdued than the riots and violence that followed the Quran burnings.  Those protests  ended with almost 40 dead, including four U.S. servicemembers.
About 300 Afghan civilians staged a non-violent protest Monday in Kandahar province not far from where the shootings occurred, says Paraag Shukla, who served as a civilian intelligence officer with the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan and is now an analyst with the Institute for the Study of War in Washington.
The Quran burnings "were seen as universal, against all Muslims and against their way of life," Shukla says. "The religious insult is far more personal and touching to people not themselves located in that area" where the shooting happened.
Seth Jones, an analyst at RAND Corp., says that, while the shooting was atrocious, Afghans have grown accustomed to violence and civilian casualties after three decades of bloodshed and war. Reports of violence in a remote village might not prompt the same outrage as reports of religious desecration, some analysts say.
"I just don't think one incident in one area pulls people together like the religious issue does," Jones says. "They get used to dealing with violence."
NATO's rapid response
The speed with which NATO and U.S. officials issued statements after the incident might also have helped to contain the damage, Jones says. Allen, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, quickly issued a statement and it was followed by a call from  Obama to Afghan President Hamid Karzai. U.S. officials pledged to investigate the incident and pursue justice.
Still, Karzai condemned the attack in strong language on Sunday:  "This is an assassination, an intentional killing of innocent civilians and cannot be forgiven."
The incident at Panjwai could very well leave an indelible mark on Afghanistan. One villager, Mohammed Zahir, described cowering in fear as gunshots rang out while the soldier roamed from house to house firing on those inside. His father was wounded in the attack.
"He was walking around taking up positions in the house -- in two or three places like he was searching," Zahir told the Associated Press.
The Taliban said in a statement on its website that "sick-minded American savages" committed the "blood-soaked and inhumane crime." And the militant group promised the families of the victims that it would take revenge "for every single martyr with the help of Allah."
But some Afghans, while condemning the incident, say the action of one soldier should be kept in perspective.
"Overall, this was a really bad incident, especially looking at the photos of the kids who were killed," says Jalil Babak, an Afghan soldier stationed in Nangarhar province. "But this is a conflict, and anything can happen in war."
As the U.S. strategy in Afghanistan shifts from war fighting to small groups of U.S. troops training Afghan security forces in their communities to counter insurgent groups like the Taliban, American troops will be more isolated and vulnerable, says Anthony Cordesman, an analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
U.S. officials who want to support a continuing war effort need to educate Americans "that this is war," he says. "We're going to see incidents like this and we're also going to see that this is the new IED (improvised explosive device) for the Taliban and Haqqani network -- to push as much strife between Afghan troops and ISAF and NATO as possible."
One of the most difficult challenges for the immediate future may be controlling Afghan perception of the incident.
"America is saying they are the defenders of the human rights  but the things they are doing in Afghanistan are completely against human rights," says Abdul Rahim Ayobi, a member of parliament from Kandahar. "It finally gives us the message that now the American soldiers are out of the control of their generals."
Says Kamal Safai, a member of parliament from Kunduz: "This crime was an individual crime done by a single person. It is not the policy or strategy of Americans to kill innocent civilians. But still, the public reaction will blame the government of America, not the soldier."

Prince Harry is a hit as an ambassador; 
Tour of the Caribbean, Brazil reveals a man of the people

BYLINE: Maria Puente, USA TODAY

SECTION: LIFE; Pg. 3D

LENGTH: 568 words

After a 10-day tour of the Caribbean and Brazil as a roving ambassador for queen and country,  27-year-old Prince Harry  proved he has grown up, moved past his party-boy image and inherited from his mother, the late Princess Diana, the  ability to connect with anybody, anywhere.  The domestic and international response to the tour of Capt. Wales, as he is known in the British Army, has been overwhelmingly positive. In the hometown press, the third in line to the British throne is  being described as electrifying and an extraordinary phenomenon after charming his way into hearts in Belize, the Bahamas, Jamaica and Brazil. Here are some of the highlights:
Belize 
Harry arrives  March 2 in the tiny Central American country best known by divers for its spectacular barrier reef.  He attends a Diamond Jubilee street party, where he is photographed dancing with colorfully clad locals. He also officially renames a boulevard in honor of his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, who is celebrating 60 years on the throne this year. He climbs a Mayan temple ruin, mingles with children in an art school  and lays a wreath at a monument to British soldiers killed in service in Belize.
The Bahamas
The Caribbean country of 3,000 islands welcomes Harry enthusiastically -- especially Anastagia Pierre, 23, Miss Bahamas Universe, who tells reporters Harry is "hot" and she wants to marry him. Capt. Wales dons his sparkling white uniform and blue beret for a service in the Nassau cathedral, unveils a portrait of the queen in the main square and gives a speech before cheering Bahamians. Later, he boards a speedboat for a tour of some of the islands, but it breaks down and he is rescued by the media boat accompanying him. He also attends military exercises by island defense forces and appears before throngs at a youth rally in the national stadium.
Jamaica
The prince lines up to "race" Jamaican Olympic sprinter Usain Bolt, known as the world's fastest man, on a university track, but Harry takes off on a false start and is halfway down the track with Bolt left behind, bent over in laughter. It makes Jamaicans even wilder about Harry, who received a 21-gun salute when he arrived.  Later, he scales back his participation in military exercises after British troops are killed in Afghanistan, but he gets in some target practice and wraps up his three days in Jamaica dancing at a party at a resort beach on the north coast.
Brazil
Harry headed to South America on Friday on a mission to promote trade, sports and the London Olympics. The  prince got in plenty of outdoor activities -- sampling samba on Sugarloaf Mountain, playing rugby and volleyball on Flamengo Beach, and participating in a mock run while wearing a goofy mask of older brother Prince William. He also got to see firsthand  something young royals rarely see, the poverty of a sprawling shantytown in Rio de Janeiro. He wrapped up his stay playing in a polo match on Sunday to raise money for Brazilian charities and his African children's charity, Sentebale.
But it wasn't completely over: Harry stayed on for a few more days  on a private trip to study wetland conservation, one of the issues supported by the charitable foundation that he and his brother head.
Harry also did an interview with CBS This Morning, which will air today  and Wednesday.  In it, Harry talks about his charity work, his childhood years and his desire to be "normal."

Kansas' Robinson overcomes family tragedy

BYLINE: Steve Wieberg, USA TODAY

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 5C

LENGTH: 711 words

Word got to Kansas and Thomas Robinson on Tuesday. The Jayhawks' junior forward -- the best player in the Big 12 Conference by acclamation and no worse than a co-favorite for national player of the year honors -- had been called out.
"Robinson? I can handle Robinson," Detroit's big, brash Eli Holman spouted to the Detroit Free Press, pointing to their approaching meeting in the NCAA tournament. "He has to handle me." 
Leaning against a wall outside the  locker room, Robinson simply smiled. "He's confident. That's good," he said,  barely above a whisper. "We'll see."
He understands a challenge. That hardly qualifies.
This time a year ago, Robinson was playing out a season wrought by personal tragedy. In late December, he wept after the death of his beloved grandmother. In the middle of January, he lost his grandfather. Five days after that, his mother, Lisa, died of a heart attack at 43.
She left, besides her son, his 7-year-old sister, Jayla. Two nights after the funeral in Washington, D.C., Robinson was back in uniform, scoring 17 points and pulling down nine rebounds in an emotionally charged victory at home vs. Kansas State.
He was coming off the Jayhawks bench then. Robinson had joined a Kansas program in 2009 that was flush with NBA-bound big men -- Cole Aldrich and the Morris twins, Marcus and Markieff -- and in little immediate need of another. He played just a little more than seven minutes a game as a freshman and served as KU's sixth man in all but a couple of games as a sophomore.
Now, he's the cornerstone of a 27-6 team that won the Big 12 Conference's regular-season championship by two games and earned a No. 2 seed in the NCAA tournament's Midwest Regional. Robinson and Kansas open Friday night vs. Detroit.
Robinson's statistical contribution: 17.9 points and 11.8 rebounds a game,  the only Big 12 player averaging a double-double. He's shooting 53% from the field despite double-teams and other ratcheted-up attention from opposing teams.
"It's not official yet. But if he's a first-team All-American, he's going to get his number hung in the rafters. And he's going to be a lottery pick," KU coach Bill Self said. "Those are pretty proud moments, considering where he came from as a recruited athlete, all the stuff he's endured as a man and how far he's he progressed in both (respects)."
In nine seasons, Self has ushered a parade of stars through his program, including Wayne Simien, Brandon Rush, Aldrich, Sherron Collins and the Morris brothers.
"Place in the heart," he said of Robinson, "he's going to be right at the very top. There's no question."
Danny Manning merits a fair share of credit for Robinson's explosion from 7.6-point, 6.4-rebound performer to impact player. The former KU All-American and current assistant coach works with the Jayhawks' big men and has helped Robinson refine his footwork, find and use angles and create ways to score.
It didn't hurt that, while Robinson sat behind 6-11 Aldrich and the Morris brothers, he faced them daily in practice.
"There are not a lot of guys," Manning said, "who put themselves in that situation in terms of coming to a school that has three players who end up being first-round picks. He met it head-on. (He) obviously didn't play as much as he would like his freshman year or his sophomore year, but he stayed after it. And last summer, he worked extremely hard.
"It's his time, it's his opportunity and he's making the most of it."
The national player of the year race has come down to Robinson and Kentucky freshman Anthony Davis, the expected overall top pick in the NBA draft.
Fourteen months after Robinson's  heartbreak -- his younger sister is living in Washington with her father, James Paris -- Manning says he sees a much more focused player. Robinson affirmed that: "I feel like I have a deeper purpose to play for."
Beyond that, he declined to speak about his personal life.
There are times, Self said, when it's obvious he carries sorrow. "I don't know that he's through it," Self said.
It only deepens the coach's admiration. "Life's full of twists and turns and, to me, the key is somehow taking negatives and spinning them into positives," Self said. "I don't see how you can spin a tragedy like he's had into positives. But he's done it if it's possible."

Afghans seek to try soldier in killings; 
U.S. military says it has probable cause against American

BYLINE: Tom A. Peter, Special for USA TODAY

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 7A

LENGTH: 667 words

Some Afghans are demanding its government forge a new pact that allows U.S. servicemembers accused of crimes to be tried by Afghan courts as the U.S. military on Tuesday said it found probable cause against a soldier accused of murdering 16 civilians.
Col. Gary Kolb, a spokesman for the U.S.-led military coalition in Kabul, said that a 48-hour probable cause assessment was completed and that the servicemember continued to be confined. 
President Obama said the U.S. strategy in Afghanistan will not change in light of the killings.
"The United States takes this as seriously as if it was our own citizens and our own children who were murdered," Obama said in Washington.
The soldier, who has not been named, could face the death penalty if found guilty in a court-martial of  gunning down the civilians, including nine children, in two villages of Kandahar province before dawn Sunday.
There have been few demonstrations against the United States over the killings, but hundreds of students protested on Tuesday in Jalalabad, a city in eastern Afghanistan where extremists have a greater presence. The protests were peaceful.
At Nangarhar University in eastern Afghanistan, demonstrators led chants of, "Do not sign the strategic agreement with America."
"The reason we are protesting is because of the killing of innocent children and other civilians by this tyrant U.S. soldier," said Sardar Wali, a university student. "We want the United Nations and the Afghan government to publicly try this guy."
Afghan and U.S. officials have been in negotiations over such an agreement for months. Among the issues being discussed is whether the United States will maintain bases in the country to ensure stability beyond a withdrawal of U.S. combat forces. There are about 90,000 U.S. servicemembers in Afghanistan, and President Obama wants them to depart by the end of 2014 if conditions are secure.
Many Afghans do not oppose bases but want strict conditions on U.S. troops, such as a requirement that servicemembers accused of crimes should be tried in Afghanistan. U.S. servicemembers in Afghanistan are held accountable by U.S. military law, and those accused of wrongdoing face legal proceedings inside the military justice system, to protect them from unfair prosecutions in a country they have been ordered to defend.
Such status of forces agreements (the United States is party to about 100) do sometimes allow a host nation to take custody of servicemembers and try them for serious crimes.
"This issue should also be inked in the strategic partnership with Americans," says Rohullah Qarizada, head of the Afghan Bar Association. "Not just now or in the future, but all along they should have been brought to justice in Afghanistan when they committed crimes. I think they must do it in the future, 100%."
Members of the Afghan parliament have called for the soldier accused in the Kandahar killings to be prosecuted inside Afghanistan. "Even now, people are asking for the prosecution of this man in Afghanistan, and I would say he should be prosecuted in Kandahar," says Malalai Ishaqzai, a former parliament member from Kandahar.
U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta has said that the accused soldier could face capital punishment, but Panetta did not indicate that the soldier would not be returned to the United States for trial. "I can assure the American people and the Afghan people that we will follow the facts wherever they lead us, and we will make sure that anybody who was involved is held fully accountable with the full force of the law," Panetta said.
A delegation of top Afghan officials investigating the killings who visited the village where they occurred were fired on by insurgents. The shooting in Balandi began as Qayum and Shah Wali Karzai, two brothers of Afghan President Hamid Karzai, left a memorial service for the victims. Karzai's brothers and other top Afghan officials in their delegation escaped in their cars unharmed from the ambush.

Va. Tech found liable in massacre; 
Jury awards two families $4M each

BYLINE: Donna Leinwand, USA TODAY

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 461 words

Virginia Tech's failure to promptly notify the campus that two people had been fatally shot in a dorm led to the deaths of 30 others in the 2007 massacre, a jury found Wednesday. 
The parents of slain students Erin Peterson, 18, and Julia Pryde, 23, sued the university for wrongful death, arguing that the school's decision to wait more than two hours before sending a campuswide alert about the dorm shooting left students and staff vulnerable to attack on April 16, 2007. The initial alert did not indicate that a gunman might still be at large.
The first warning of a gunman on the loose came 10 minutes after Virginia Tech senior Seung Hui Cho had chained the doors of Norris Hall shut and began shooting students and professors in their classrooms.
The jury found the school negligent and awarded $4 million to each family. The state asked the court Wednesday for a reduction in the judgment to $100,000 per family, said Brian Gottstein, spokesman for the Virginia attorney general's office, which represented the university in court. The Virginia Tort Claims Act limits awards against the state to $100,000, he said.
Families of most of the other victims have accepted shares of an $11 million settlement from the state.
"Today we got what we wanted," Peterson's mother Celeste Peterson said after the verdict. "The truth is out there, and that's all we ever wanted. We came here for the truth."
Virginia Tech has insisted it acted properly on the information it had at the time. Campus police initially believed the students killed in the West Ambler Johnston dorm had been shot by an angry boyfriend. "Only with hindsight can one conclude that Cho's unprecedented acts were foreseeable," Gottstein said.
Virginia Tech President Charles Steger said he delayed the warning to avoid panic and give university officials time to notify the victims' parents.
"We do not believe that evidence presented at trial relative to the murders in West Ambler Johnston created an increased danger to the campus that day," Virginia Tech spokesman Mark Owczarski said in a statement. "The heinous crimes committed by Seung-Hui Cho were an unprecedented act of violence that no one could have foreseen."
Federal and state authorities have also found fault with Virginia Tech's response. The U.S. Department of Education fined Virginia Tech $55,000, the highest amount the federal government can levy under the Clery Act, for failing to issue a timely warning. Virginia Tech has appealed the fine.
In the five years since, the university has overhauled its notification system. Classrooms now have electronic bulletin boards that flash emergency messages, and the university now sends alerts that can reach students and staff on their phones and computers.

Despite burdens, Nazareth carries on

BYLINE: Jim Halley, USA TODAY

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 16C

LENGTH: 531 words

While Lauren Best has been teaching the girls at Nazareth Regional High in Brooklyn, N.Y., about basketball, they've been teaching her about rebounding, but not the kind on a basketball court.
In September, Nazareth's players lost a former teammate, Tayshana "Chicken" Murphy, to a shooting in Harlem.
At the start of the season, the school was investigated by the New York Catholic High School Athletic Association for the second time in two years because of eligibility issues. Ultimately, three out-of-state transfers were allowed to join the team. 
In January, then-head coach Apache Paschall, Best's  fianc, who was receiving chemotherapy for skin cancer, died at 38 of a heart attack.
Last month, the school's board of trustees said Nazareth would close at the end of the school year.
Amid all that difficulty, the Lady Kingsmen (18-3), No.18 in the USA TODAY Super 25  rankings, won the New York Catholic schools  title and will compete next week for the state federation title. The boys team also won the state Catholic schools title and will compete for a federation title.
"It's hard," said Best, who is  co-head coach with Ron Kelly. "The kids give us our strength. They're my inspiration. It will never be the same coaching again -- Apache and I went through everything together, but I knew what he and I wanted for these girls, and the girls give me the focus and my strength."
Paschall, who also ran a successful AAU program, Exodus, often was criticized for his recruiting tactics, especially after he was able to bring most of his players from St. Michael's Academy in Manhattan to Nazareth when St. Michael's closed in 2010. But what Best and his players remember him for is developing a family atmosphere.
"He was dad and I was mom," Best said. "We're a family, and it's bigger than just basketball for us. Our kids are very tough. They come from rough backgrounds. Anything can happen when they go home. That was  a constant worry. These kids play 10 months out of the year together. Because of everything we've been through, we feel like all we have is each other."
Guard Darius Faulk, one of three seniors on the team, has signed with West Virginia. She won a state federation title in 2009 as a freshman at St. Michael's and another last year at Nazareth. Faulk gets up at 5:30 a.m. to car-pool from Hempstead, Long Island, to  start  the school day at 8 at Nazareth in the East Flatbush section of Brooklyn.
"It's been one of the toughest years of my high school career, but I think it made me a better player overall, seeing how strong our team is, how we can work through things together," Faulk said. "We're probably one of the closest teams ever. They're who I tell all my problems to."
The school, which opened in 1962, has former NBA coach Mike Dunleavy and actor William Forsythe among its alumni. According to its  board of trustees, Nazareth has  311 students, down from  602 in 2006.
"The closing is a thought in the back of our minds, but we want to focus on winning," Best said. "Ideally, next year, we want to keep the girls together, and if Ron and I can go too, that would be the greatest blessing.
"I hope that our angel Apache is working his magic somewhere."

Classes to be held on anniversary

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 324 words

Students at Virginia Tech will do something they haven't done since the massacre on campus five years ago -- go to class on the anniversary of the killings. 
Classes on April 16 will be an important milestone after student gunman Seung Hui Cho killed 32 people and himself on the Blacksburg campus in 2007, the deadliest mass school shooting in modern U.S. history.
The five-year mark is "a turning point" with a new generation of students on campus, says Edward Spencer,  vice president for student affairs.
"Time is a great healer," Spencer says. "You don't ever totally heal. But time helps some."
The university will continue to plan events commemorating the tragedy, such as a 3.2-mile Run in Remembrance of the 32 victims killed and a candle-lighting ceremony. Students will be expected to attend their daily classes -- a turnaround from past years when classes were suspended for the day.
Resuming classes is a step forward for the university, says David Schonfeld, director of the National Center for School Crisis and Bereavement.
"Schools should try to limit the amount of cancellations," he says. "Resume classes and be flexible in what the expectations are. Acknowledge what has happened but do it in a way that helps students heal."
How schools and institutions deal with the grief after horrific events is a matter of debate. Some schools that have their names etched in infamy have chosen not to resume full classes -- even decades later:
Columbine High School in Colorado has not held classes on April 20 since 1999, when two teenagers killed 12 students, one teacher and themselves.
Each May 4, Kent State takes a recess between noon and 2 p.m. -- the time in 1970 when Ohio National Guardsmen fired into a crowd of student demonstrators, killing four.
Northern Illinois University students are excused from classes at 3 p.m., on Feb. 14, the anniversary of a 2008 shooting in which a gunman opened fire and killed five including himself.

U.S. mission in Afghanistan has remote chance of success

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 11A

LENGTH: 471 words

Just when Americans  thought  they had seen  all the atrocities in the 10-year war in Afghanistan, the shooting of 16 civilians (nine  children) by a U.S. soldier  shocks us ("Civilian slaughter raises new doubts about Afghan mission," Our view, Afghanistan debate, Tuesday). 
These senseless wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have created a hatred toward Americans that might never  disappear. In addition, corrupt  governments, other acts by the U.S. military such as the burning of Qurans,  and a U.S. foreign policy that relies on military force make the chances of success -- leaving Afghanistan with a stable government, free of Taliban control -- remote.
It is an understandable policy to support  a legitimate government or opposition  to a corrupt one with economic, medical and even military aid.  But to put American men and women on the ground without a prayer of achieving a military victory  is irresponsible. Shame on our government for its arrogance and for its repeated failure to learn from  mistakes.
Terry Friedlander
Ketchum, Idaho
Repeated deployments are an issue
Perhaps the problem is not so much with the individual soldier who committed the  egregious act  of  killing  16 Afghan civilians,  but more  with the system that continually sends America's finest on deployment after deployment  seeming in  disregard  an individual soldier's welfare.
Is our military so depleted of combat troops that it is forced to keep putting the lives of our young men and women in harm's way? If so, then we should not be fighting this or any other war.
The fault lies not with this one soldier, but with the military leadership and  system that evaluates and encourages reassignment to successive tours of combat.  The president, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and secretary of the Army  should be held equally accountable and  reprimanded.
Three tours in Iraq and then the  fourth in Afghanistan are  too much to ask of any one person, not to mention  an individual with a brain injury.
John Lemandri
Williamsburg, Va.
Don't overlook progress achieved
While the killing of innocent Afghanistan civilians is deplorable, why have one deranged soldier's actions been on all the front pages and the top news story on the networks? It seems as if nearly every week for the past  10 years, a  suicide bomber killed or maimed dozens of innocent civilian and/or military bystanders, and the reports by the news media rated  second-tier coverage at best.
A soldier in a "tinder box" of war with four tours of duty is a tragedy waiting to happen. Death is  part of the atrocities of war. We, the United States, have lost thousands of troops in these wars. Why is this nightmare so magnified, underscoring all the positive humanitarian efforts our troops have accomplished, and the U.S. lives lost since 2001?

Judd's 'Missing' is all scenery, no suspense; 
Viewers might be ones who escape

BYLINE: Robert Bianco

SECTION: LIFE; Pg. 7B

LENGTH: 409 words

Missing
ABC, tonight, 8 ET/PT
** out of four
Think of it as "One Mean Mother," or "Ashley Judd Has Her Run of Europe."
While watching Missing (ABC, Thursday, 8 p.m. ET/PT; ** out of four) may lead you to question Judd's judgment when it comes to scripts, when it comes to location shoots her tastes are clearly impeccable. Cast as ex-CIA agent Becca Winstone, a single mother on the hunt for her kidnapped son, Judd is on the run though many of Europe's most beautiful cities -- dashing through Rome, Paris, Berlin and Dubrovnik in just the first four episodes. 
But it's not all hoofing and heavy breathing. In between the scattered dialogue and occasional crying jag, Becca sees all sorts of action. There are explosions, motorcycle chases, gunfights, hand-to-hand combat and narrow escapes aplenty.
Which leads to another question. Shouldn't a woman who, we're told, has "basically spent the last 10 years in the PTA" have a bit more trouble getting back into the spy game? Five minutes after finding out her son is missing in Rome, she's right back in the swim of things: re-earthing old contacts, hacking into security cameras, shouting down CIA superiors and disposing of bad guys.
Unfortunately for Missing, a supremely silly series that takes itself incredibly seriously, her skill set is one of many reasons that the show is virtually suspense-free, the others being that most adult viewers will have seen all the movies it cribs from. Let's just say that no matter how fast Becca runs, most of the time you'll still be ahead of her.
Becca is not alone in her search for her son, Michael (nicely played by Nick Eversman). She has an old friend from Interpol (Adriano Giannini) and a new ally from the CIA (Cliff Curtis). She also has the occasional aid of a retired CIA agent (the always welcome Keith Carradine), who mentored her and her husband (Sean Bean) -- who is presumed dead by Becca, if not by many in the viewing public.
Judd is certainly a game action star. But like many Hollywood stars her age, male and female, a certain plasticity has seeped in that damages both the character and her abilities as an actor. Whether through natural or artificial means, her face often appears to be immobile. And beyond the distractions, which include wondering how it can be possible that Becca has fewer wrinkles than her son, it limits her performance range.
The scenery is pretty, though, and it's not supposed to move. You'll have to decide if that's enough.

U.S. military flies shooting suspect out of Afghanistan

LENGTH: 335 words

The U.S. military flew the soldier suspected of killing 16 Afghan villagers to another country Wednesday for long-term detention, a Pentagon official said.
The Army staff sergeant, who has not been named or charged, was transferred from Afghanistan because there are no U.S. jails there that meet military code for long-term stays, Navy Capt. John Kirby said. 
The soldier was flown to Kuwait, the Associated Press reported Wednesday night, citing a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.
Afghan officials were briefed and consulted on the military's reasoning for moving the suspect, Kirby said.
Military officials said they believe the suspect  acted alone when he went on a shooting rampage Sunday in a rural village near a small U.S. outpost, Kirby said.
Five Afghan civilians remain hospitalized from  wounds, he said.
Army investigators rushed to gather evidence at the scene of the shooting in a rural district outside Kandahar.
The soldier was stationed at an outpost whose mission was to support "village stabilization operations," a program designed to organize townsmen into self-defense groups and help with development projects.
Afghan lawmakers had demanded that the soldier be  tried in Afghanistan to show  he was being brought to justice, calling on President Hamid Karzai to suspend all talks with the U.S. about a long-term military presence here until that happens.
The alliance between Afghanistan and the U.S. military already appeared near the breaking point last month when the burning of Qurans  at a U.S. base sparked protests and retaliatory attacks that killed more than 30 people, including six U.S. servicemembers.
U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta arrived in Afghanistan on Wednesday as a bizarre incident happened at the airport. An Afghan driver somehow caught on fire  when he crashed a stolen truck as Panetta's plane was landing nearby, officials said. No one in Panetta's party was hurt, Kirby said.

U.S., Britain urge China, Russia to denounce Syria's Assad; 
Obama again says no to military action

BYLINE: Aamer Madhani, USA TODAY

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 6A

LENGTH: 544 words

President Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron renewed their call Wednesday for Russia and China to join the other United Nations  Security Council member countries in condemning the violent crackdown against opponents of Bashar Assad's regime in Syria.
The two called on the international community to support U.N. special envoy Kofi Annan as he makes his case to Russia and China that it's in  their interest to condemn Assad. 
"That's the most important thing we can do right now," Obama said at a news conference with Cameron.
The president again resisted calls for U.S. military action to stop the bloodshed in the  conflict that  has left at least 7,500 dead.
Both Russia and China have balked at Security Council measures aimed at Assad, saying  opposition forces also must be pressured to stop fighting.
Cameron suggested that Russia could be open to persuasion in light of the specter of the "bloodied, broken, brutal regime butchering people nightly on the television screens."
"It's going to take a lot of hard work, it's going to take a lot of patient diplomacy, but I think it's actually in Russia's interests that we deal with this problem," Cameron said.
The two leaders met for about an hour of one-on-one talks before being joined by aides.
Beyond the situation in Syria, the two sides discussed strategy for winding down the 10-year-old war in Afghanistan, preventing Iran from becoming a nuclear-armed country and the U.S. and Britain's economies.
While the situation in Afghanistan has been  complicated by Sunday's massacre of 16 civilians  allegedly gunned down by a U.S. soldier and the  burning of Qurans at a U.S. military base, Obama seemed reluctant to speed  up the withdrawal of troops.
Presently, 23,000 Americans are scheduled to leave by September, and the United States is scheduled to end its combat role by the end of 2014.
"I don't anticipate at this stage that we're going to be making any sudden additional changes to the plan that we currently have," Obama said.
On Iran, Obama and Cameron were in lock step, saying that there is  a window for diplomacy and sanctions to persuade Iran to abandon its nuclear program. That position  collides with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's view that the situation is more dire. Still, Obama was less sanguine that efforts by the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and Germany to restart talks with Tehran will prove fruitful.
"There's been a tendency for Iran in these negotiations  to delay, to stall, to do a lot of talking but not actually move the ball forward," Obama said.
At a formal welcoming ceremony at the White House, Obama made light of the fact that  British soldiers burned the White House during the War of 1812. Cameron, tongue firmly in cheek, apologized.
"I am a little embarrassed, as I stand here, to think that 200 years ago my ancestors tried to burn this place down," Cameron said. "Now, looking around me, I can see you've got the place a little better defended today. You're clearly not taking any risks with the Brits this time."
Cameron, who joined Obama for an NCAA college basketball game Tuesday in Dayton, Ohio,  was honored with a state dinner Wednesday night. Among the guests were actor George Clooney and Vogue editor Anna Wintour.

Reign over, UConn's future cloudy; 
Defending champs flop; end of Calhoun era near?

BYLINE: Mike Lopresti, USA TODAY

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 5C

LENGTH: 651 words

The king of college basketball is dead, and now you wonder about the enigma that is Connecticut.
The defending national champion's title-defense hopes had to be swept up with a whisk broom Thursday. You see what happened, the Huskies taken apart early and losing 77-64 to Iowa State, and you wonder if this is the end of an empire.
You wonder how the dive can be so steep, to a 20-14 record, not a year removed from blowing past Butler for the national championship. Last spring, Connecticut was steel. Thursday, at least in the first half when they fell behind 22 points, the Huskies were glass. 
You wonder about the shaky health of the legendary coach and the wobbly repute of his program. A one-year hiatus from the NCAA tournament, because of poor academics, could be coming. You wonder when Connecticut gets back to the business of March.
You wonder, with sanctions on the horizon, how many underclassmen will try to use the NBA as a life raft off a foundering cruise ship. And if Connecticut is headed not so much for the bottom of the standings but the barren land of irrelevance.
Mostly, you wonder about Jim Calhoun, and if Thursday was not just another NCAA tournament loss. You wonder if it was sunset for a man with three national titles who turns 70 soon.
Here was the first bad sign Thursday for Connecticut. It took Calhoun 82 seconds to call his first timeout, alarmed about two open Iowa State layups. He had used three barely 11 minutes into game. By then, the Huskies trailed 34-14.
The Iowa State lead was still 15 in the second half when Connecticut rallied within 58-52 with 8:26 left. But the Cyclones (23-10) regrouped to put it away.
Chris Allen led four Iowa State players in double figures with 20 points.
So Connecticut faces a worrisome future. Iowa State faces South Regional top seed Kentucky on Saturday. Speaking of worrisome
Murray State 58, Colorado State 41
The No. 6 seed Racers (31-1) went on an 18-2 run to start the second half to advance to a West Regional matchup with No. 3 Marquette.
If Murray State beats Marquette on Saturday, it would reach the Sweet 16 for the first time. This isn't like 2010, when the Racers happily upset No.4 Vanderbilt on a last-second shot and almost knocked off No.5 Butler.
"We came into the tournament expecting to win," first-year coach Steve Prohm said. "We're a No.6 seed. And we're expected to win. And now we're coming into this next game with the mind-set of trying to get to Phoenix. That's our goal. Anything less is a disappointment."
Perhaps it's a sign of how good the Racers are that they won despite producing their second-lowest point total this season, shooting 39.2% from the field and 13-for-26 from the free throw line and being outrebounded 40-32.
They trailed 24-23 at halftime. With their normally efficient offense wheezing, they turned to defense.
The Racers opened the second half with a 7-0 run ignited by a dunk from Isaiah Canaan (15points).
Marquette 88, BYU 68
Jae Crowder had 25 points and 16 rebounds, Darius Johnson-Odom scored 12 of his 20 points in the second half and the third-seeded Golden Eagles (26-7) withstood another Cougars rally to win their West Regional opener.
Brandon Davies had 19 points and 12 rebounds for the 14th-seeded Cougars (26-9), who looked for a brief while as if they might have a chance to top their historic comeback Tuesday against Iona in the First Four.
Kentucky 81, Western Kentucky 66
Terrence Jones had 22 points and 10 rebounds and Doron Lamb scored 16 as the top-seeded Wildcats (33-2) began the quest for an eighth national title with a South Regional victory.
Freshman Anthony Davis had 16 points, nine rebounds and seven blocks for Kentucky, which was never seriously threatened.
Western Kentucky (16-19) saw its  seven-game winning streak end. Freshman T.J. Price scored 16 of his career-high 21 points in the first half.

UNC's Williams 'not convinced' injured Henson's ready

BYLINE: Andy Gardiner, USA TODAY

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 7C

LENGTH: 300 words

Injured North Carolina center John Henson's availability for  today's Midwest Regional game against Vermont will be a game-time decision, coach Roy Williams said Thursday after the Tar Heels practiced at Greensboro Coliseum. 
"I am not leaning in any direction. To be extremely honest, I do not know," Williams said. "This has two parts: He has to feel comfortable that he can contribute, and I have to feel he can be effective.  I am not convinced (Henson is ready)."
Henson, a 6-11 junior, sprained his left (shooting) wrist after taking a hard foul during a game against Maryland in the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament. Without Henson, who averages 13.8 points, 10.1 rebounds and 2.9 blocked shots, UNC went on to defeat Maryland and North Carolina State before losing to Florida State in the ACC title game.
Henson participated in Thursday's practice but was limited.
Kelly limited: Ryan Kelly, Duke's 6-11 big man with three-point shooting range, will play limited minutes in a South Regional game against Lehigh as he recovers from a sprained right foot suffered in practice before the ACC tournament.
Kelly averages 11.8 points and 5.4 rebounds and is 40-for-98 from beyond the arc but will not be in a  regular rotation against the Mountain Hawks.
"He might be available for some spot duty and we'll know more about that (today)," coach Mike Krzyzewski said.
Stansbury gone: Mississippi State coach Rick Stansbury, 52, announced his retirement in an emotional news conference Thursday.
The announcement came two days after Mississippi State (21-12) lost to  Massachusetts in the first round of the NIT, ending one of the program's most disappointing seasons in recent years and perhaps the biggest collapse in Stansbury's 14 seasons as Bulldogs coach.

What should next steps be for U.S. in Afghanistan?

SECTION: EDIT; Pg. 14A

LENGTH: 213 words

We asked readers on Twitter and Facebook what they thought about a U.S. soldier allegedly killing 16 Afghan civilians.  Comments are edited for clarity: 
This shooting brings shame to the U.S.  and adds fuel to the fire.
-- @BarbaraDarlin
Targeting innocent lives, especially children, is unacceptable.  The suspect should be handed over to the court system for processing.
-- @gadget13
It tells us we need to be out sooner than planned. U.S. has nothing to gain by being there.
-- @MSSGRP
The image of the USA is already very negative in Afghanistan and its neighbors, but this incident really makes it  worse.
-- @salmanaliawan
The Afghan people need to understand that  numerous deployments  have a significant impact on  a soldier's psychological well-being.  Evaluation of soldiers before  deployments is crucial.  The chain of command has to know when to rule a soldier unfit to serve.
-- Sonja Kennedy; Mansfield, Texas
This soldier was diagnosed with a mild traumatic brain injury  after his vehicle overturned in Iraq.  He should not have been able to return to duty in this state of mind.  The U.S.  military  must remain in Afghanistan until 2014,  or the people will  be defenseless.

Afghans stage protest over U.S. soldier's removal; 
Massacre suspect taken to Kuwait

BYLINE: Tom A. Peter, Special for USA TODAY

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 7A

LENGTH: 383 words

Afghans in restive parts of the country Thursday protested the removal of a U.S. soldier accused of killing 16 civilians while others said it will not cause problems if justice is served. 
Meanwhile, President Hamid Karzai on Thursday demanded NATO troops pull out of rural areas like the one where the massacre happened. However, he has no authority to make such a move and the U.S. military maintains the village outposts are critical to keeping the Taliban out of cleared areas.
The Taliban on Thursday said it was suspending talks with the United States, though such talks were preliminary and the Taliban has thus far refused a main demand that it recognize the Karzai government for talks to proceed further.
The soldier, who has not been named, was flown to a U.S. military facility in Kuwait.
Several hundred people in the southern Afghan province of Zabul on Thursday protested the soldier's removal. Afghans have staged peaceful protests since the shootings were revealed, and the country has yet to see  major demonstrations such as those that followed the accidental burning of Qurans on a U.S. military base last month.
Some Afghans say the suspect's transfer may not cause any problems if the United States is open and transparent with the case and subsequent legal proceedings.
"This is an act that cannot be justified in any way, in any context, and it has to be addressed," said Barry Salaam, an independent Afghanistan analyst and civil society activist in Kabul. "As long as he gets the punishment that he deserves, I think that taking him out of Afghanistan will not have a big impact. But if taking him out of Afghanistan affects the way he gets punished and the punishment he deserves, then it would be an issue."
Mirwais Yasini, a member of parliament from Nangarhar province, said it's too early to determine how Afghans will react. News often travels slowly here, and demonstrations usually take place after Friday prayers, he noted.
Yasini reiterated calls for an open trial to avoid any potential problems going ahead.
"If there is a trial, even by a military court, it has to be publicized if it's in Kuwait," he said. "If they take it to the U.S., that will further complicate the issue, but let's do it carefully. If not in Kuwait, then in the U.S., but it has to be an open trial."

Syrians remain resolute in fight for freedom; 
Revolution turns a year old

BYLINE: Ruby Russell, Jabeen Bhatti

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 7A

LENGTH: 935 words

One year ago, a group of schoolchildren scrawled graffiti on school walls in the small city of Daraa. Excited over the uprisings in Egypt and elsewhere known as the Arab Spring, the boys wrote, "The people want the overthrow of the regime."
The boys, who ranged in age from 10 to 15, were whisked away by the security forces of President Bashar Assad and beaten terribly. Some even had their fingernails pulled out by their tormentors. 
The people of Daraa were outraged and mobbed streets in protest, the customary way in which many in the Arab world communicate with their dictatorial leaders.
This time it was different: Anger over one incident in one city spread to other cities rife with  abuse, torture and repression under four decades of dictatorship. The outrage may have lost momentum eventually, if not for what Assad did in response.
"It was a shock," said Omar Al Muqdad, an activist and journalist from Daraa. "They surprised us when they opened fire on the unarmed people in the streets. And really for the first three days it seemed like a nightmare."
One year later, the protests have hardened into a revolution that borders on  civil war, making this uprising by far the bloodiest to emerge from the Arab Spring as army deserters have joined forces with civilians to topple the Assad regime. Assad says the opponents are thugs and terrorists and has refused international calls to end the violence.
The death toll has reached more than 8,000 dead, according to the United Nations, as Assad's forces use their exclusive possession of artillery and tank shells to pummel opponents armed largely with rifles. Torture and imprisonment are widespread against opponents and those who try to help them, say groups such as Amnesty International and Doctors Without Borders.
And yet, the opponents show little sign of backing down.
"When (Assad) put down Daraa, Hama erupted," said Syrian activist Abdul Omar from the United Kingdom. "When he put down Hama, Homs erupted; when Homs was put down, Damascus moved, and Idlib and so on. Legitimately, there was a heavy need for reform.
"But when people called for reform and were answered with tanks, they realized what we need is more than just reform: We need a complete change," he explained.
Syria analysts say it is the violence unleashed against opponents that has stiffened their resolve.
"Despite everything that has happened, the killing, the torture, the incarceration, Syrians are still on the street every day," said Fawaz Gerges, director of the Middle East Center at the London School of Economics. "A psychological rupture has taken place in Syria whereby people are willing to die and they will continue to die in order to achieve freedom and dignity."
Activists say it is also impossible now to accept Assad's rule after what he has done to his people. Opponents know they are doomed if they back down now, so they may as well fight, activists say. "If the people go back and live obediently, they know it's only a matter of time before their front door is knocked down and they are arrested, thrown in jail, raped, tortured, exiled or killed," Omar said. "They can't go back to the lives they lived before. Even if they give up, the regime will not -- it will go after them."
Gerges says Assad's response has deepened the commitment to the uprising rather than weakened it as Assad had hoped.
"This is a popular uprising that includes many people from different walks of life. This is a countrywide rebellion," Gerges said. "The bulk of the uprising is more of a nationalist uprising that calls for freedom and dignity."
"La Rvolution de la dignit": that is how a year later, the Tunisians remember their own uprising, in songs, on posters, on stamps. Middle East analysts say  that in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya, the more force employed by regimes, the more determined opponents became. Numbers of vocal opponents swelled and the fear of the regime ebbed as violence increased. In Tunisia, some protesters wore T-shirts with painted bull's-eyes to marches where regime snipers had fired on people.
"Week in, week out, the number of points at which a protest takes place, be they small or be they large, it's on the increase," Omar said. "A year ago, we would be lucky to have 15 protest points. Now we are averaging approximately 400 to 500 protest spots every Friday -- even the tiniest villages will actually go and protest."
The protests have been non-violent, which opponents hoped would bring international support, said Sami Ibrahim of the Syrian Network for Human Rights, speaking from Homs via Skype.
"We thought the whole world would be with us because we remained peaceful for 10 months -- without a stone in our hands," Ibrahim said.
With no help in the form of arms or military protection, an armed rebel force known as the Free Syrian Army has emerged to take on Assad's forces. The rebel army is made up largely of Syrian army soldiers who switched sides armed only with the guns they were issued.
"Syria needs freedom, but what made up my mind was being told as a soldier to kill our people," said Khalel Qadar, 30, who  fights with the force after defecting from the Syrian army six months ago. "I saw them fall before my eyes in Hama city."
Qadar and others say they will keep fighting until Assad is no more. Assad has said sanctions levied by the United States and others against his regime will not deter him from his campaign.
"Will Assad win?" said Qadar, camped out on the Syrian-Turkish border. "Only God knows, but we fight on until either he dies or we do."

Police oust Occupiers from park in NYC

BYLINE: John Bacon with staff and wire reports

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 615 words

Police gave Occupy Wall Street protesters little warning before driving them out of a New York City park overnight in an operation that included several demonstrators being beaten, one of the protesters said Sunday.
The protester, Chris Casuccio, was at Manhattan's Zuccotti Park on Saturday as demonstrators chanted and held impromptu meetings to mark the six months since the beginning of the movement against economic inequality. Detective Brian Sessa said the removal began before midnight when the protesters started breaking park rules against setting up tents. He said 73 people were detained.  Sessa said officers took out batons only after a demonstrator threw a glass bottle at the bus that police were using to detain protesters.
Wildfire forces 300 to evacuate in Colo. 
A wind-fueled wildfire on the plains of northeastern Colorado destroyed at least two homes and forced all 300 residents of a rural town to evacuate,  authorities said.
Fire spokesman Mike McCaleb said  the area burned is about 14 miles by  6 miles, and the fire is roughly 50% contained.
More than a dozen area fire departments were working to extinguish the blaze, which started south of Yuma before spreading toward Eckley, prompting evacuation orders for the town. Three firefighters suffered minor injuries.
Manhunt underway after Ind. shootings
Indianapolis police were searching for suspects a day after after five teens were shot during St. Patrick's Day revelry Saturday night.
Police Chief Paul Ciesielski said none of the injuries were life-threatening. He said that no arrests had been made but that the shootings did not appear to be random and that officers had solid leads. Ciesielski said a contributing factor was that too many teens were allowed to roam the Downtown Canal area unsupervised. "Every Saturday, we have a lot of officers down there, quite frankly, babysitting the kids.  It's not just a police problem. It's truly a community problem," he said.

Televangelist's daughter starts church
A splinter church from Crystal Cathedral, Southern California's onetime televangelism powerhouse, launched  in a rented movie theater with a breakaway pastor urging the congregation not to speak ill of its former house of worship.
Sheila Schuller Coleman, who announced she was forming the Hope Center of Christ at a worship service last Sunday, drew about 100 congregants. Coleman was senior pastor at Crystal Cathedral, which her father, Robert Schuller, founded more than 50 years ago. The megachurch has filed for bankruptcy and sold its iconic glass-encased building. Coleman's parents recently resigned from the board.
Kan. abortion bills could hit med school
The University of Kansas Medical Center says its medical school accreditation is jeopardized by two anti-abortion legislative proposals this week.
The bills are designed to ensure that if medical residents perform abortions as part of their training, they're doing it on their own time and not getting paid by the state. Physicians in training at the Medical Center in Kansas City, Kan., are considered state employees. The Chicago-based Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education has said that schools "must have an established curriculum for family planning, including complications of abortions and provisions to supply hands-on training in terminations."
Triple murder-suicide suspected in Mo.
The weekend killings of a woman and three children at a campground and resort in eastern Missouri was being investigated  as a possible triple murder-suicide, Crawford County Sheriff Randy Martin said. Each victim sustained one gunshot wound, and a handgun was found close to the bodies, he said.

Delaware's Delle Donne drops 39 in 30 minutes

BYLINE: From staff and wire reports

LENGTH: 743 words

The historic season at Delaware continued Sunday.
Elena Delle Donne, the nation's scoring leader, racked up 39 points and the third-seeded Blue Hens beat Arkansas-Little Rock 73-42 on the Trojans' home floor in the first round.
The game was Delle Donne's tournament debut and the first postseason basketball win in school history. The women had lost twice in the NCAA tournament and six times in the WNIT. The men are 0-6, including four in NCAA tournament play. 
Delle Donne rested for nearly the final nine minutes. The score when she left the game for good was 56-30.
"I think our team did a good job introducing ourselves to the country," she said.
The 6-5 junior shot 5-for-8 from three-point range and had 11 rebounds and three blocked shots.
"She's a very versatile player," the Trojans' Marian Kursh said of Delle Donne. "You feel like you are there, and then she will give you a fake and shoot above you."
Yes, Mr. President: St. John's point guard Nadirah McKenith might, for the moment, be President Obama's favorite college women's basketball player.
Last week, the president made the Red Storm, a No. 3 seed, his dark horse pick to reach the Final Four.
Sunday in Norman, Okla., McKenith made sure St. John's got past the first round. Her end-to-end rush and high-arching short shot with 0.1 seconds to go beat No. 14 Creighton 69-67.
"She's done stuff like this before. She's kind of her own highlight reel," Red Storm coach Kim Barnes Arico said. "We feel like when a game's on the line, we can put the ball in her hands and she's really been able to make plays for us."
No 14th seed has won a game in the women's tournament. The Red Storm have won their tournament opener the last three years but have never made it out of the second round.
Rock, chalk  : In Little Rock, Kansas collected its first tournament win since 1999 by taking out sixth seed Nebraska 57-49. The win comes after Kansas narrowly made the tournament after losing six of its final eight games when top scorer Carolyn Davis injured her knee.
Angel Goodrich picked up the slack Sunday with 20 points and Chelsea Gardner had 15 points and 16 rebounds.
Outfoxing the SEC: Coming into this season, Marist had not beaten a team from the Southeastern Conference in nine all-time tries.
Sunday in Tallahassee, the 13th-seeded Red Foxes made it two wins in a row this season, holding off No. 4 Georgia 76-70. One of Marist's SEC losses was to Georgia in the opening round of the 2006 tournament. Marist also beat Auburn in December.
Georgia was bounced in the first round for the second time in four seasons.
In the beginning: Also in Tallahassee, No. 5 seed St. Bonaventure made its tournament debut a success, rallying from an 11-point second-half deficit to beat No. 12 Florida Gulf Coast 72-65 in overtime. Megan Van Tatenhove led four Bonnies in double figures with 18 points. The Eagles, also making their tournament debut in their first year of eligibility, saw their 21-game winning streak end.
"This is probably our third or fourth double-figure deficit we've faced in the second half and we've come back and we've won," Bonnies coach Jim Crowley said. "They know they've done it before. This group -- they're best when their back is against the wall."
In the loss, Florida Gulf Coast set a Division I women's season record for three-pointers made with 341.
Funny seeing you here: Vanderbilt and Middle Tennessee, despite being about 40 miles apart, had not met in women's basketball since 1992.
The tournament committee matched them in a first-round game Sunday in Nashville.
The visiting Blue Raiders might not be keen for another game soon after falling 60-46.
Middle Tennessee has lost its last three tournament openers, all to SEC teams.
Warm-up acts: None of the top seeds had any particular difficulty in the opening round with Stanford's 73-51 win Saturday vs. Hampton the closest of the four matchups with No. 16 seeds. Since Harvard's 1998 upset of Stanford -- the only time a No. 16 has beaten a No. 1 in men's or women's tournament history -- the average margin of No. 1 vs. No. 16 games in women's play has not dipped below 32 points in any given year. This year's average: 32.5.
Hot hand: Courtney Moses scored 29 points Saturday, connecting on a tournament-record nine three-pointers, to pace host Purdue to an 83-68 win against South Dakota State. The sophomore came in shooting 28.1% on three-pointers this season.

Marshall's status uncertain

Midwest Regional top seed North Carolina welcomed back one key player but might have lost another Sunday during its 87-73 victory against No. 8 Creighton that sent the Tar Heels to the Sweet 16 for an NCAA-record 25th time.
Two-time Atlantic Coast Conference defensive player of the year John Henson returned after missing three games with a sprained left wrist and contributed 13 points, 10 rebounds and four blocked shots. But point guard Kendall Marshall, who had 18 points on 7-for-8 shooting plus 11 assists, broke his right wrist midway through the second half. 
Marshall was injured when he was fouled by Ethan Wragge on a drive with 10:56 remaining. Marshall jumped up after being knocked to the floor and made one of two free throws. But those were his final points.
"Let's get the bad stuff out of the way first," UNC coach Roy Williams said in his opening remarks at the postgame news  conference. "Kendall's got a fracture of the scaphoid bone of the right wrist. We'll speak to the hand specialist tonight with Kendall and his family, and we'll see what happens after that."
North Carolina  already had 7-0 ACC player of the year Tyler Zeller and 6-9 James Michael McAdoo to guard the lane against the Bluejays.  Henson, who is 6-11, gave the Tar Heels another intimidating roadblock.
"His length, his athleticism, the way he runs the floor and blocks shots -- he brings a lot to his team," said Creighton's All-America forward Doug McDermott, who had 20 points. "They were hitting shots, and we didn't have any answers."
All five UNC starters scored in double figures, and the Tar Heels were never seriously threatened in the second half, despite off nights by their top two stars. Zeller took seven shots en route to 11 points, five below his average. All-ACC forward Harrison Barnes finished with 17 points but was 4-for-15 from the field until a late surge. Barnes and McDermott were high school teammates in Iowa.
"We had to hope they missed some shots and when they missed the ball bounced our way," said Bluejays coach Greg McDermott, Doug's father. "Because their ability to rebound the basketball is a lot to overcome."
UNC averaged 81.8 points and Creighton 79.4, and the game was played at the tempo expected. The Tar Heels took the early advantage behind Marshall and never trailed after 12-11 with 13:44 left in the first half.
UNC shot 51% from the field and 50% from three-point range while outrebounding Creighton 43-34.
"It was a great win for our kids, and it was a team game, to say the least," Williams said.
"But it's sort of overshadowed by what's happened to a wonderful young man right now."
Xavier 70, Lehigh 58
The 10th  seed Musketeers shrugged off a double-digit first-half deficit to overhaul the Mountain Hawks and earn their fourth trip to the Sweet 16 in the last five seasons.
Xavier (23-12) rode the inside muscle of 7-0 center Kenny Frease and the perimeter shooting of Tu Holloway to ruin the Mountain Hawks' hope of being the first No. 15 seed to win twice. They shot 5-for-34 in the second half.
Frease finished with 25 points and 13 rebounds, while Holloway had 21 points. The Musketeers  will face third seed Baylor in Atlanta on Friday in the South Regional.
Lehigh had a 35-20 lead late in the first half despite only four points from junior guard C.J. McCollum, the No. 4 scorer in the country with a 21.9 average. He picked up two personal fouls and played 14 minutes.  Mackey McKnight torched Xavier for 14 points  as the Mountain Hawks shot 53.3% from the field in the half.
But the Musketeers closed with a 13-2 burst to pull within 37-33 at intermission. Frease had 12 points while hitting all six of his shots.
"It was a tale of two halves, certainly," Xavier coach Chris Mack said. "One of the things that really helped was the final push we made at the end of the first half."
Frease scored the first five points of the second half to ignite a 14-3 run that swung the upper hand to Xavier. Lehigh missed its first 10 shots and managed five free throws in the first seven minutes.
Lehigh pulled even at 50-50 on McCollum's jumper with 10:32 remaining, but Xavier answered with a 10-2 run. Although the Musketeers then missed the front end of two 1-and-1 foul situations, the Mountain Hawks could never pull closer than four points down the stretch.
"Basketball is just a game of runs," McKnight said. "We still had a four-point lead going into halftime. Once it came to that second half, we just went cold a little bit."

Social media's role in police investigations is growing; 
Actions raise debate on privacy rights, outdated laws

BYLINE: Roger Yu, USA TODAY

SECTION: MONEY; Pg. 11B

LENGTH: 945 words

Police investigators in Cincinnati stumbled upon an online video last year showing an act of armed robbery, helpfully taped by the perpetrators themselves.
The analysts at the city's Real Time Crime Center found the footage on a Facebook page while using the popular social-media site to investigate another crime. The suspects were eventually arrested.
"We were looking at friends and friends of friends of the suspects (in the other case), and we just happened to run across it," says Lt. Lisa Thomas, who heads the center that was founded two years ago to monitor the Internet and the cameras installed across the city. "You have guys who are bragging about their crimes online." 
With more netizens flaunting their actions and thoughts in the open, social media has become a mainstay in police work. Police departments and federal agencies are aggressively seeking information from social-media companies, beefing up their budgets and providing training to dig for online clues left by criminals and victims in targeted investigations.
They can and do routinely order social-media companies to shut down a Twitter or Facebook page, for example, immediately after a crime has been committed or have relevant information archived before any changes can be made. "It's no different than physical evidence," says Bob Hopper, manager of the Computer Crimes section at the National White Collar Crime Center.
But the issue of properly handling social-media content is also igniting heated debates about privacy and the limits of the current law that spells out how police can legally retrieve personal data. Adding to the confusion is the reality that rules and logistics for obtaining private information are still not firmly established for many police departments. Fewer than half of all law enforcement agencies, 48.6%, have a social-media policy, according to a survey by the International Association of Chiefs of Police.
"You'd hope that even big police departments would have people on staff to know the law," says Mark Rumold, an attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. "But the law is arcane and confusing. And there is a significant debate on what governs what. There's a learning curve they have to go through."
About 88% of law enforcement agencies have used social-media sites -- Facebook is the most frequently used, while Twitter is gaining -- in monitoring and investigative work, the IACP survey says.
But at a time when police departments are cutting their budgets nationwide, coping with the new technological challenge is also proving to be a budgetary headache.
Thomas of the Cincinnati police department says her office's staffing has grown to seven analysts in two years, but she would like to add more.
Her unit averaged 23 social-media investigation requests a month from various districts two years ago. They now receive more than 100 requests a month.  "Word is getting out that we're beneficial for (obtaining) information, but also that you can prove things. That it helps to solidify their case," she says.
Getting access
Social-media companies use standard legalese to spell out their policies for granting access to individuals' online accounts.
Facebook says it provides information for emergencies and to prevent fraud and other illegal activities, as well as for "violations of the Facebook Terms," a legal catch-all provision that gives the company a wide range of options in controlling users' pages.
The Facebook page of  Thomas "T.J." Lane, the suspect in the recent shooting deaths at Chardon (Ohio) High School, was shut down because of a post he wrote, possibly foreshadowing his intentions. Facebook declined to comment on specific cases.
After a crime has been committed, "Facebook pages go down pretty quickly," says Rabbi Abraham Cooper, who specializes in monitoring digital hate crimes and terrorism for the Simon Wiesenthal Center. "What right does law enforcement have to shut down the pages? Clearly, the cops will say it is evidence and that they are entitled to it. Cops are routinely doing this without a court order."
Facebook says that its requirement for law enforcement to obtain content is disclosed publicly on its website. For basic subscriber records, such as name and account holder verification, police must provide a subpoena. A warrant  showing probable cause is required for stored content, including messages and photos.
"Law enforcement often uses 'emergency situation' to circumvent the warrant requirement," says Ginger McCall, an attorney at the Electronic Privacy Information Center.
Some social-media companies are more reluctant than others to release data, McCall says.
When federal regulators sought private Twitter account information, Twitter fought to notify the users. In November, a judge ruled that federal investigators can collect the private Twitter records and blocked the users' attempt to discover if other Internet companies were ordered to reveal their data.
Privacy advocates also say the 26-year-old federal law that primarily sets the boundaries for law enforcement to obtain  electronic communications  is too outdated in its application to social media. When the Electronic Communications Privacy Act  was passed in 1986, e-mail was stored in a personal computer. And the law required police to obtain a warrant to access some types of messages.
With social-media information now stored in the cloud, on remote third-party servers, content owners have traded in control for convenience. "No one is clear on the legal standard for cloud-stored information," says Chris Calabrese, an attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union.
"The act was last updated when Top Gun was in the theater."

Florida squelches Norfolk State; 
Fast-starting Gators cruise

BYLINE: Steve Wieberg, USA TODAY

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 4C

LENGTH: 618 words

One bracket-rattling upset. The toast of the NCAA tournament for a couple of days.
That's as far as Florida would let it get for Norfolk State.
The seventh-seeded Gators took control from the start Sunday, burying Norfolk with a run of 25 consecutive points and coasting to an 84-50 victory. They reached the NCAA's Sweet 16 for the third consecutive year and will meet No. 3-seeded Marquette in Phoenix on Thursday.
Norfolk will settle for a single shining moment. 
The Spartans (26-10) delivered the centerpiece of an early round of upsets in the tourney, stunning Missouri and becoming the fifth 15th-seeded team to take out a No.2. Lehigh joined them hours later.
Following up has proved impossible. Not counting Lehigh, whose game against Xavier ended too late for this edition, one of the previous 15th-seeded insurgents came within 11 points of its second-round opponent. Each lost.
Norfolk's bid against Florida went awry from its first shot from the field 20 seconds into the game: an off-target three-point attempt by 6-10, 240-pound center Kyle O'Quinn.
The Spartans missed all but two of their first 17 field goal attempts. O'Quinn had two early blocks on defense but was blocked, in turn, by the Gators' Casey Prather, who was giving up 4 inches.
"They came out, executed well," Spartans coach Anthony Evans said. "They prevented us from doing the things that we wanted to do."
Triggered at the other end by guard Erving Walker and Kenny Boynton, the Gators connected on five treys in a little less than five minutes amid the 25-0 breakaway that gave them full control, 29-6, in the game's first 10 minutes.
Two nights earlier, Norfolk hadn't let Missouri move ahead by more than four.
By halftime Sunday, Florida was ahead by 28 points.
Boynton finished with 20 points, Walker 15, the two combining for 21 in the opening half.
Six different Florida players hit three-pointers.
"When pretty much your season's on the line, your college career is on the line, it gets frustrating," O'Quinn said. "They played good defense. We played bad offense. Every time we had a break, they killed us with a three."
The Gators (25-10) continued their recovery from a late-season stumble.
They were ranked as high as No. 7 in November, then again in early February, but lost their last three games of the regular season.
Their shooting slumped.
They missed 6-7 sophomore Will Yeguete, one of their top rebounders, who was lost to a broken left foot Feb. 21.
But they played well in a 74-71 loss to top-ranked Kentucky in the Southeastern Conference tournament semifinals, then hammered Virginia 71-45 in their NCAA opener Friday. The nation's most prolific three-point shooting team survived an atrocious, 4-for-23 performance behind the line in that game.
The Gators reversed that against Norfolk State, nailing seven treys in the first half. They finished with 10.
It was a sadder reversal for the Spartans, making their first NCAA appearance after winning the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference tournament.
"They're the best three-point shooting team in the country, and they showed it," O'Quinn said. "It was just tough all around for us."
O'Quinn, whose effervescent personality and 24-point, 16-rebound performance vs. Missouri made him an instant star -- he warbled the tournament anthem, One Shining Moment, during an appearance Saturday on CBS -- made one of his nine shots and finished with four points and three rebounds.
Point guard Pendarvis Williams was 2-for-7 from the field and finished with five points.
"We've done things that no one has done before at our our university," Evans said. "I'm proud of them. I appreciate their effort.
"It wasn't the type of game that we would like to have played, but Florida did a great job."

Midwest Regional top seed North Carolina welcomed back one key player but might have lost another Sunday during its 87-73 victory against No. 8 Creighton that sent the Tar Heels to the Sweet 16 for an NCAA-record 25th time.
Two-time Atlantic Coast Conference Defensive Player of the Year John Henson returned after missing three games with a sprained left wrist and contributed 13 points, 10 rebounds and four blocked shots.

Marshall was injured when he was fouled by Ethan Wragge on a drive to the basket with 10:56 remaining. Marshall jumped up after being knocked to the floor and made one of two free throws. But those were his final points of the game. He missed the front end of a 1-and-1 with 7:09 remaining and did not shoot again, although he had two assists before coming out of the game to stay with 1:54 to play.
"Let's get the bad stuff out of the way first," UNC coach Roy Williams in his opening remarks at the post-game news  conference. "Kendall's got a fracture of the scaphoid bone of the right wrist.

But North Carolina scored the first four points of the second half, and a 9-0 run sparked by Henson and Marshall pushed the lead to 61-42 with 14 minutes left. The closest Creighton came after that was 12 points with 5:15 remaining, and Barnes answered by hitting back-to-back three-pointers.
UNC shot 51% from the field and 50% from three-point range while outrebounding Creighton 43-34.
"It was a great win for our kids and it was a team game, to say the least," Williams said. "But it's sort of overshadowed by what's happened to a wonderful young man right now."

Afghanistan shooting suspect snapped, showing strains of war

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 8A

LENGTH: 418 words

The soldier accused of killing  all those innocent people, mostly children, in Afghanistan, does not deserve the death penalty; he needs help ("Suspect's background a mix of patriotism and stress," USATODAY.com, Saturday). 
After three deployments in Iraq and a traumatic brain injury, Staff Sgt. Robert Bales was  deemed OK to resume combat in Afghanistan. Is it any wonder he snapped? The fact that  children were among the victims tells the story. Perhaps, with his  wife and children at home, and after being yanked back and forth so much, he thought, "If I can't be with my children, then neither can  these people." Also, the fact that soldiers are committing suicide at an alarming rate should tell us something.
Wake up, people. War and killing are not a natural state for a human being.
Richard Kerrigan
Girard, Ohio
We hold U.S. to higher standards
USA TODAY reader Harry Noll wrote a  callous letter in an attempt to diminish the uproar over the killing of 16 civilians, many children.  To me, it is unacceptable to simply say "death is part of the atrocities of war" ("Don't overlook progress achieved," Thursday).
Of course we are not as outraged over each Taliban or suicide bomber who  has killed civilians as we are about one of our own doing this. We are supposed to be the good guys, remember? Of course our shock is much greater because we are, we hope, holding ourselves to higher standards.
Some Americans may condone government-organized torture, but I don't think we are that far lost yet that we can respond to killing of children by one of our soldiers with an ice-cold  response such as "death is part of the atrocities of war."

Time to leave Afghanistan
I really enjoyed Al Neuharth's  column "Afghan war is hell; let's get the hell out." It is so true (Plain Talk, The Forum, Friday).
I have been saying the same thing since the Navy  SEALs took care of Osama bin Laden. I don't always agree with  Neuharth, but I sure did this time. Thanks for the commentary. I hope it wakes enough people up so that we get out of Afghanistan very soon.
Dave Grinstead
Bellingham, Wash.
Give Bush credit for withdrawal
Al Neuharth, like many other commentators,  continues to give President Obama credit for bringing our troops home from Iraq last year.
In  2008,  before leaving office, President  Bush and the prime minister of Iraq signed an agreement declaring that most U.S.  troops would leave Iraq by December  2011.
Obama honored that agreement, period.

Feds to probe killing of unarmed Florida teen

BYLINE: John Bacon with staff and wire reports

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 607 words

The Justice Department announced late Monday that will investigate the fatal shooting death of an unarmed black teen in Florida by a neighborhood watch captain, a case that has garnered national attention.
The agency said in a statement that it will perform an independent review of the evidence and take appropriate action.
George Zimmerman, 28, claims he shot Trayvon Martin, 17, last month in self-defense during a confrontation in a gated community in Sanford, Fla. Zimmerman spotted Martin as he was patrolling his neighborhood on a rainy evening  and called 911 to report a suspicious person. Against the dispatcher's advice,  Zimmerman followed Martin, who was walking home from a convenience store with a bag of Skittles in his pocket. 
Earlier Monday, college students around Florida rallied to demand Zimmerman's arrest. Civil rights activist Al Sharpton is  to join a  town-hall-style forum about the case in Sanford today.
S.F. sheriff gets 3 years' probation
A contrite and emotional San Francisco sheriff apologized Monday for a domestic violence incident with his wife after a judge sentenced him to three years of probation and ordered him to attend an anti-domestic violence program.
Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi was sentenced for bruising the bicep of his wife, Eliana Lopez. "There are no excuses, and I accept full responsibility,"  Mirkarimi said outside court. He choked up several times when he mentioned his longing to reunite with his wife and 3-year-old son.
San Francisco District Attorney George Gascon  Mirkarimi will be barred from carrying a gun until a judge lifts a stay-away order that prevents the sheriff from seeing his wife without court permission.
Louisiana loses battle for House seat
The Supreme Court rejected Louisiana's bid to recover the congressional seat taken from the state as a result of the 2010 Census.
The  ruling prevents the state from pursuing a lawsuit that claims the Census unfairly included undocumented immigrants in each state's population count. Louisiana said California, Florida, Texas and other states with large populations of undocumented immigrants gained seats in the U.S. House of Representatives at the expense of Louisiana and other states. Louisiana went from seven to six seats in the House.
N.Y. zookeeper bitten by escaped gorilla
A 380-pound gorilla at the Buffalo Zoo escaped its enclosure and bit a zookeeper who locked herself in with other gorillas and called for help.
Buffalo Zoo CEO Donna Fernandes said an animal escape team backed up by police SWAT members trapped Koga, a 24-year-old male silverback, in a  lounge before tranquilizing him and returning him to his enclosure.
The zookeeper -- who had locked herself in a holding cage with Sidney, a 14-year-old gorilla, and her 1-year-old baby, Amari -- suffered superficial  wounds on her right hand and left calf, Fernandes said.-- WGRZ-TV, Buffalo
Split decision on smoking warnings
A federal law that requires cigarette packages to carry graphic warnings about smoking and restricts tobacco marketing and advertising is constitutional, a federal appeals court ruled.
The Kentucky case is one of two by tobacco companies against federal rules that would make them display the large  images on  packs depicting the ravages of smoking. The other case resulted in a federal judge in Washington blocking the  requirement, arguing last month it violated free speech. That decision is being appealed by the government. A three-judge panel from the 6th Circuit in Cincinnati ruled in the Kentucky case that the government can protect consumers. Floyd Abrams, lawyer for Lorillard Tobacco, said he expects the Supreme Court to decide.

Massacre suspect said to have memory gap; 
As stockbroker, Bales was linked to fraud

BYLINE: Elizabeth Weise

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 610 words

Staff Sgt. Robert Bales,  awaiting charges at Fort Leavenworth in the killings of 16 civilians in Afghanistan, has a sketchy memory of the night of the massacre, his lawyer said Monday.
Seattle lawyer John Henry Browne said Bales remembers some details from before and after the killings, but very little or nothing from the time the military says he went on the shooting spree.
"He has some memory of some things that happened that night. He has some memories of before the incident, and he has some memories of after the incident. In between, very little," Browne told the Associated Press. 
Pressed whether Bales remembers anything about the shooting, Browne said, "No," but added, "I haven't gotten that far with him yet."
More details emerged Monday of Bales' background and financial pressures.  Bales, along with his former brokerage firm, was ordered to pay $1.5million after an arbitration panel found in 2003 they "engaged in fraud" in handling a client's account, records show.
The National Association of Securities Dealers  ruled for the client, Gary Liebschner,  and ordered Bales, his company and another man to pay  compensatory and punitive damages. It said that besides fraud, they engaged in "breach of fiduciary duty, churning, unauthorized trading and unsuitable investments.''
The ruling involved a claim filed by Liebschner in 2000, for actions when Bales was working as a broker in Ohio. The ruling came in 2003, after Bales had joined the Army. The panel said Bales did not respond to the charges.
Ohio  station WCPO-TV quoted Liebschner's wife as saying they asked Bales to sell stock to pay medical bills but never received the proceeds. Liebschner and his attorney, Earle Frost,  of Columbus, Ohio, did not return  calls late Monday.
Browne met his client behind bars for the first time Monday and described the conversation  as "really emotional" as Bales, 38 and a father of two, talked of his three months in the war zone.
"What's going on on the ground in Afghanistan, you read about it, I read about it, but it's totally different when you hear about it from somebody who's been there," Browne said.
Bales, who enlisted in the Army  after the 9/11,  terrorist attacks allegedly left his combat outpost  March 11 and walked to two nearby villages and then shot, stabbed and burned 16 sleeping Afghans, including nine children.
In a statement  Monday, Bales' wife, Karilyn, called the shootings  a " heartbreaking tragedy."
"The victims and their families are all in my prayers, as is my husband who I love very much," she said. "What has been reported is completely out of character of the man I know and admire."
The military relocated the family last week from their home in Bonney Lake, Wash., to Joint Base Lewis-McChord, where Bales is based. Movers retrieved the family's furniture Monday.
Army records show no blemishes on Bales' service, but his wife's blog  indicates  his family was distressed by his fourth deployment and disappointed  that he was passed over for a promotion.
A few days before the incident,  his wife put their four-bedroom  house up for sale for $229,000 -- $51,000 less than they  paid for it in 2005.
Many military families around Joint Base Lewis-McChord, where Bales was stationed, encounter financial difficulty when military assignments require moves in a soft market, said real estate agent agent Anna LaMotte of Prudential Northwest Realty Associates, who has worked with troops soldiers for 20 years.
"People in this country don't understand how many sacrifices they make, even financial ones," she said.

Afghan shooting tragic, but be wary of being too lenient

BYLINE: DeWayne Wickham

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 9A

LENGTH: 602 words

Even before the identity of the Army staff sergeant believed to have massacred 16 people in an Afghanistan village became known, excuses for his ghoulish acts of terror started popping up in the news media, diminishing the likelihood that justice will prevail in this case.
In one account, an unnamed military official said the suspect -- who has since been identified as 38-year-old Robert Bales -- had been drinking alcohol the night of the murderous rampage. Another official said he was distraught over an incident in which a fellow soldier's leg was blown off. 
There were reports that Bales might have had marital and financial problems, and a story that he suffered a head wound  during the last of his three deployments to Iraq. In some "chronic cases," that sort of injury "can lead to cognitive problems, personality changes and a loss of impulse control," The New York Times reported  after Bales was named as the lone suspect.
The details so far
What we know for certain is that nine children, three women and four  men were killed. These innocent victims were attacked as they slept in villages that were supposed to be protected by soldiers on Bales' nearby base. The bodies of some of the victims were set on fire. That's the work of a murderous madman. But don't expect Bales to be treated like one  if he's convicted of the late-night killing spree. History suggests otherwise.
Not one of the eight Marines charged in the 2005 massacre of 24 people in Iraq, including women, children and a man in a wheelchair, was imprisoned. One was acquitted, the charges against six others were dropped. The sergeant who admitted ordering his men to "shoot first and ask questions later" was given a plea bargain, serving no  time behind bars.
And though William Calley, the Army lieutenant who ordered the 1968 attack that killed 500 unarmed people in the Vietnamese village of My Lai, was found guilty of personally killing 22 people, he served just three-and-a-half years of house arrest before President  Nixon commuted his sentence.
A sympathetic public
In each case, public opinion among war-weary Americans opposed harsh punishment for these mass murderers, who were seen more as victims of unpopular wars -- men who were driven over the brink by the bad decision-making of their superiors or of Washington policymakers.
Such shortsightedness damages more than the American concept of justice. It also does great injury to the democratic ideals we use to justify the continued presence of U.S. troops in Afghanistan and Iraq. And  when an American soldier who commits a crime gets off with little or no punishment, it devalues the lives of their foreign victims and creates tensions that put at risk the lives of other U.S. servicemembers who get targeted for retribution.
Of course, war can take a heavy emotional and psychological toll on those who are sent into battle. But that's no excuse for the brutal slaughter Bales is suspected of committing. Unfortunately, many news media organizations appear to suggest otherwise by putting more effort into looking for explanations for Bales' alleged bad acts than in trying to uncover the details of those heartless crimes.
To imply that a U.S. soldier who goes on a killing spree in a foreign land is less culpable because of the pressures of war slanders the incredibly good conduct of the millions of U.S. men and women who have served honorably in Iraq and Afghanistan.
The person who massacred the Afghan villagers deserves the contempt of this nation -- and the unyielding judgment of its criminal justice system.

Motorcycle gunman kills four at French Jewish school

BYLINE: The Associated Press

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 6A

LENGTH: 399 words

A motorbike assailant opened fire with two handguns Monday in front of a Jewish school in the French city of Toulouse, killing a rabbi, his two young sons and a girl. One witness described him as a man chasing small children and "looking to kill." 
One of the guns the attacker used had been fired in two other deadly motorbike attacks in the area that targeted paratroopers of North African and French Caribbean origin, officials said.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy suggested one person was responsible for all the killings. "This act was odious, it cannot remain unpunished," he said.
A massive manhunt was underway, and the terrorism alert level was raised to its highest level ever across a swath of southern France surrounding Toulouse. Hundreds of officers increased security at schools, synagogues and mosques across the country, and Sarkozy said 14 riot police units "will secure the region" until the suspect has been caught.
France has seen a number  of anti-Semitic incidents in recent years, but no attack targeting Jews since the early 1980s has been so deadly. This country is particularly sensitive toward its Jewish community because of its World War II past of abetting Nazi occupiers in deporting Jewish citizens.
French prosecutors were studying possible terrorist links, but the motive for all three attacks was unclear. In all three cases, the attacker came on a motorcycle, apparently alone, and then sped away.
In Monday's attack, Rabbi Jonathan Sandler, 30, and two of his sons were killed just before classes started at the Ozar Hatorah school, a junior high and high school, Toulouse Prosecutor Michel Valet said. The Israeli Foreign Ministry said the sons were 4 and 5 years old.
Another child, the 7-year-old daughter of the school principal, was also killed, school officials said. Valet said a 17-year-old boy was seriously wounded.
The gunman "shot at everything he had in front of him, children and adults," Valet said. "The children were chased inside the school."
Nicole Yardeni, a local Jewish official who saw security video of the attack, described the shooter as "determined, athletic and well-toned." He wore a helmet with the visor down, Yardeni said.
"You see a man park his motorcycle, start to shoot, enter the school grounds and chase children to catch one and shoot a bullet into her head," Yardeni said. "It's unbearable to watch.  He was looking to kill."

Trayvon Martin is dead; nation is soul-searching; 
Racism? Self-defense? Calls for justice in Fla. shooting

BYLINE: Yamiche Alcindor, Marisol Bello and Larry Copeland, USA TODAY

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 1A

LENGTH: 1682 words

Spurred by social media and community rallies, the shooting death of a 17-year-old Florida youth has become the latest flashpoint over how young black men are perceived in the United States.
Trayvon Martin's death Feb. 26 at the hands of a Neighborhood Watch leader in this small, gated Florida community has rippled through many corners of the nation's justice and political system and raised questions about the relationship between the black community and police in small towns.
In the past 48 hours, the case has:
Sparked an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice, the FBI and the Florida state attorney's office; 
Brought calls for changes in a Florida self-defense law that says a person being attacked has no duty to retreat and may return force;
Ignited protests, including a "Million Hoodie March" in New York City planned today, and a rally Thursday in Sanford led by civil rights activist  Al Sharpton;
Amassed more than 600,000 signatures in an online petition calling for charges to be filed  against George Zimmerman, the Neighborhood Watch captain who said he shot Martin.
Zimmerman has not been arrested or charged with a crime.
The case has resonated for many who say Martin died because of stereotypes of young black men as violent criminals. The shooting is already being compared with high-profile and historic civil rights cases -- for instance, a doctored photograph has circulated throughout many social media sites that compares Martin to Emmett Till, a young man lynched by white men in 1950s Mississippi.
"It's not about these individual acts of racism," said Mark Neal, a professor of African and African American Studies at Duke University. "It's about the way that black males are framed in the larger culture  as being violent, criminal and threats to safety and property."
The tragic case played out in Sanford, population 54,000, about 30 minutes north of Orlando, when Martin left his father's home to buy candy and iced tea for his little brother at a nearby 7-Eleven.
He was on his way back in the rain when Zimmerman, 28, spotted him. Zimmerman was armed as he patroled the area in his car in response to several break-ins in the community.
Zimmerman called 911 to report a suspicious person, according to the call released by Sanford emergency dispatch. Against the advice of the 911 dispatcher, Zimmerman followed Martin, according to the 911 recording.
The two men fought and Trayvon Martin was left dead. Zimmerman told the Sanford police that he shot the teen in self-defense because he was fearful for his life. The  police have said there is no evidence to contradict Zimmerman's claims. Police say Zimmerman was bleeding from his nose and the back of his head.
Zimmerman has not spoken publicly. In a statement, his father, Robert, said, "The portrayal of George Zimmerman in the media, as well as the series of events that led to the tragic shooting are false and extremely misleading.  George is a Spanish-speaking minority with many black family members and friends. He would be the last to discriminate for any reason whatsoever."
Outrage in Sanford
The fatal shooting touched a chord of community outrage in Sanford on Tuesday  night. The killing was "a senseless murder as far as we are concerned," Seminole County NAACP President Turner Clayton told a capacity crowd at the start of a town-hall-style meeting at Allen Chapel AME Church.
Clayton said the Sanford city manager and mayor were unable to attend because they had been "summoned" to Washington by Attorney General Eric Holder.
"The line has been drawn in the sand," Clayton said. "We as people of color are going to stand our ground. We are going to do it in a non-violent way, and we are going to prevail."
Before his son's death, Tracy Martin warned  son Trayvon that being a black man in America could be dangerous. "I've always let him know we as African Americans get stereotyped," he told USA TODAY. "I told him that society is cruel."
Those warning messages have echoed in Tracy Martin's head since his son died.
Martin family attorney Benjamin Crump said Tuesday that the young man was on the phone with his girlfriend when Zimmerman followed and approached him. He said the 16-year-old girl told a harrowing story that he says shows Martin did not attack Zimmerman.
The girl, whose family asked the attorney not to reveal her identity, told Crump that she and Martin were talking on the phone when he left the store, a bag of Skittles in his pocket. Crump said as Martin walked home, he told the girl, "This dude is following me."
Crump said the girl told him that she told Martin to run. Martin ran, which coincided with Zimmerman's comments to 911 in which he said the suspicious man was running, Crump said.
"Then she hears (Martin) say, 'Why are you following me?' and another voice say, 'What are you doing in the neighborhood?'" Crump said.
Police actions questioned
The girl told Crump she then thought she could hear Trayvon was pushed and she heard a brief altercation, then the line went dead.
"This claim that Trayvon Martin was the aggressor is preposterous," the attorney  said.
Crump has questioned Sanford police actions after the shooting, noting that  police did not run a blood-alcohol test or a background check on Zimmerman, but they ran  both on Martin after he died. He said police took Zimmerman's word without conducting a thorough investigation.
Tracy Martin says he wants Zimmerman arrested and tried in court.
"My child was profiled," the father said. "He was stereotyped. We aren't letting our son die in vain."
The decision not to arrest Zimmerman was made by the responding officer who released the gunman after he claimed to have acted in self-defense, Sanford officials said Tuesday.
It was only after a growing public outcry expressing a lack of confidence in the police department's actions that city leaders called on the Justice Department to review the  shooting, City Manager Norton Bonaparte  and Mayor Jeff Triplett said.
"We have a lot of strife in our community right now," Triplett said at a Capitol Hill briefing where he and Bonaparte appeared with Rep. Corrine Brown, a Florida Democrat. "If we've made an error, I want someone to tell me. There will be no stone that won't be overturned."
Triplett said the Justice investigation would review all aspects of the case, including the police response and the decision not to arrest Zimmerman.
Bonaparte acknowledged  Zimmerman was part of a network of local Neighborhood Watch groups trained by the Sanford Police Department and urged "not to engage"  possible suspects or people they encounter. Brown said she was "not satisfied" with the initial handling of the case, agreeing  that Zimmerman was not tested for possible substance abuse immediately after the incident and lamenting that proper steps were not taken to preserve possible evidence at the scene.
"People need to feel that the system is fair," Brown said. "It just wasn't handled right."
In conversations with the Sanford police chief, Triplett said he believes the Florida law known as the "stand your ground" statute, which provides a broader interpretation of self-defense, played a role in the decision not to arrest and charge Zimmerman.
The law allows the use of force if the person "reasonably believes" it is necessary to protect the person's own life, or the life of another or to prevent a forcible felony.
In the wake of Martin's death, the law is getting a second look.  State Sen. Oscar Braynon, who represents Miami Gardens where the teen lived with his mother, called for hearings or a select committee to clarify what constitutes self-defense under the law. He said that since the law was enacted in 2005, the number of justified homicides in the state has skyrocketed. In 2005, there were 43 such cases;  in 2009, the last complete year available, there were 105, Braynon said.
"I think there is vigilante justice happening and I think people are getting shot," he said. "This is an unintended consequence of the law."
Social media's role
Public activism has played a pivotal role in bringing national attention to the case and ultimately leading to a top-to-bottom review of what happened that day. A wellspring of social media grew by the day and became relentless, demanding that the spotlight return to Sanford. It's the only way to galvanize people in such cases, says Neal, the Duke professor.
"If folks aren't on Twitter tweeting stories and giving particular testimonies; if you don't have artists doing videos on YouTube talking about what Trayvon might have experienced  I don't think we get a moment where suddenly the Justice Department is saying we need to investigate this case," Neal says.
Change.org spokeswoman Brianna Cayo Cotter said the petition calling for prosecution of Zimmerman was drawing the second-highest amount of traffic to the site since a petition was launched for Kyleigh's Law, a measure passed in New Jersey in 2010 that requires drivers younger than 18 with permits or probationary licenses to display special decals on their vehicles. Kyleigh D'Alessio was 16 when she died in a 2006 car crash.
"We are seeing unprecedented traffic on our website," Cayo Cotter said.
The attention is also focusing on the town of Sanford, which has a history of racial tensions.
"This case more than anything reminds me of Jena -- of a small Southern town that played by its own rules," Sharpton said. "Sanford authorities thought they could contain it.  Once it becomes national, they can't contain and control the story and the outcome."
The Jena 6 were  black teens initially charged in 2006 with attempted murder for beating a white schoolmate in Jena, La. After a national outcry, community rallies and online petitions, the charges were reduced.
Theo Shaw, 23, one of the Jena 6 who is preparing to attend law school in the fall, says, "This is another incident in which there is a presumption that a young black man has been guilty of something."

Sandusky lawyer to get more information

LENGTH: 632 words

Prosecutors on Tuesday were ordered to give Jerry Sandusky's lawyer the phone numbers and addresses of those who have accused the ex-Penn State assistant football coach of child sex abuse.
The order by Judge John Cleland could also lead to the prosecution turning over psychological evaluations performed on the accusers, but prosecutors were given a week to argue against it.
Ben Andreozzi, the lawyer for one accuser, contended defense lawyer Joe Amendola was putting the victims on trial and creating distractions. "Mr. Sandusky knows what he did to these young men," Andreozzi said. 
Sandusky, suspected of abusing 10 boys over 15 years, faces a May trial.
Evidence questioned in Afghan killings
The lawyer for the Army staff sergeant suspected of killing 16 Afghan civilians questioned the quality of the evidence against his client and said he will travel to Afghanistan to gather his own.
John Henry Browne said he met with Robert Bales for 11 hours over two days at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas, where his client is being held.
He said that there was still a lot he didn't know about the March 11 shootings. "There's no forensic evidence. There's no confessions," Browne said. Bales, 38, has not been charged yet.
S.F. mayor seeks removal of sheriff
San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee said he will suspend the sheriff and seek to permanently remove him from office over his domestic violence conviction involving his wife.
Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi turned down Lee's suggestion to resign after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor false imprisonment charge. He was sentenced Monday to three years of probation and a year of counseling. Lee said he will file official misconduct charges today.  Mirkarimi earlier said he would fight to keep his job because he believes he didn't commit "official misconduct."
Clinton backs search for Earhart's plane
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton gave her support to  the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery's search for the wreckage of Amelia Earhart's Lockheed Electra plane in the waters off the  Pacific island of Nikumaroro.
Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan disappeared July 2, 1937, while flying from New Guinea to Howland Island during her attempt to become the first female pilot to circumnavigate the globe. A new analysis of an October 1937 photo of the shoreline shows what could be a strut and wheel. Clinton, at a State Department event to announce the search, called Earhart an inspiration to Americans, then and now.
Marine hero could get Medal of Honor
The Navy reopened the valor case of Marine Sgt. Rafael Peralta based on new evidence that reportedly removes any doubt about his heroism before his death in Iraq in 2004.
Two previously unseen videos and a recent study by a renowned forensic pathologist will be used to help determine whether Peralta should receive the Medal of Honor. Witnesses in Fallujah say Peralta, wounded by a gunshot  to the head, pulled a live grenade under his body and absorbed the blast, saving the lives of fellow Marines. Navy Secretary Ray Mabus said a decision will be made in "a matter of weeks."

Country stars to aid tornado-torn town
An Indiana high school wrecked by March tornadoes won a concert by country music trio Lady Antebellum after an online campaign that drew support from students in other states.
Schools from as far away as northern Wisconsin submitted YouTube videos urging the trio to choose Henryville, Ind., as the winner of its prom contest. The group has a prom night conflict, so it will perform May 16 in nearby Louisville for the school's juniors and seniors before a benefit for the community. Singer Charles Kelley said students shouldn't be disappointed that the band can't visit their community: "Trust me, we have something even bigger in store."

Size in demand for playoffs

BYLINE: J. Michael Falgoust

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 7C

LENGTH: 556 words

NBA players released from their teams have 48 hours to clear waivers before becoming free agents. A player can sign with any team except the team that waived him or, if applicable, the team that dealt him to the team that waived him.
For example, the Los Angeles Lakers dealt guard Derek Fisher at the trade deadline to the Houston Rockets, who waived him. Fisher cannot play for either team this season. 
Why is this important? Friday at 11:59 p.m. ET is the NBA waiver deadline. Any player waived by then is playoff-eligible if picked up by another team and signed by April 27, the day before postseason play begins.
Where some players could be going if they clear waivers:
Ronny Turiaf: Big men are in demand even though this 6-10 center played in only four games for the Washington Wizards and has been limited by an injured left (non-shooting) hand. He won't put up big numbers, but playoff-bound teams such as the Boston Celtics and Miami Heat could use his size. His agent, Mark Bartelstein, said Turiaf was considering a handful of playoff teams.
Ryan Hollins: Waived by the Cleveland Cavaliers, the 7-0 center has drawn interest from two playoff teams and a non-playoff team, said a person familiar with the situation who requested anonymity until a public announcement. If the Celtics don't get Turiaf, look for them to make a run at Hollins.
Fisher: The Heat, who courted him during the offseason when he was a free agent, had gotten solid play from rookie guard Norris Cole until recently. The Oklahoma City Thunder could use another point guard behind starter Russell Westbrook. Fisher was interested in the Chicago Bulls, but the feeling wasn't mutual.
J.J. Hickson: The 6-9 power forward was bought out of his contract by the Sacramento Kings after a dreadful first season there. He's what many teams refer to as a "glue guy," meaning he does a lot of the dirty work on the boards and makes hustle plays that can make a difference. His name has come up in discussions by the Golden State Warriors and Phoenix Suns.
Terrence Williams: He was set to join the Kings because of their open-court offense under coach Keith Smart, said a person familiar with the situation who requested anonymity until a public announcement. It would be an audition for Williams, looking to be a more attractive free agent this offseason.
Patty Mills: The 6-0 Australian-born guard was in China during the lockout and hasn't played in the NBA this season. Mills is expected to sign a two-year deal with the San Antonio Spurs, pending visa issues, said a person familiar with the situation who requested anonymity until a public announcement.
Andres Nocioni: Waived Tuesday by the Philadelphia 76ers, the 6-7 forward is looking at four or five teams, said his agent, George Bass.
Also: Gilbert Arenas has signed with the Memphis Grizzlies; the 6-3 guard hasn't played yet this season.  Coach Doc Rivers said Boston would look to add one or two big men to replace center Jermaine O'Neal, who will have season-ending wrist surgery.  Denver Nuggets forward Danilo Gallinari broke the thumb on his left (non-shooting) hand and guard Andre Miller separated his right shoulder Monday in a loss to the Dallas Mavericks. Gallinari, who missed a month with a chip fracture in his left ankle, could be out for four weeks.

McLaren supercar aims for fast lane; 
Designed to be at home racing or commuting

BYLINE: Chris Woodyard, USA TODAY

SECTION: MONEY; Pg. 3B

LENGTH: 875 words

While its name may be an unappealing mouthful, this coupe certainly deserves the title "supercar."
The new McLaren MP4-12C stays flat, even in the tightest turns, and accelerates in breathtaking bursts on the Auto Club Speedway in this town east of Los Angeles.
The 12C has won attention for a custom-designed, 592-horsepower V-8 and carbon-fiber construction that gives it a dry weight of 2,868 pounds and bragging rights over rival supercars such as Ferrari's 458 Italia coupe, with a dry weight of 3,042. 
The twin-seat coupe, which starts at $231,400 with shipping, would look far more at home on a Grand Prix course than on a workday commuter route. Yet it was designed to be at home in both places.
The MP4-12C is both the "ultimate sports car" and "a car you can drive every day," says Anthony Joseph, McLaren Automotive's regional director for North America. "It's a car with a dual personality."
The road car is McLaren Automotive's first branded  model as an independent, privately owned company since Mercedes-Benz let go of its 40% stake two years ago. If McLaren is to meet its goal now of a new model every year, the MP4-12C must succeed.
Since deliveries began late last year, about 1,000 cars have rolled out of McLaren's factory in Woking, England. The company is shooting for production of about 4,000 cars a year by mid-decade. But it is competing with a growing list of rivals for well-heeled supercar buyers. Others besides the Ferrari 458 are the Audi R8 GT, Lamborghini Aventador LP 700-4, Lexus LFA and Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG.
To stand out in that rarefied field, McLaren officials say they were meticulous in every detail -- and arguably obsessive when it came to cutting weight.
Example:  The magnesium dashboard, 75% lighter than steel, is so light that "you can pick it up with two fingers," says Antony Sheriff, McLaren's managing director.
Instead of the lead-acid battery found in most cars, McLaren used a small lithium-ion battery like those used in hybrids because it's about 22 pounds lighter.
The driver and passenger sit in a carbon-fiber "tub" chassis that offers protection and rigidity but weighs only 160 pounds. The car was designed to not need anti-sway bars.  Even the upward-opening doors feel as though they weigh only a few pounds.
While it's lightweight, it packs a punch. For the U.S. market, the 12C has a twin-turbocharged V-8 paired with a dual-clutch gearbox that rockets the car from 0 to 62 miles per hour in 3.2 seconds and to 124 mph in 9.1. Top speed in the U.S. is 205 mph, slightly more in other markets. And its brakes can haul it down from 62 to 0 in a mere 100 feet.
Gas mileage, of course, is nothing to shout about, but good enough to avoid the federal gas guzzler tax: a rating of 15 miles per gallon of premium in the city, 22 highway, 18 in mixed driving.
"This is about designing a car that's as light and powerful as possible," Sheriff says. "We really have an incredible amount of know-how. We really do sweat the details."
That extends inside, where the instruments were designed for simplicity. There are no buttons on the steering wheel to minimize driver distraction. Air-conditioning and heating controls are on the doors, while powertrain and suspension settings are in the center console to minimize confusion.
The ideas come from McLaren's racing heritage. The company traces its roots to 1964, when New Zealand-born racer Bruce McLaren built his first true sports car, the M1A. More racers followed, with McLaren becoming a star. He died in a racing accident in Goodwood, England, in 1970, but his company raced on.
One of the company's most acclaimed cars was the F1 of 1995. The track version of the car won what McLaren considers racing's triple crown: the Formula 1 world championship, Indianapolis 500 and 24 Hours of Le Mans.
Many lessons of the F1, from carbon-fiber construction to engine design, were incorporated into the MP4-12C. The result is a car that's extremely precise like a racer, though some believe it lacks the kind of personality found in cars such as the Ferrari 458 Italia.
The 12C feels scientific and clinical, says Jonny Lieberman, senior features editor for Motor Trend.  "They are approaching street cars the way you would approach an F1 race."
Lieberman contrasts it with what he calls the rhapsodic way an Italia tugs one's heartstrings. He says that another editor, a classical guitarist, noticed the engine sound even matched notes in major scales while downshifting.
Robert Ross, auto consultant to the posh magazine Robb Report, agrees, saying the MP4-12C is a wonderful car but "almost like a Stepford wife in comparing it to the 458 Italia."
But former Ferrari owner Elliott Dolin of Malibu, Calif., says his new "volcanic orange" MP4-12C "exceeded my expectations."
Beyond its performance, Dolin appreciates how his McLaren gives him a lower profile. "I'm not trying to impress anyone," he says.
McLaren's Sheriff seems just fine with that, saying the car aims to be "aggressive but not overly aggressive."

Health care defenders look to George Washington

BYLINE: Richard Wolf, USA TODAY

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 2A

LENGTH: 880 words

The father of our country could play a key role in defending what opponents of President Obama's health care law call the mother of all mandates.
Seeking precedents for the law's requirement that Americans buy health insurance, some constitutional scholars are reaching back 220 years to a law signed by George Washington: the Militia Act of 1792.
There were two laws, actually, that empowered the president to call up state militias for the purpose of defending the new nation. Those conscripted were required within six months to arm themselves with "a good musket or firelock, a sufficient bayonet and belt, two spare flints, and a knapsack, a pouch, with a box therein, to contain not less than twenty four cartridges, suited to the bore of his musket or firelock, each cartridge to contain a proper quantity of powder and ball." Rifles could be substituted for muskets. 
It's not clear that the Supreme Court will hearken back to the days of knickers and wigs during three days of oral arguments on the health care law next week. Administration lawyers haven't cited the Militia Act in their briefs.
Others who defend the law's constitutionality, however, say it could play a critical role in the case.
"This is the gold standard. You've got George Washington vouching for this law," says Akhil Reed Amar, a professor of constitutional law at Yale Law School. "In my view, it's huge and key."
Going back to the generation that wrote the Constitution makes the precedent even better, adherents say; it shows that the nation's founders had no problem requiring citizens to enter into commerce.
"George Washington thought that a purchase mandate was OK," says Ira Millhiser, a legal policy analyst at the liberal Center for American Progress.
Opponents contend the Militia Act provides no defense for the health care law. In the Constitution, Congress was given the power to raise armies and separately to regulate them. Raising them was controversial, argues Paul Clement, a solicitor general under President George W. Bush who will represent the states challenging the law before the Supreme Court. Arming them, he says, was just a necessary component.
Others argue that the Militia Act applied only to men ages 18 to 45 and that they weren't compelled to purchase their equipment. "It is possible that a man could have inherited a musket, bartered for a knapsack or made his own bullets, and still be in compliance with the act," the Heritage Foundation's Julia Shaw wrote.
For some opponents, the fallacy of the argument is best exemplified by the need to reach back 220 years to find it. "Look where they have to go to try to find a precedent," says Randy Barnett, professor of legal theory at Georgetown University Law Center and one of the lawyers representing the National Federation of Independent Business.
The military draft is one example of compulsory service the health care law's proponents mention to defang the argument that the individual mandate is unprecedented. Government also can impose taxes and require jury duty, they note. If the Militia Act seems too ancient, there are more modern precedents, they argue: Medicare and Social Security. To fund those programs, younger workers are taxed to pay for benefits they won't receive until retirement.

Previous cases cited in dispute
Both sides in the Supreme Court battle over the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act rely on legal precedents to make their case that the requirement to buy insurance is or is not legal under the Constitution's Commerce Clause. Here are the four cases most frequently cited:
Wickard v. Filburn, 1942. The federal government limited wheat production during the Depression to drive up prices. Farmer Roscoe Filburn grew more than his legal allotment, claiming it was for personal use. The government ordered him to destroy the excess crops and pay a fine. The Supreme Court ruled that the government had that authority under the Commerce Clause, because wheat was traded nationally.
United States v. Lopez, 1995.: Alfonso Lopez Jr. carried an unloaded gun into his Texas high school and was charged with violating a federal law regulating guns in or near schools. The government argued that the potential for violence and disturbance of education carried economic impacts. But the Supreme Court ruled that the law was unconstitutional because it did not connect gun possession to interstate commerce. The law was later rewritten.
United States v. Morrison, 2000. Virginia Tech football player Antonio Morrison was not charged with a crime for having sexual contact with a freshman student against her will. She filed suit for a civil remedy under the federal Violence Against Women Act. The Supreme Court invalidated that part of the law, citing the Lopez decision in ruling that gender-based violence had no direct effect on economic activity or interstate commerce.
Gonzales v. Raich, 2005. Federal drug enforcement agents had destroyed the homegrown marijuana supply used by Angel Raich to alleviate pain and, her lawyer argued, save her life. Though California allowed the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes, federal law did not. The Supreme Court upheld the government's raid under the Commerce Clause, ruling that the use of medicinal marijuana affects the interstate market.

French gunman: 'No regret'; 
Police stage raid at suspect's home

BYLINE: The Associated Press

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 9A

LENGTH: 454 words

A Muslim man expressed glee at killing three Jewish children, a rabbi and three French paratroopers as hundreds of police waited outside his apartment in a standoff Wednesday.
Prosecutor Francois Molins said the gunman, Mohamed Merah, was a self-taught, radical Salafi who had been to Afghanistan twice and  trained in the Pakistani militant stronghold of Waziristan. The prosecutor said Merah was planning to kill another soldier imminently, so police had to launch the 3 a.m. raid. 
The suspect "expresses no regret, only that he didn't have time to have more victims. And he even bragged, he said, of bringing France to its knees," Molins said.
The gunman's brother and mother were being detained. Molins said the brother, Abdelkader, had been implicated in a 2007 network that sent militant fighters to Iraq.
Hundreds of police cordoned off the streets around an apartment complex in the city of Toulouse to arrest the 24-year-old Frenchman of Algerian descent. Riot police set off explosions outside his apartment early today in an effort to force his surrender.
Just before police swarmed around the apartment, Merah called a French television journalist and took responsibility for all of the attacks -- saying he carried them out to protest France's ban on veils in public places, the nation's military presence in Afghanistan and in revenge of the deaths of "Palestinian children."
Merah has told police he belonged to al-Qaeda, Interior Minister Claude Gueant said. Molins said Merah's first trip to Afghanistan ended with him being picked up by Afghan police "who turned him over to the American army who put him on the first plane to France."
Merah has a long record as a juvenile delinquent with 15 convictions, Molins added. An Interior Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Merah had been under surveillance for years for having "fundamentalist" Islamic views.
French authorities said Merah threw a Colt .45 handgun used in each of the three attacks out a window in exchange for a device to talk to authorities, but had more weapons, such as an AK-47 assault rifle.
Cedric Delage, regional secretary for a police union, said a key to tracking the suspect was the powerful Yamaha motorcycle that he used in all three attacks, a dark gray one that was stolen March 6. The frame was painted white, the color witnesses saw in the school attack. Delage said one of Merah's brothers went to a motorcycle sales outfit to ask how to modify the GPS tracker, raising suspicions. The vendor contacted police.
Those slain at the Jewish school -- Rabbi Jonathan Sandler; his sons, Arieh, 5, and Gabriel, 3; and 8-year-old Myriam Monsenego, all of French-Israeli nationality -- were buried in Israel on Wednesday.

Outraged public calls for Fla. police chief's firing; 
'No confidence' vote follows teen's killing

BYLINE: Kevin Johnson and Larry Copeland, USA TODAY

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 2A

LENGTH: 434 words

The fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin is bringing heated calls for the resignation of the local police chief, and the city's commissioners voted "no confidence" in the chief Wednesday night. 
The commission voted 3-2 against Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee but can't fire him because the police chief reports to the city manager. City Manager Norton Bonaparte  told the commissioners he would take their vote under advisement.
Earlier in the day, calls for  firing Lee  were met with standing ovations at an NAACP meeting here aimed at addressing outrage over the killing of 17-year-old Trayvon. The unarmed youth was shot Feb. 26 as he was returning to a gated community  after buying candy at a convenience store.
The gunman, Neighborhood Watch captain George Zimmerman, has not been charged  and has said he shot the teen in self-defense. Zimmerman had been following the youth on foot and  called the police department to report possible suspicious behavior, but he said he lost sight of Trayvon and was returning to his truck when he was  attacked. Police said Zimmerman is white; his family says he is Hispanic.
"Any police chief who has so mishandled a situation like this has to go," NAACP national head Benjamin Jealous said. "We will ensure that justice is carried out here in Sanford."
Lee didn't respond to an interview request. Mayor Jeff Triplett said  the city was standing by its chief for "right now."
Triplett said there were "conversations" involving the chief's status as recently as Wednesday morning.
"My (preference) is to wait until everything comes in and make a decision based on the facts," Triplett told USA TODAY. "But as you know, things can change very quickly. If we've done something wrong, we'll hold people accountable. That means everybody. We'll act swiftly. But as of right now, I'm standing with the city manager."
Bonaparte defended the police department's decision to not charge Zimmerman immediately after the shooting. "Zimmerman's statement was that he had lost sight of Trayvon and was returning to his truck to meet the police officer when he says he was attacked by Trayvon," the city manager wrote in an open letter on the Sanford municipal website.
"Mr. Zimmerman was not acting outside the legal boundaries of Florida Statute by carrying his weapon when this incident occurred," he wrote.
Trayvon's parents told  hundreds of people at a march Wednesday night in New York City that they won't stop until they get justice for him.
"My son did not deserve to die," said the teen's father, Tracy Martin.
Johnson reported from Washington. Contributing: The Associated Press.

Laws allowing self-defense killings at crux of firestorm

BYLINE: Yamiche Alcindor

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 2A

LENGTH: 490 words

The Trayvon Martin tragedy is shining a national spotlight on "stand your ground" laws in at least 21 states.
The laws -- in places such as Texas, Idaho and Alaska -- allow everyday citizens to use deadly force against someone else if they fear for their life. They also say people do not have to retreat if threatened or attacked. 
George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watchman in Sanford, Fla., fatally shot Trayvon as the 17-year-old was walking to his father's home. Zimmerman told police he was attacked by Trayvon and acted in self-defense. He has not been arrested or charged.
The case has triggered  public outcry to change or repeal Florida's "stand your ground" law.
"You want to know how you can kill somebody legally in Florida?" said Arthur Hayhoe of the Florida Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. "Make sure you have no witnesses, hunt the person down and then say you feared for your life."
Hayhoe said he has about a dozen cases on his desk now similar to Trayvon's case.
Florida's "stand your ground" law emerged after a man shot and killed a burglar who officials say was trying to break into the man's RV after Hurricane Ivan in 2005. The man waited months before learning he would not be charged with murder.
The case inspired then-Florida state senator Durell Peaden, a Republican, to introduce a bill dealing with similar situations. State Rep. Dennis Baxley, the bill's House sponsor, told USA TODAY the law empowers people to defend themselves and should not be challenged in the wake of this case.
"Every time you have an adverse incident, immediately the anti-gun faction will say this law is the problem," said Baxley, a Republican, adding that violent crime in Florida has dropped since its implementation.
"The perpetrators know everyone has the right to defend themselves.  I think that has been a strong deterrent," Baxley said.
Since the law was enacted in 2005, the number of justifiable homicides in Florida has skyrocketed, said state Sen. Oscar Braynon, a Democrat who represents the area in Miami where Trayvon lived with his mother.
Nationally, justifiable homicides  have been slowly rising since 2005. The number in 2010, the last full year measured by the FBI, was 278.
Baxley thinks the jump  shows the law is working. "The perpetrator suffered instead of the person they were victimizing," he said. "That's what those numbers mean."
Some gun-control advocates say the numbers underscore an increasingly aggressive mentality on the streets, fueled in part by state laws such as Florida's.
"It's part of this increasing effort to push more guns into more public places," said Daniel Vice of the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence.
Braynon and Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, have said they support a review of the law.
"It's been great for defense lawyers," said Richard Rosenbaum, a  Fort Lauderdale attorney. "It has helped a lot of people get off on self-defense that would have been found guilty before 2005."

How many deployments are too many?

BYLINE: Gregg Zoroya, USA TODAY

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 420 words

After nearly 11 years of war and hundreds of millions of dollars in research on the mental health of troops, the military is no closer to understanding how many deployments are too many for individual servicemembers, researchers say. 
Military leaders have said the nation has never fought wars this long with this small of a military, deploying troops over and over. Yet questions remain about how many times a soldier can recycle into combat without psychological harm.
"I think it's definitely disappointing that we don't know. I wish we did," says retired Navy captain William Nash, a psychiatrist studying resiliency within Marine battalions.
The issue of multiple deployments was one of many raised following the March 11 massacre of 16 civilians in Afghanistan. The suspect, U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales, 38, was on his fourth  deployment when the shootings occurred.
Many of the issues reported about Bales -- repeated combat exposure, physical injuries and personal finance and career problems -- are common stresses on troops, scientists say. Yet 107,000 servicemembers have deployed three or more times without incident.
"The question we don't have answered is how do we get precision about picking out the people who are really going to be in trouble," says Shelley MacDermid Wadsworth, director of the Military Family Research  Institute at Purdue University.
Scores of studies have looked at the wars' effects on behavior and mental health. But the work has been done "in piecemeal fashion," offering a snapshot analysis of a group of servicemembers,  says Terri Tanielian, a senior research analyst at RAND Corp., a think tank.
The Pentagon may have missed a chance to follow large numbers of combat troops through the war in what is called a longitudinal study to better understand how behavioral problems develop, Tanielian, Wadsworth and Nash say.
Col. Paul Bliese, an Army scientist, agrees about the lack of a longitudinal study, but he and the others say important analysis is ongoing. For instance, a series of Army field studies of combat troops co-led by Bliese  produced waves of data underscoring a link between deployments and post-traumatic stress disorder.
Most promising, researchers say, is a 21-year longitudinal study  by the Navy  looking at how military life impacts mental and physical health. Although not tailored specifically to the conflicts to come, 80,000 troops enrolled in the study have deployed and important findings are emerging, says  Nancy Crum-Cianflone, the study's director.

Bales to face 17 murder charges in Afghan spree; 
Defense lawyer says 'war is on trial' in soldier's case

BYLINE: Donna Leinwand Leger and Jim Michaels, USA TODAY

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 2A

LENGTH: 388 words

Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales will be charged with 17 counts of murder in connection with a shooting spree in an Afghan village that left women and children dead and severely tested U.S.-Afghan relations, a U.S. official said. The official declined to be identified because the charges have not been publicly released yet. 
Bales will also face six counts of attempted murder and six counts of aggravated assault, as well as dereliction of duty and other violations of military law, the Associated Press reported, citing an unidentified U.S official.
Bales is being held in a solitary cell in the military prison at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas. The charges are to be read to him  today.
Bales, who was on his fourth combat tour, allegedly sneaked from his military outpost in Kandahar province at 3 a.m. March 11 and walked to two villages where he shot, stabbed and burned villagers, including nine children.
The military originally said Bales was suspected in the killing of 16 Afghan villagers, but changed that Thursday to 17, raising the number of adults by one but without explaining why.
The massacre  followed the accidental burnings of  Qurans at a U.S. base in Afghanistan, which touched off waves of deadly rioting. No one has suggested a motive for the shootings, but the massacre has highlighted the issues of combat stress and frequent deployments.
Bales, 38, joined the Army on Nov. 8, 2001, two months after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Friends say he was driven by patriotism, but Bales' financial businesses had gone bust, and regulators were  investigating him for allegedly bilking an Ohio couple of their retirement savings.
He deployed three times to Iraq before  Afghanistan.  During his second deployment, he fought in  Najaf to recover a downed  helicopter. His platoon leader praised him,  and in a newspaper article, Bales recalled it as one of his proudest moments. He arrived in Afghanistan in December. His unit  provided  security at a small outpost.
Two days before the killings, one of Bales' fellow soldiers lost a leg after stepping on a  mine, said John Henry Browne, Bales' civilian attorney. Bales also suffered a minor head injury in 2010 as a passenger in a Humvee that flipped, Browne said. "I'm not putting the war on trial, but the war is on trial," Browne said.

Florida case costs police chief; 
He says he'll 'temporarily remove' himself from job; new prosecutor appointed

BYLINE: Yamiche Alcindor, Larry Copeland

LENGTH: 617 words

SANFORD, Fla. - The embattled police chief overseeing the Trayvon Martin investigation said Thursday he will "temporarily remove" himself from his job amid mounting criticism and pressure to charge a neighborhood watch leader with killing the teenager.
A few hours later, the local prosecutor, Norman Wolfinger, stepped down from handling the case, and Gov. Rick Scott appointed another state attorney to handle the investigation.
Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee said that he stands by his department's initial investigation but that he is stepping aside to avoid being a distraction. The case has been drawing widespread national coverage amid claims that Trayvon, who is black, was a victim of racial stereotyping. 
"It is apparent that my role in this matter is overshadowing the process," Lee said at a news conference, adding that he felt he should remove himself from his post "in the hopes of restoring some semblance of calm to the city, which has been in turmoil for several weeks."
Wolfinger, the local state attorney, said in a letter to the governor that his recusal from the case was aimed at "toning down the rhetoric and preserving the integrity of the investigation." Scott  appointed Angela  Corey, the state attorney for the Jacksonville area, to take the case.
Trayvon, 17, was shot Feb. 26 as he was returning to a gated community after buying candy at a convenience store. The gunman, neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, has not been charged and  said he shot the unarmed youth in self-defense.
The 911 calls paint a confusing picture  and it is unclear who was the aggressor  between Trayvon and Zimmerman. A 911 caller said  he saw a man on the ground screaming for help, according to a recording  on Sanford's municipal website.
The caller turned to hold back his dog and then he heard the gunshot and the screaming stopped.
Zimmerman, who police say is white but whose family says he is Hispanic, had been following the teen on foot and called the police department to report possible suspicious behavior. Zimmerman said he lost sight of Trayvon and was returning to his truck when he was attacked.
City Manager Norton Bonaparte  said a search would begin immediately for an interim chief. Before Lee's announcement, Bonaparte told USA TODAY that he would await the  investigations  by the Justice Department  and the Florida state attorney's office before deciding Lee's fate. "I want to know if there were things they should have done that they didn't do, or things they did that they shouldn't have done," Bonaparte said.
On Wednesday,  the Sanford City Commission voted  3-2 that it had "no confidence" in Lee.
NAACP President Benjamin Jealous said outside  City Hall that Lee "needs to step down, not just step aside."
Thousands of people gathered at a rally Thursday night in downtown Sanford, where many of the nation's best-known black activists demanded the arrest of Zimmerman.
"Zimmerman should have been arrested that night," said  Al Sharpton, president of the National Action Network. Among those with  Sharpton  were Martin Luther King III, activist  Dick Gregory  and former New York governor David Patterson.
Earlier this week, Lee said in an e-mail to USA TODAY there have been "assumptions and conclusions"  that are based on limited information.
The initial police report of the incident says an officer noticed that Zimmerman showed apparent signs of being in a struggle. "I could observe that his back appeared to be wet and was covered in grass, as if he had been laying on his back on the ground. Zimmerman was also bleeding from the nose and back of his head," the  report said.
Alcindor and Bello reported from McLean, Va. Contributing: The Associated Press.

Heartbreakers help define Kentucky, too; 
Along with 7 championships come handful of tough losses

BYLINE: Mike Lopresti, USA TODAY

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 1C

LENGTH: 1586 words

Kentucky basketball has so many championship stories to tell. Want to hear them? Sorry, you've come to the wrong place.
This, instead, is the Wildcats' trail of torment. They can claim seven national titles -- maybe an eighth one day soon -- but also a dramatic knack for landing on the painful side of history.  The Kentucky aura, so much on gaudy display again this season, comes with a striking number of memorable what-ifs.
"The best four years of my life as far as developing what I needed to develop as a person and as a man," Pat Riley called his Lexington days, before he headed off to coach NBA champions. But one night during those four years was crushing, and he is far from alone among former Wildcats.
Someone has to lose unforgettable games. 
Kentucky was the team that Duke and Christian Laettner's last-gasp turnaround jump shot beat 20 years ago, in what many still call the Mount Everest of college basketball games.
"You can't help but see it, if you're going to watch college basketball or sports," said Sean Woods, who scored the almost-winning shot in that  East Regional.  "Am I proud to be a player in that game? Yeah. But at the end of the day, we still lost."
Kentucky was the victim in John Wooden's last game, with the UCLA Bruins desperate to send their Wizard out a winner in 1975.
"The day before the finals, John Wooden announced that he would retire after the game," said Joe B. Hall, the coach of those Wildcats. "I felt like somebody had stuck a pin in me and let all of the air out."
"I had 34 points, and it meant nothing to me," Kevin Grevey said. "The agony. The pain. It's hard to even talk about it."
Kentucky was the team that had eight more field goals, did not allow a basket in overtime and still lost the  championship  to Arizona in 1997.
"If you're on the losing end, you're always going to regret those things," said Scott Padgett, who had 17 points in an 84-79 Kentucky defeat. "I don't know when that regret stops. It's 15 years later, and I won one the next year, and I'm still upset."
Co-stars to history
Kentucky's players were the co-stars the night Texas Western, now Texas-El Paso, changed the game and society by winning a national title game with five African-American starters.
"We didn't think about what the game meant," said Riley, who had 19 points for the Wildcats that historic day  in 1966. "Now when I look back at it, I realize how much the game mattered.
"The night of the loss, it was simply misery."
Even last year, Kentucky was the team that would have derailed Connecticut's remarkable journey from No. 9 seed in the Big East tournament to national champion, if only for a few free throws. How frustrating was it to lose a shot at the title, losing in the Final Four  56-55 after going 4-for-12 from the line?
"I can't change it," Brandon Knight said. "Why be frustrated about it?"
The message? Kentucky has won a gaggle of titles, but look how many more the Wildcats almost won. And when they fell short, so often something special happened.
The darkest example came 20 years ago in the East Regional final. Laettner's shot to win for Duke 104-103, after a 75-foot pass from Grant Hill, was the fifth lead change in the last 31.5 seconds of overtime.
Had the pass been less precise, had the shot been less magical, had Laettner been an instant slower  Woods' one-handed banker in  heavy traffic  -- giving Kentucky a 103-102 lead with 2.1 seconds left -- would have been the most dramatic winning moment in the Wildcats' enormous pantheon of memories.
"Major disbelief," remembered Woods, who coached Mississippi Valley State into this year's NCAA tournament. "You're in a daze. You want to wake up."
Laettner trespassed over everything. He put up 20 shots that night, 10 from the field and 10 from the line, and made them all. That's what it took to beat a Kentucky team that had already defied the odds, rising from the ashes of probation to push mighty Duke.
"Nationally, it's something people will never forget because of the game," Woods said. "Kentucky-wise, they remember what we did at that  time."
Has he ever watched a tape of it?
"One time. Years ago."
Ever want to see it again?
"No."
It lingers, anyway.
"A man's biggest fear is going through life without a purpose or anybody remembering him or something that he did and was a part of. I'm just blessed to be a part of something that people will remember forever."
So is Riley.
Texas Western's 72-65 win against  Kentucky in the 1966 national championship game had none of the back-and-forth of 1992 -- the Miners were in control all game  -- but much more social impact. The 2006 movie Glory Road portrayed the hard path of racism  Texas Western's players endured.
And the game was never the same after their championship against all-white Kentucky.
"We were playing against a lot more than just a team for the national championship," Riley said. "We didn't find out about their motivation and their incentive and their will and their desire until 40 years later.
"But I remember during the course of the game I could just sense, you could look in their eyes, they were playing for something bigger. I don't know if even those players at Texas Western realized the significance of that game at the time. Years later, they know."
On the first play, Texas Western's David Lattin took a lob pass and slammed a dunk over Riley. Some stories afterward had Lattin barking at Riley, "Take that, you honky!"
"If he didn't say it, he felt it," Riley said. "He did grunt some words.
"He made a statement. He just wanted to let us know that they were there for real that night."
The Wooden effect
Nine years later, another statement would haunt Kentucky -- Wooden announcing that the 1975 championship game would be his last at UCLA.
Grevey first got the word at the San Diego Zoo on Easter Sunday, the day before the  game. The Wildcats, who had taken out No. 1 and unbeaten Indiana in the regional, had gone to San Diego to enjoy themselves, and to win. But everything had changed.
Grevey, now a restaurant owner in Falls Church, Va., remembers his father telling him the morning of the game that the oddsmakers had dropped Kentucky from a four- or five-point favorite to a one-point favorite.
"That was my first glimmer that maybe this does have some meaning," Grevey said. "He probably shouldn't have told me that. We had to play in their backyard in San Diego, and on the night that John Wooden retires. So we were, I guess, at a much bigger disadvantage than any of us ever thought."
UCLA gave Wooden his 10th title as a retirement present 92-85, despite Grevey's 34 points. Hall remembers a technical foul against UCLA late in the game, and Grevey having to wait to shoot the free throws while the officials tried to soothe an angry Wooden.
"Coach Wooden came out nearly to the free throw circle, objecting to the technical. The referee was Bob Wortman, and he very politely, like he would help his father off the floor, gently had the elbow of Coach Wooden and said, 'Please, Mr. Wooden, go back to your bench.'  Coach Wooden wouldn't go.
"I walked to the scorer's table and told Wortman to let (Grevey) shoot his free throws, and he pointed to me and said, 'If you don't get back to that bench, I'm going to call a technical.' So I knew I was not in home territory."
Grevey was long haunted by that night. "There are not too many days in your life that you would do whatever it takes to win, and then when you lose, you almost wish you never got there."
It was still in his mind three years later, when he helped the Washington Bullets beat the Seattle SuperSonics in Game 7 of the 1978 NBA Finals. "We're a huge underdog on the Sonics' home floor," he said. "And I'm like, 'It ain't happening this time.'"
Hall had one other postscript with Wooden, whom he regarded as a close friend to the day Wooden died.
"He and Kevin Grevey happened to be on a plane sitting side by side, maybe 10 years later, and Kevin told Coach Wooden, 'I really believed we would have won the game had you not announced your retirement.' And Coach Wooden said, 'Kevin, you would have won the game if you had played better defense.'"
Defense wasn't a problem in the 1997 title game, when Kentucky held Arizona to 37.9%  shooting and no field goals in overtime. But a 34-9 deficit at the free throw line helped doom the Wildcats in Rick Pitino's last game.
"They were a team that was aggressive, and we pressed a lot and they did a good job of attacking," Padgett said. "In a game that close, I would never say it was the referees."
Padgett remembers all the little turning points that might have turned out differently. He recited several, then paused and said, "You're probably  thinking I'm sick, because that was 1997 and this is 2012, and I remember things like it was yesterday."
Padgett helped Kentucky and new coach Tubby Smith to the school's seventh championship in 1998. Even that didn't erase the bitterness. "I think about that 1997 game probably more than '98," he said.
The near-misses: '66, '75, '92, '97. Last season, too. Had the Wildcats beaten Connecticut, they would have had a strong shot against Butler in the final.  "I think guys would have found a way to dig in for the last game," said Knight, now a Detroit Pistons rookie.
History would look so different with that much blue.
"I don't think these kids now with Kentucky have a clue about what kind of tradition there is," Woods said. "To us, it was everything."
A tradition of famous triumph, but also agony that not even time can cure. Kentucky basketball is not one without the other.

In 'Raid: Redemption,' action is everything; 
Fists, firepower keep it moving

BYLINE: Scott Bowles, USA TODAY

SECTION: LIFE; Pg. 3D

LENGTH: 409 words

Watching the men of The Raid: Redemption  is  like watching boys getting hyper in a treehouse: You know the roughhousing will get out of control.
Unapologetically brutal and unencumbered by much plot, Raid is the year's most turbo-charged film, an Indonesian martial-arts movie that ups the violence by giving its characters a modern-day worldview -- and weaponry. 
The result is a corpse-fest that makes Quentin Tarantino look restrained. Directed by Welsh-born Gareth Evans, who is making a cult name for himself in Indonesian martial-arts movies, Raid is more a nod to Bruce Lee than John Woo. Though there is some beautiful cinematography, Evans is more interested in fisticuffs.
Raid: Redemption  takes place almost entirely in a squalid tenement building, where members of a young special-forces police unit are to arrest drug kingpin Tama (a wonderful Ray Sahetapy).
Tama, who oversees his hideout from a top-floor bank of video monitors and may have been tipped off by a squirrelly Lt. Wahyu (Pierre Gruno), turns the tables. He seals the building and announces that any resident who helps slaughter the officers can live at the ghetto for life, rent-free.
It's all bullets and groin kicks from there. Led by shining-knight cop Rama (Iko Uwais),  the team tries to ascend staircase after staircase to reach Tama.
The ingredients could be a recipe for martial-arts fruitcake. No character has a back story besides what he utters  between skirmishes. And some action moves so fast as to be a blur of bone breaks.
But Evans infuses Raid with a logic that works. These aren't undercover cops looking to settle the score: This is a  team of nervous kids. And given the choice, the officers go for a gun or blade before they resort to hand-to-hand combat.
Yes, there are martial-arts conventions. Punches cut through the air like ceiling fans and land like mini-grenades. Women are either pregnant  or poor and panic-stricken. And wouldn't someone call the police (or at least a TV station) when a building is engulfed in artillery fire?
But that's reasoning for more cerebral fare. By shooting in real time and keeping his stars cooped up in a single setting, Evans has created a pressure cooker of a picture.

In Trayvon's death, ugly echoes

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 10A

LENGTH: 526 words

From the Olive Street Baptist Church in Sanford, Fla., to New York's Union Square, last month's fatal shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin has tapped into a deep vein of distrust among African Americans. 
At the Baptist church in Martin's hometown, stories of violence and hurt poured out from other black mothers and grandmothers. The Internet was alive with a Change.org petition demanding justice for the slain youth. Hundreds marched in Manhattan on Wednesday and rallied in Sanford on Thursday to protest the killing.
How could it be otherwise?
Throughout the nation's history, black men, women and children have been targeted, beaten, lynched and shot, often for a wrong word or look or just being in the wrong place. Police seldom bothered to investigate.  Most died in obscurity.
Once in a great while, though, their deaths made a difference. In 1955, Emmett Till, a 14-year-old visiting Money, Miss., was yanked from his bed, shot in the head and dumped in a river after he supposedly whistled at a white woman. Till's killers were acquitted by an all-white jury. The uproar over the injustice helped feed a fledgling civil rights movement.
Today, Americans of all races hear echoes of those deaths. While much  remains unknown and new facts could emerge, the Trayvon Martin tragedy carries many of the classic earmarks of racial bias. Despite all of the nation's progress in burying its racist past, minorities are still commonly stopped by authorities for no other reason than the color of their skin. Try to find an African-American man who hasn't been stopped for "driving while black."
Martin, it appears, made the mistake of "walking while black."
The details have been widely reported: On Feb. 26, Martin had just come from a convenience store with some Skittles and an iced tea. He was walking in the Retreat at Twin Lakes, a gated community in the Orlando suburb of Sanford that had seen a recent rash of burglaries and thefts. He had on a hoodie, perhaps against the drizzly night. He was heading for the home of his father's girlfriend.
Neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, driving his SUV, spotted the teen and called 911. "This guy looks like he's up to no good or he's on drugs or something," Zimmerman told a dispatcher. Armed with a gun, Zimmerman said he was following the guy. The dispatcher told him not to.
Zimmerman didn't listen. He left the safety of his vehicle. After a confrontation of some sort, he shot the unarmed Martin dead. Zimmerman has said it was self-defense. Sanford police didn't press charges.
It might well have ended there, but for a slowly building firestorm, fueled by black celebrities and columnists and social media. On Thursday, the Sanford police chief temporarily, and appropriately, stepped aside. Local prosecutors are now investigating Martin's death. So are the FBI and the Justice Department.
While authorities complete their investigations, a couple of questions are  worth pondering. Would Zimmerman have thought a white teen in a hoodie looked like he "was up to no good"?  And, most pointedly, if Zimmerman were black and had shot a white, unarmed 17-year-old, would police have let him go?

Fox duo break down Bristol, Junior, more

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 9C

LENGTH: 833 words

Four weeks into the NASCAR season, several questions have emerged -- from how to bring fans back to Bristol Motor Speedway to what's going on with Kasey Kahne. Fox Sports analysts Darrell Waltrip and Larry McReynolds, who will help call Sunday's race at Auto Club Speedway, shared their answers on those topics and more with USA TODAY's Dustin Long:
Q: With the talk about the racing at Bristol and track owner Bruton Smith considering changes to the track to bring back fans, what do you think should be done? 
Waltrip: The product that we see at Bristol right now is the best it's ever been. The racing is fantastic. I don't know, short of going in and tearing up the track and rebuilding it, I'm not real sure how they could change it all that much. Let's work with Goodyear, and let's see if Goodyear can come up with a little softer tire to give the cars a little more grip.  The other thing that I think would be a big value to the speedway is do something for the fans. A lot of them say the gas prices are high, hotel is high, food is high. I'd drop ticket prices; I'd drop camping prices.
Q: Kasey Kahne is 32nd in points after four races and has had three finishes of 29th or worse in his first season with Hendrick Motorsports. How worried should he be about his Chase for the Sprint Cup hopes at this time?
McReynolds: As the country song goes, it's still a long way to Richmond. The good news for Kasey Kahne, (crew chief) Kenny Francis and that No. 5 team is that they've got speed. They just absolutely have no luck. But are they possibly making a little bit of their luck? Sure they are. That (crash) at Bristol was totally uncalled-for. They're 23 laps into a 500-lap race, and you're going to push the envelope that quick, knowing you've got a pretty good race car? I've watched him every single race. He moves forward. I don't know what's going on with Kasey, but it almost makes me wonder, is he trying too hard?
Q: Dale Earnhardt Jr. has been involved in two incidents the last two races -- one with Mark Martin in Las Vegas and one with teammate Jeff Gordon at Bristol. Is he showing a more aggressive side this year, or are these incidents much ado about nothing?
Waltrip: The thing at Vegas was uncalled-for. Mark Martin has a reputation for moving out of people's way. Junior had an expectation; Mark didn't live up to it. And I think it frustrated Junior a little bit, and he ran into Mark. Really and truly, it was uncalled-for. It shouldn't have happened. What happened at Bristol (Earnhardt's tailpipe cutting Gordon's tire), that's just racing. You can't blame Junior.
Q: What kind of impact will there be on the garage of Hendrick Motorsports after winning its appeal of the penalties to Jimmie Johnson's team?
McReynolds: I've got to believe that everybody in that garage feels the same way that I feel: very, very confused.  I would just love to have two minutes with John Middlebrook (the chief appellate officer who rescinded some of the penalties against Hendrick) and just say: Tell me what justified giving (Johnson's 25) points back and rescinding (crew chief Chad Knaus') suspension but keeping (Knaus') $100,000 fine?
Q: In the first four Cup races of this season, there has been a restrictor-plate track, a 1-mile track, a 1.5-mile speedway and a short track. What have these races shown you?
McReynolds: It honestly seems to be the theme and what we had in 2011 in a year we had 18 different winners in 36 races. No one team, no one operation seemed to be dominant.
Waltrip: Every team seems to have a strength. (Points leader Greg) Biffle seems to have his arms around all the different racetracks. At this point, I don't think anybody has a dominant car. I don't think anybody is a dominant driver.
Q: With the series heading to Auto Club Speedway this weekend, drivers will compete at a 2-mile track, then a short track (Martinsville Speedway) and a pair of 1.5-mile tracks afterward (Texas Motor Speedway and Kansas Speedway). What will you be watching the next few weeks?
McReynolds: I'm continuing to observe and watch closer and closer the 99 car. Carl (Edwards), it's still early and I don't want to have a knee-jerk reaction here, but I'm a son of a gun if they aren't starting to take a little bit of a look that Denny Hamlin and the 11 team had last year after losing the 2010 championship. They may bust out this week and lead a bunch of laps and win the race.
Waltrip: Now that Jimmie and Chad have gotten their penalties overturned, they really look like they've got their act together.  The Fords really had everybody smoked at Daytona, not so much since. The Fords ought to be really good this weekend at Fontana. Jeff Gordon is struggling. I thought (Joe Gibbs Racing) had their arms around their problems but apparently not.  Tony Stewart is showing he's in championship form. Kevin Harvick is looking pretty good.

Three plead guilty in fatal hate crime

BYLINE: Kevin Johnson, USA TODAY

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 361 words

Just  days after the Justice Department launched an  investigation into the fatal shooting of an unarmed Florida teenager, three white men pleaded guilty Thursday to federal hate crime charges stemming from  the horrific June 2011 murder of a 47-year-old black Mississippi man who was beaten and then run over by a pickup. 
Assistant Attorney General Tom Perez said Deryl Dedmon, 19; John Rice, 19; and Dylan Butler, 20, made "a sport of attacking African Americans" in the Jackson, Miss., area before they were linked to the fatal  assault on auto worker James Craig Anderson.
Dedmon also pleaded guilty in state court Wednesday in connection with the murder and was  given two life sentences. Rice has been charged by state authorities with assault.  Butler has not been charged in state court. A state investigation continues.
Perez said the federal charges, which carry a maximum penalty of life in prison, mark the first time authorities have invoked the federal hate crime statute -- known as the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act -- in a case resulting in a victim's death. Shepard and Byrd were both victims in high-profile hate cases.
The Justice Department announced Monday it was reviewing events surrounding the February shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by Sanford, Fla., Neighborhood Watch volunteer George Zimmerman, who said he was acting in self-defense. Zimmerman has not been charged  in the case, which has  sparked outrage in Florida and demonstrations in other parts of the U.S.
In the Anderson case, Perez said the investigation revealed  evidence of a racially motivated attack in which the three Mississippi men set out to "harass and assault African Americans" in the early morning hours of June 26, 2011.
About 5 a.m., according to court documents, the suspects encountered Anderson in a motel parking lot, where they severely beat him. Rice and Butler, according to court documents, were the first to leave the scene, driving away in a Jeep from which one of them  yelled, "White power!"
Dedmon and two others  then got into a Ford F-250 truck and ran over Anderson, killing him, according to court documents.

Bales' lawyer seen as 'gladiator' for his high-profile clients; 
Seattle-based Browne uses the prosecution's weaknesses for leverage

BYLINE: Byron Acohido

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 4A

LENGTH: 922 words

At 6-foot-6, with long hair and often sporting his trademark white scarf, Seattle criminal defense attorney John Henry Browne cuts a commanding figure.
Browne, 65,  is heading the defense of Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales, who is facing 17 counts of murder in the March 11 slayings of 17 Afghan civilians.
Browne's  professional persona has been cultivated over 40 years of defending people accused of heinous crimes. He can be at once charming and combative or somber and theatrical,  peers and rivals say. 
"What we see John doing on this national scale is what he has done many times in Seattle," says Dan Satterberg,  King County prosecutor.  "What he's doing early is maybe the most important thing that any defense attorney can do, and that is to humanize his client."
Browne is a meticulous legal tactician with a talent for flushing out  weakness in the prosecution's case. He has done it throughout his  career, which includes defending serial killer Ted Bundy and teenage thief Colton Harris-Moore, the "Barefoot Bandit."
In one  case, he defended an Eagle Scout arrested in a Seattle apartment where the Scout had  bludgeoned a man to death. Browne wove together a complex self-defense claim and got prosecutors to drop first-degree murder charges. In another case, defending a doctor accused of murdering his wife and a neighbor, Browne attacked the credibility of a key prosecution witness by unrolling the man's rap sheet across the courtroom floor.
"John is a gladiator," says Seattle defense attorney John Muenster, who worked alongside Browne in the Seattle public defenders office in the 1970s. "He embraces the courtroom and understands the importance of letting the public know, especially in a high-profile case, what the case is all about and who his client is."
Last week, even before the military disclosed Bales' identity, Browne set in motion a sympathetic narrative. At a news conference he described a phone call in which he said his client sounded "shocked" and "distant," adding that the soldier did not recall "a lot of the facts that are being alleged."
Browne has served notice that he intends to construct a backstop defense to spare Bales from  the death penalty, says Eugene Fidell, a former U.S. Coast Guard judge advocate general who teaches military justice at Yale. The idea is to convince a military jury that mitigating circumstances, such as post-traumatic stress disorder or a traumatic brain injury, justify a lesser penalty of life in prison without  parole.
"Victory involves heading off a death sentence," Fidell says. "That means intensive review of everything there is to know about his client's background and conduct."
Browne has used brain injury as a mitigating circumstance in a mass murder case before. In 1983, Benjamin Ng was convicted as the trigger man in 11 of 13 assassination-style shootings at the Wah Mee gambling club in Seattle. Browne introduced evidence during the penalty phase of the trial showing that Ng suffered from brain damage, persuading the jury to spare him from the death penalty.
Seattle criminal defense attorney Richard Hansen, who also worked with Browne as a public defender, says Browne opposes the death penalty.
Browne has  begun constructing a  defense. Following two meetings with Bales at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., he met with reporters Tuesday  and questioned the quality of evidence  military prosecutors appear to hold against Bales.
The Army insists that everything  points to one shooter: Bales. However, no details about how the massacre was carried out have been released. The Afghan investigative team  is not convinced that a lone soldier is responsible, according to the Associated Press.
"I don't know about the evidence in this case," Browne said. "I don't know that the government is going to prove much. There's no forensic evidence. There's no confession.
"I'm certainly not saying that we're not taking responsibility for this in the right way, at the right time. But for now, I'm interested in what the evidence is," he said. "It's not like a crime scene in the United States."
"The war's on trial," Browne said. "I'm not putting the war on trial, but the war is on trial."
Military law experts say the prosecution faces  several daunting challenges. For one, it has proved difficult to recover forensic evidence,  even basic identifications of the victims, who were quickly buried according to custom. And getting eyewitnesses, especially Afghan villagers terrified of the U.S. military, to travel to the U.S. to testify in court may be problematic.
None of this has escaped Browne, says Philip Cave, a retired U.S. Navy judge advocate general who has a military law practice in Washington, D.C.
"It's very wise for him at this stage of the case to want to challenge every single thing," Cave says.  "He's educating the prosecution that this is not a slam-dunk case, that it's likely to be time-consuming and expensive."
Browne might be able to persuade the prosecution to "take the death penalty off the table" because of the difficulties in retrieving evidence,  Cave says.
Lawyer Bill Marler, who commutes by ferry with Browne to Seattle from Bainbridge Island, says one thing is certain: The crusading attorney will give Bales a vigorous defense.
"Anybody who is good at what he does wants to be in the middle of whatever is the biggest and the best," Marler observes. "John's the kind of guy who takes on a case based on the conviction that everyone deserves to have their constitutional protections watched over."

Florida case rings across pulpits; 
Faith leaders call for justice for teen

BYLINE: William M. Welch, USA TODAY

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 397 words

Calls for legal action in the shooting death of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin are growing as preachers took to their pulpits wearing "hoodies" in symbolic solidarity  around the country. 
One month after the death of the unarmed 17-year-old African American by a neighborhood watch  volunteer in Sanford, Fla.,  civil rights activist Jesse Jackson said the youth was a "martyr" whose death could be an opportunity to revive concerns about civil rights and violence. He called for a change in Florida's "Stand Your Ground" self-defense law, similar to one in more than 20 other states, that may have prevented charges from being filed in the case.
"How do we turn pain into power?" Jackson asked a standing-room only congregation  while preaching at Macedonia Missionary Baptist Church in Eatonville, Fla., about 20 miles from the site of the Sanford shooting. "How do we go from a moment to a movement that curries favor?
"The blood of the innocent has power," Jackson said, naming other slain black Americans whose deaths became rallying cries in the struggle for equality. "There's power in the blood of Emmett Till. There's power in the blood of Medgar Evers. There's power in the blood of Dr. King."
Concern over the killing was echoed in religious centers from Atlanta to New York and California, with many preachers and their congregations wearing hooded sweatshirts in Martin's memory.
Trayvon was wearing a hooded sweatshirt as he walked home on a rainy night in a gated community. The neighborhood watch volunteer who shot him, George Zimmerman, 28, has not been charged, and demands for an arrest have been growing. The chief of the city's police force stepped aside last week amid criticism.
In Northern California, "Hoodie Sunday" was marked in hundreds of congregations including those in Oakland, Berkeley, San Jose and Sacramento, organizers said.
"As faith leaders, we are outraged that the killer showed so little regard for Trayvon that he took his life needlessly and senselessly," the group, PICO, a network of faith-based community organizations, said in a statement. "We are outraged that local law enforcement officials have failed to act justly and expeditiously."
Zimmerman had called police to report that a hooded figure in the neighborhood looked suspicious. Trayvon turned out to be carrying  a bag of candy and a can of iced tea.

U.S. pays Afghans in massacre

The U.S. paid $50,000 in compensation for each villager killed and $11,000 for each person wounded in a shooting rampage allegedly carried out by a rogue American soldier in southern Afghanistan, Afghan officials said Sunday. 
The families of the dead received the money Saturday at the governor's office, Kandahar provincial council member Agha Lalai said.  Community elder Jan Agha confirmed the payout amounts.
Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales, 38, is accused of sneaking off his base March 11 and  firing on families as they slept in their homes in two nearby villages. U.S. investigators said they believe the shooter returned to base after the first attack and left later to kill  again.
Bales, who is being held in a U.S. military prison, has been charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder.
A spokesman for NATO and U.S. forces, Lt. Col. Jimmie Cummings, said  coalition members often make compensation payments, but they are usually kept private.

Blacks tap power of social media; 
Growing numbers find a voice on Twitter, Facebook

BYLINE: Melanie Eversley, USA TODAY

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 774 words

As a black man in America, Shaka Berry, 38,  says he has been stopped by police for no apparent reason. He says he is desensitized to news about the deaths of black men.
But when Berry, a telecommunications salesman who lives in Washington, D.C., learned details of the Trayvon Martin case, he said he was moved to tears. He was disturbed about news reports that Trayvon, 17, of Sanford, Fla., was fatally shot Feb. 26 while returning from a run to 7-Eleven for iced tea and Skittles.
Berry was disheartened that shooter George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer described as white by police, had not been arrested. So Berry expressed himself like many others on Facebook: He posted a photo of himself in a hooded sweatshirt -- what Trayvon was wearing when he died. 
The photo "was my little way to express outrage at what happened to the kid," Berry said.
Berry's visual statement is  part of a social media trend: Black Americans and, to a smaller extent, Hispanic Americans are using such media in larger numbers than Americans overall, experts say. Word of the Trayvon Martin case has gone viral  as social media users, including many black Americans, publicize rallies and  urge contacts to sign petitions.
Black and Hispanic Americans are more likely to use their cellphones as their sole way of connecting to the Internet, said Aaron Smith, senior research specialist with the Pew Internet & American Life Project. This tends to translate into wider social media use, Smith said.
Among cellphone users, 39% of black, non-Hispanic Americans and 35% of Hispanic Americans access social networking sites compared with 24% of white, non-Hispanic Americans, according to a 2011 Pew survey of 2,277 adults.
Younger black Americans grew up communicating by text and instant message, and social media interaction feels natural, said Michael Street, a New York-based social media strategist. This generation tends to communicate  by sharing photos and information as close to real time as possible, he said.
"Sites like BlackPlanet.com and MySpace helped to train and introduce this audience to social media," Street said. "Now that they have the knowledge, they have taken it and run with it."
Social media have evolved as an outlet for people who feel ignored, said Rashad Robinson, executive director of ColorOfChange.org, a  New York-based organization that plans events focused on issues involving black Americans.
"We're hearing stories of mothers telling   of   their fear for their children in the criminal justice system," Robinson said. "We're hearing from fathers telling us about 'the talk' that they have with their young sons or nephews" about carrying themselves passively so they can avoid trouble with police.
The trend is probably an extension of what black Americans have been doing for centuries -- communicating through word-of-mouth, said William Winters, senior campaigner for Change.org, where a petition related to the Trayvon Martin case has generated the most signatures of any petition on its site.
"I think part of it has to do with the oral storytelling traditions in black communities," Winters said. "What is new about it is the speed at which the sharing of information can happen."
Many seem to innately recognize the power of social media in reaching  black Americans.
Syndicated radio talk show host Michael Baisden, who is black,  urged his Facebook followers to post photos of themselves in hoodies.
Baisden, host of The Michael Baisden Show, told USA TODAY that he likes interacting via social media because "it's just me and them and so they're getting their information."
He and others credit social media with publicizing other cases with racial implications, including that of Troy Davis, the Georgia man executed Sept. 21 for a murder that supporters  believe he didn't commit, and the Jena Six, six black teens in Jena, La., convicted in December 2006 of beating a white student, though critics felt the punishment was harsh.
Marian Wright Edelman, founder  of the Washington-based Children's Defense Fund, sent a staffer out to buy a hoodie so she could post a photo of herself wearing one.
"Mrs. Edelman really felt that she wanted to stand with all the young people who were standing up for justice for Trayvon Martin," said spokeswoman Patti Hassler.
Former Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm, host of The War Room with Jennifer Granholm on Current TV, also posed for a hoodie photo. In an e-mail to USA TODAY, Granholm wrote, "The hoodie is a way of expressing support for the Martin family, and for all the sons of African-American families who bear the heavy burden of other people's negative assumptions."

France hands down charges for brother of gunman

BYLINE: The Associated Press

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 6A

LENGTH: 342 words

PARIS -- A Frenchman suspected of helping
his brother plot attacks against paratroopers
and Jewish schoolchildren was
handed preliminary murder and terrorism
charges Sunday.
Abdelkader Merah denied any role in the 
attacks. Investigators suspect Merah of
helping his brother Mohamed plan France's
worst terrorist attacks in years, and they are
investigating whether they were linked to
an international network of extremists or
worked on their own.
Abdelkader Merah's lawyer said her client
feels like "a scapegoat."
"No one knew anything" about what Mohamed
was plotting, lawyer Anne-Sophie
Laguens said in Paris. She dismissed reports
that Abdelkader had praised his brother's
attacks. "He was never proud of those actions,"
she said.
Mohamed Merah, 23, claimed responsibility
for killing three Jewish schoolchildren,
a rabbi and three paratroopers this month.
After a 32-hour standoff with police, he
died Thursday in a hail of gunfire in the
southern city of Toulouse.
Since then, attention has focused on his
older brother, Abdelkader, who was handed
preliminary charges on Sunday of complicity
to murder and theft and involvement in a
terrorist enterprise, prosecutors said. Detained
last week, he will remain in custody
pending further investigation.
Preliminary charges under French law
mean there is strong reason to believe a
crime was committed but allow magistrates
more time to investigate.
Authorities suspect Abdelkader Merah
had a role in acquiring his younger brother's
arsenal and financing his trips to Afghanistan,
Pakistan and the Middle East.
Mohamed Merah claimed allegiance to
al-Qaeda and told police he traveled to Afghanistan
and Pakistan for training.
Abdelkader was questioned several years
ago about alleged links to a network sending
Toulouse-area youths to Iraq, but no action
was brought against him at the time.
Prosecutor Franחois Molins said the inquiry
is also looking at anyone else who
could have been involved.
The brother's girlfriend, Yamina Mesbah,
was held and then released early Sunday
without being charged.
The Merah brothers' mother was released
Friday night.

Americans are outraged over Trayvon Martin's death

SECTION: EDIT; Pg. 8A

LENGTH: 534 words

Americans are  not "soul-searching" about the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, as a recent USA TODAY headline stated; we are outraged ("Trayvon Martin is dead; nation is soul-searching," Cover story, News, Wednesday)!
Maybe the Sanford, Fla., police are  soul-searching. Maybe George  Zimmerman, God help him, is soul-searching. 
Imagine that was your kid, walking home from the store, minding his own business when  some puffed-up, not-in-uniform, trigger-happy guy started following him in his car and then on foot, scared him, challenged him and shot him dead. Forever.
Ed Veeser
Austin
Zimmerman overstepped authority
This is not about a black kid being shot because he resisted or was in an area where he "didn't belong." This is about a citizen assuming he had the authority to enforce a law and to carry a weapon where neither  authority nor training  was present.
It is truly  tragic  when a teenager  cannot walk to a 7-Eleven,  buy a snack and walk home without being shot. It is not possible to know all the facts from news media reports, but, so far,  this story stinks.
Fred Stewart
Kalispell, Mont.
Keep weapons out of wrong hands
Let's talk about the 800-pound gorilla in the egregious case of Trayvon Martin and George Zimmerman. The Second Amendment allows the freedom to keep and bear arms. With rights, however, come responsibilities.
I've served close to 30  years in the fire and emergency service business. During that time, I've seen more than my share of shootings and cannot, for the life of me, remember anyone shooting  someone to protect life and/or property.
I do remember a friend's wife, an accomplished tournament handgun expert, accidentally  shooting herself  in the leg while investigating a bump in the night.
The fire department was  awakened one night to find three young people with holes in their heads as a result of some sort of dispute. I  remember eight shifts in a row that started or ended with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.
While the emotional effect of this tragedy weighs heavily on us all, I hope it will stimulate reasoned discussions on how we can keep idiots from getting weapons for which the sole purpose is to  shoot people for no apparent reason.
Michael P. Kane
Snellville, Ga.
Focus on sacredness of life
Your editorial  "In Trayvon's death, ugly echoes"  ends with questions to ponder (Friday). Some questions I have:  If Trayvon Martin had been white and shot to death, would this have been a national  or a local story? If George Zimmerman had been black and shot a white boy, would Al Sharpton  have held a rally for the boy?
No doubt  race played a factor in this incident, but I think the tragedy is we have made race the primary focus of this story. What I see is a young boy whose life has been taken away. An individual has been killed, never to achieve his God-given potential. My prayers go to his family.
I believe the primary focus of this tragic story should be Trayvon, a young person. That is what will give meaning to his life.  Let's make this about the sacredness of a human life.
When we shift our primary focus in such a way, we hopefully will begin to see each other as human beings.

Kellogg: 'Cats best but beatable

BYLINE: Michael Hiestand

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 3C

LENGTH: 746 words

Charles Barkley, after Kentucky blew out Baylor, speculated Sunday who could beat the Wildcats: "The (NBA) Toronto Raptors can. The Charlotte Bobcats maybe.  But nobody in college basketball can beat this team. Period."
Clark Kellogg, who will call the NCAA Final Four and called Kentucky's suspenseless win Sunday, disagrees. The Bobcats, Kellogg said in a phone interview Sunday, could "definitely" beat Kentucky -- "the pride factor would rise up if NBA teams played college teams."
Too bad we can't see that for ourselves. Instead, CBS/Turner is left with the prospect of having to showcase a team that suggests college basketball supremacy is simply a matter of recruiting pro prospects. Kellogg says Kentucky's success "reinforces the idea that recruiting is 75% of the equation" -- he figures Kentucky's starting lineup and sixth man Darius Miller are all possible future pros -- and he doesn't "think anybody is going to debate whether Kentucky is the best team. But I wouldn't be stunned if Kentucky lost now. It's one game, not a series." 
Brand names from big conferences in the Final Four -- including Ohio State, where Kellogg is on the school's board of trustees -- suggests CBS/Turner will end up with solid Final Four ratings. With competition from Tiger Woods on NBC's golf and the overall rate of households using their TVs being down a bit from last year -- how dare viewers opt for natural light? -- NCAA games Saturday averaged 5.6% of U.S. TV households, down 10% from last year's comparable coverage. So far, NCAA TV games overall are averaging 5.6%, down 5% from last year but (inevitably) up 8% from 2010, when CBS last had its old regionalized coverage.
Ratings reprieve? NBC's Johnny Miller, as  Woods on Sunday  earned his first PGA Tour victory  in 30 months, said it "wouldn't surprise me if he wins 35-40 times (in a) second career. He's going to kick butt. Watch out boys on the PGA Tour -- Tiger is back!" Golf broadcasters are now wiping away tears of joy. Consider that NBC's golf Saturday drew a 2.9 overnight, equivalent to 2.9% of households in the 56 urban TV markets measured for overnights -- up 53% from last year's (Woods-less) coverage. And look out now, Miller says: "Gotta hand it to him. When Tiger gets a hold of that flat stick, he doesn't leak oil too often."
ESPN reversal: News media organizations generally don't like their staffers seeming to take sides in public controversies. And off the growing publicity surrounding the shooting of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin and the wearing of hooded sweatshirts having become a public sign of protest, some ESPN staffers began showing themselves in hoodies in their Twitter photos. ESPN on Friday asked those staffers to stop it -- and not discuss the case on Twitter -- but reversed that policy Sunday. "It's a tragic situation that's led to much thoughtful discussions throughout the company," ESPN's Josh Krulewitz says. "As a result, in this circumstance, we have decided to allow this particular expression of human sympathy." And, he says, the policy applies only to social media: "We believe communicating through TV is very different from social media, which provides a personal interactive environment."
Spice rack: After  Woods thwacked his ball into somebody's backyard on the 15th hole of  PGA Tour action Saturday, NBC's blimp shots showed people gathered around the ball -- and taking pictures of themselves. At that point, savvy home viewers knew to take pictures of themselves in front of their TV screens.  As golfer Charlie Wi struggled Saturday, NBC's Miller said he'd better get his strokes straightened out or "he's going to go 'Wi, Wi, Wi' all the way home." Miller will also be playing the Dayton Chuckle Hut next month. No, not really.  NBC Sports Network's field-level microphones caught MLS' Houston Dynamo player Colin Clark yelping a slur and expletive at a Seattle Sounders ball boy, but NBCSN didn't address it on-air. That omission, NBC spokesman Adam Freifeld said, was because the game announcers and producers didn't hear Clark, "or we would have issued an apology on-air."  After NFL Network's Warren Sapp tweeted that ex-New Orleans Saint Jeremy Shockey  was the "snitch" in leaking the team's bounty system, NFL Network said in a statement that Sapp was "an analyst, not a reporter" -- which is sort of odd, since analysts at various networks pass on news tidbits -- who just needs "to understand the verification procedure that our reporters follow."

Celebrity addicts: Who dies and who survives?; 
Disease doesn't discriminate, yet some are lucky

BYLINE: Maria Puente, USA TODAY

SECTION: LIFE; Pg. 1D

LENGTH: 2285 words

Whitney Houston's death last month from accidental drowning and  the effects of cocaine use and heart disease throws a bright light on a dark corner of the world of celebrities who wrestle with substance abuse.
The toll of celebrity addiction -- to street drugs, prescription medications, alcohol or a mix -- is long and mournful, and it seems particularly heavy right now  because of the deaths of Houston, 48, and Amy Winehouse, 27.
And not just them: In recent years, Michael Jackson, Heath Ledger and Anna Nicole Smith have succumbed to overdoses; going back further, the list includes John Belushi, Marilyn Monroe, Elvis Presley and Judy Garland.
Americans these days can't escape the steady stream of news about celebrities and their controlled substances. Take Lindsay Lohan, 25.  After years of erratic behavior, multiple arrests and five stints in rehab, Lohan says she has  cleaned up her act. She promised to stay away from drugs and alcohol, and she  completed  her comeback gig as host of Saturday Night Live  March 3 (ratings were good but reviews were mixed). 
Recent weeks also brought news that  actor Gerard Butler (300), 42, and comedian Artie Lange, 44, both  completed rehab for addiction and are back working.  Yet actress Demi Moore, 49, who was hospitalized after smoking something that gave her convulsions, sought "professional assistance" for her problem. And actor Alex O'Loughlin, star of CBS' Hawaii Five-0, has announced that he would take time off  to get "supervised treatment" for pain medication prescribed after a  shoulder injury.
This sort of thing is not uncommon in Hollywood: Actress Tatum O'Neal, 48, who has long battled to overcome substance abuse, also is in "supervised treatment" to prevent a recurrence of addiction, to painkillers prescribed for back surgery. "She will always seek supervision when taking prescription medication that has addictive potential," according to a statement issued by her manager, Angela Cheng Caplan.
But it's fair to ask: Is there a fatal attraction between celebrities and controlled substances? Why do some survive and some die?
"It's that caustic mix of sudden celebrity and being strung out and it being condoned by the people around you," says Duff McKagan, 48, the original bass player for rock band Guns N' Roses and a longtime drug and alcohol addict who had to nearly die from an exploding pancreas in 1994 at age 30 before he was motivated to get help. His mother weeping in her wheelchair over her youngest child, and his eventual discovery of the physical and spiritual strengths of martial arts, also helped, he says.
A painful reminder
Houston's death brought up painful memories for daytime talk-show host Wendy Williams, who walked away from her secret cocaine addiction years ago because she wanted a better life.
"Whitney and I, same age, and both plagued with the demon of substance abuse," Williams said tearfully on her show shortly after Houston's death. "It's been almost 15 years since I smoked last from a crack pipe. It's been almost 15 years since I waited on Jerome Avenue in the Bronx for my drugs."
Williams, 47,  whose 3-year-old talk show has been renewed for two more years and is syndicated in more than 150 markets, started dabbling in drugs when she was in college,  and fame and success later did nothing to stop  her escalating habit. She looks back on those years with her signature mix of humor and self-awareness. A middle-class girl with middle-class values, she says she could not have survived the "TMZ era" of salacious attention on celebrity addiction.
"I never wanted to shame my family, so I just stopped," she says. "The unspoken disappointment of the people closest to me was tearing me apart. That girl who went through that, it made me the woman I am today, but I would have ended up dying. And if I hadn't died of dying, I would have died of embarrassment. I would have lost my job or been written up in the New York Post."
Addiction experts say  celebrities are not more prone to addictive behavior: Anyone can inherit that DNA.
"Addiction does not discriminate," says Kevin Hill, addictions psychiatrist in charge of drug abuse treatment at Harvard Medical School's McLean Hospital. "People use according to psychosocial stressers. Celebrities might have slightly different stressers, such as fame, but they use drugs like regular people -- they just use better drugs."
What actors, singers, athletes, even CEOs have that regular people might not have is more access to drugs, more time to indulge, more money to pay for the addiction, and often a horde of enabling hangers-on who are financially dependent on them and thus more motivated to supply substances for them.
It all adds up to a lifestyle that is hard to walk away from, McKagan says.
"Some can do (drugs) and move on and some do it and get stuck.  In the last year before ending up in the hospital, I had given up. I said, 'I can't stop this,'" says McKagan, author of the memoir, It's So Easy (And Other Lies). "I had to be scared to death."
Winehouse's death  in her London home last July probably was caused by  accidental alcohol poisoning, according to the coroner's report. Her  parents are setting up a foundation in her memory to help people overcome addiction.
Houston was found submerged in a Beverly Hills hotel bathtub last month with bottles of prescription pills  in her room. Her family said she was taking anti-anxiety drugs, and she was seen drinking the night before.
On CNN last month,  Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum said celebrities such as Houston are "the royalty of America" who set a bad example by their  drug use.
"Ridiculous," Hill says. "He implies that she chose to suffer such a fate, when in fact she made multiple efforts to treat it. To say that someone makes a conscious decision to have her life go down the drain is preposterous."
Yet one of Houston's close friends, R&B legend Chaka Khan, herself a recovering drug addict, said on CNN that her best memories of Houston involve getting high with her and Houston's ex-husband, Bobby Brown. "Talking crazy and having a really, really, really good laughing, and a really, really good time," she said.
With coverage of Houston's death and  Michael Jackson's drug overdose death in 2009, it's easy to forget that there are more survival stories than tragedies among celebrity addicts.
Rocker and American Idol judge Steven Tyler, 64, who came close to dying from drug abuse, appeared with the other members of Aerosmith on 60 Minutes , talking about the ravages of addiction on bodies, band and relationships. But after 40 years, and lots of rehab, they're still rocking, about to tour and about to record another album.
Actress Kirstie  Alley, 61, was "way into drugs" when she was Lohan's age, she recently told Access Hollywood. "If you don't die doing them, you just screw up your life sort of royally," she said.
Actor Robert Downey Jr., 46, may be Exhibit A for the  celebrity comeback from addiction. Not so long ago, he was being sentenced to jail for drug-related offenses; now he's out, he's recovering and he's a bigger star than ever with lead roles in the Iron Man and Sherlock Holmes movies.
Actress Mackenzie Phillips, 52, was once so drug-addled  that she spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on cocaine, lost jobs and lovers, used drugs while pregnant with her son, watched as close relatives died from drug abuse, and says she was even reduced to a years-long incestuous relationship with her equally addicted father,  musician John Phillips of The Mamas and the Papas.
She should be dead, she says, and she gives herself credit for battling back from the brink. True, most of her family cut her off because of what she says about her late father, but she feels she has finally escaped her past. "At last I'm living the health and happiness that I always described but never experienced," she wrote in her 2009 memoir, High on Arrival.
There's nothing new about celebrity addiction. Billie Holiday, the great jazz singer who died in 1959, may have been one of the first major celebrities to go to her grave too early (she was only 44) because of the effects of alcoholism and drug addiction.
Nor is there anything new about addiction among non-celebrity Americans. According to the government's Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 23.5 million people 12 or older needed treatment for a drug or alcohol problem in 2009, but only 2.6 million actually were treated at a specialty facility (aka rehab).
As for addiction deaths, those happen among ordinary people, too, but we  don't hear about them because they're not celebrities.
A new addiction
What is new is that increasingly Americans are getting hooked on prescription drugs, and ending up dead or close to it by accidentally taking too much or mixing them with alcohol. The number of overdose deaths from painkillers more than tripled from 1999 to 2006, to 13,800 deaths that year, according to Center for Disease Control statistics released in 2009.
Conservative  radio king Rush Limbaugh, 61, was pescribed powerful painkillers after back surgery. He ended up hooked in 2003, was  caught trying to acquire them illegally, was arrested and spent a month in rehab.
Prescription drug addiction has become "an epidemic,"  says psychiatrist Marc Galanter, director of alcoholism and substance abuse treatment at NYU Langone Medical Center/Bellevue.
"There's a whole new raft of (narcotic) drugs available that will compromise you, and you don't have to be a celebrity to afford them -- middle-class people can afford them," Galanter says.
Why do people who are rich, famous, beautiful and talented feel the need for drugs and alcohol? Life coach and family advocate Lisa Nkonoki, who says she helped Ray Charles Jr. overcome his addictions, has offered her services to her longtime friend,  Brown, father of Houston's teen daughter, Bobbi Kristina, who as the child of addicts is at risk of stumbling down the same path. Nkonoki says celebrities, like anyone else, can become addicts because they don't feel strong or good about themselves at some level.
"It's an escape (from) the persona people want them to be instead of the person they truly are," she says.  Stepping away from addiction, she says, comes only after accepting that it's a disease.
"When you get this disease, you have to deal with it, manage it, emerge from it and move on."
The key factor in treating addictions, celebrity or otherwise, is recognizing that there's usually an underlying mental-health problem, says Kathleen Bigsby, CEO of The Canyon at Peace Park, an  exclusive and ultra-private comprehensive treatment center in Malibu  that has treated celebrities (no names, she says) for addiction and "co-occurring disorders."
Actress/writer Carrie Fisher, 55, was addicted to drugs and drink (and food) almost from the time she became a star  playing Princess Leia in Star Wars. Was it fame that made her a mess? Probably not, because she's also bipolar and her  childhood as a Hollywood princess (daughter of Debbie Reynolds and singer Eddie Fisher) left her plagued by insecurity and despair, she says. Fame didn't help.
Fisher turned her difficulties into successful comic memoirs and stage shows, writing in her latest book, Shockaholic, that she tried everything to cure herself over the decades -- therapy and retreats, overeating and fasting, 12-steps, meditation, rebirthing, walking over hot coals, jumping out of airplanes, climbing  mountains, floating down the Amazon, speaking in tongues  you get the picture.
And yet, "I still did not feel -- how shall I put this -- mentally sound," she writes.
The problem for celeb addicts is they have to struggle and recover in public, in the glare of social media and the 24/7 celebrity-media industrial complex, Bigsby says. Nowadays even D-list celebrities are in the spotlight.
Meanwhile, tragic deaths can teach grim lessons, but   sometimes not, addiction expert Galanter says.
"It alerts people to the danger, but can also make it attractive, because if a celeb is doing it, people think maybe they can risk it, too," he says.
"Deaths might sober people up, but it depends on how sensible people are. I hope so."

Ashton Kutcher and Co. set to get 'Punk'd' again; 
After a five-year absence, MTV's prank show returns with revolving guest hosts

BYLINE: Bill Keveney, USA TODAY

SECTION: LIFE; Pg. 1D

LENGTH: 1029 words

Ashton Kutcher sits for a photo. Justin Bieber stands behind him, raising two fingers behind Kutcher's head.
"What are you doing? I feel you're doing something behind my back," Kutcher says. "Are you giving me rabbit ears and I'm not knowing it?"
Yes, he is, and it's more than fitting. Bieber will be the first guest host of MTV's new edition of Punk'd (Thursday, 10 ET/PT), a show co-created by Kutcher that added a new pop-culture term for the word prank.
This Punk'd, back after a five-year break, will feature a different celebrity guest host each week in the manner of Saturday Night Live. Hosts, who will bring in their own celebrity friends as marks, include Bam Margera, Hayden Panettiere, Kellan Lutz, Nick Cannon and Heather Morris. Zac Efron, Vanessa Hudgens, Josh Hutcherson, Emma Roberts and Nicole "Snooki" Polizzi are among those getting punked. 
"There's a whole new crop of talented stars, celebrities, entertainers and athletes that weren't even around when we were shooting the show," Kutcher says during a roundtable sitdown with Bieber and fellow Punk'd co-creator and executive producer Jason Goldberg at a recording studio.
The young talent adds a new dynamic and gives the show a varied feel from host to host, Goldberg says. "It's fresh thinking. It's a different way to approach the show.  Justin's show is so different from Bam's show, but both work. It's their thinking and their vision for it."
'An irresistible stew'
Punk'd, part of a hidden-camera tradition that goes back more than a half-century to Candid Camera, came along during an early wave of reality TV, combining pranks with the public interest in celebrity, says Ron Simon, television and radio curator at the Paley Center for Media.
"Practical jokes, cameras and celebrities -- it's an irresistible stew for many Americans," he says. "The whole idea of celebrities punking each other was very appealing."
Combining the show's cultural cachet with young stars who match up well with MTV's teen and twentysomething target audience, plus a few alterations, made it a good candidate to bring back, network programming chief David Janollari says.
"We have a history of reinventing (for) our audience, which is ever-changing," he says.  "I don't think we've seen a time where this young core audience is more fascinated and more engaged with celebrity. The timing feels perfect."
Kutcher, who used to host, is too busy these days with other projects, including  stepping into CBS' Two and a Half Men after Charlie Sheen's departure. Kutcher wouldn't commit on whether he's coming back for a second season, but he says he hopes so.
"I'm having a blast making the show. I'm really grateful because I think people have embraced the new version of the show and my character. I just hope we can continue to entertain people."
Another hosting hitch: He was so associated with the show that it became difficult to entrap unwitting victims with elaborate pranks, or "punks." "You can only get so many calls from Ashton Kutcher and you're like, 'I'm not showing up.' After a while, I couldn't call anyone."
Kutcher developed his taste for pranks when he was growing up in Iowa. "Being from the Midwest, we don't really have sarcasm there. People are just earnest," he says. "I remember when I first moved to New York, I thought everybody was angry with me or mad because they were being sarcastic all the time. Our version of sarcasm was pulling pranks."
Bieber the prankster
Bieber, 18,  has a healthy interest in Kutcher's art form, growing up a fan of Punk'd and enjoying pulling pranks. "April Fool's Day is my favorite holiday," he says.
The singer, whose single Boyfriend is out today, was able to lure star friends Taylor Swift, Miley Cyrus, Sean Kingston and Rob Dyrdek for the first episode. The elaborate punking of Swift involved a boat, fireworks and fire. "She's such a sweet girl, so we wanted to go huge on her and make it so she would be really scared," Bieber says.
Goldberg says the singer was the right choice to kick off the new series.
"We knew (Bieber) was perfect,  because his first five ideas the lawyers said, 'Absolutely not. No way.' That's when we knew we got the guy."
Bieber, who says he had a blast, found the experience  intense.  "I'll go and perform for thousands of people, and I don't get nervous. Then, the day I'm punking somebody, I'll get so nervous. I'll feel like this needs to happen. I really want it to work."
Kutcher understands the sentiment, saying he's far  more nervous in the Punk'd "pilot's seat" than before a Men taping. "There's so much nervous energy because you only get one take. There's no do-over. You either pull it off or you don't."
Besides guest hosts, Punk'd has other new twists. It will show behind-the-scenes planning and setup, Goldberg says. "You're actually seeing how we're thinking and why and how this is going to have to get done. We didn't do that before."
Social media glitches
Kutcher says the punking is done in good spirit and isn't meant to make anyone look bad. And if the celebrity doesn't like it, which has happened, the segment doesn't run.
"When it happens, it's our job to respect them. I appreciate the right to privacy as a famous person, so I would never want to infringe on that right," he says. (Kutcher, whose relationship and split with  Demi Moore has attracted a lot of attention, declined to answer questions about his personal life.)
With social media having exploded since the first Punk'd,  it's tougher to maintain secrecy, even for the few hours needed to get the mark in place.
"My actions, where I am or what I'm doing, is on the Internet within three hours of anything I do," Kutcher says. "When you go to set up a bit -- you need to be there three hours before to make sure everything is done -- the (target) could know something is going on before he ever even showed up."
But social media, as expert Bieber knows, also has fueled interest in the new version, including that of young celebrities for whom being punked means they have arrived.
"I think it's a validator," Kutcher says. "You're zeitgeist-y if you got punked. You're in the public domain. You're someone that people care to watch a prank be pulled on."

Watchman, police need to answer for their actions

BYLINE: DeWayne Wickham

SECTION: EDIT; Pg. 7A

LENGTH: 602 words

The most revealing thing about the investigation into the killing of Trayvon Martin is a blank page on the police department's website. The heading atop it says simply, "Sanford's Most Wanted."
The empty space beneath those words is a metaphor for the botched response to the killing of the black 17-year-old, whose assailant the police refuse to arrest. That's because George Zimmerman, a  neighborhood watch volunteer whose father is white and mother is Hispanic, claims he was acting in self-defense when he killed Martin with a single shot to the chest. Zimmerman, to keep from being tried, is relying on Florida's controversial "Stand Your Ground" law, which allows a person to use deadly force when  he feels threatened. But Zimmerman didn't stand his ground; he pursued his prey.
Failed to wait for police 
Suspicious of Martin as the teenager walked inside the gated community he was patrolling on Feb. 26, Zimmerman followed him in his SUV. He called 911 to say Martin, who was walking in the rain to the home of his father's fiance,  looked as if he was up to no good because he had pulled the hood of his sweatshirt over his head. The 911 operator told Zimmerman to stop following Martin and await the arrival of police. Zimmerman ignored that order.
At some point, he got out of his SUV and shot Martin. Zimmerman claims he used deadly force only after being attacked by the teen. Phone records show Martin was talking to his girlfriend seconds before he was shot. The unnamed 16-year-old says Martin told her someone was following him. Then she heard a man demand to know what Martin was doing in that neighborhood before the cellphone  went dead.
The police investigation  looks like the work of Keystone Kops at best. At worst, it smacks of something much more disturbing. Martin's body wasn't identified until the next day when police, responding to his father's missing person report, showed him a picture of the young man's body.
Despite this, the corpse remained in the morgue three days, classified only as "John Doe."
It took that long for the cops to send the medical examiner the required paperwork that officially identified the remains and authorized the family to retrieve it for burial, Benjamin Crump, the Martin family's attorney, told me.
Gunman not tested for drugs
Martin's  body was tested for drugs and alcohol. Neither was found. Zimmerman, the guy who killed him, was not tested. Zimmerman's blood-stained clothes weren't taken for analysis; the contents of his SUV weren't checked, Crump said. Zimmerman was set free after a brief police interrogation. Even after  police chief Bill Lee "temporarily" resigned amid growing  protests over his department's handling of this case, cops cling to the position that evidence -- what little they bothered to collect -- supports Zimmerman's self-defense claim.
That assertion  should be tested by the special prosecutor  appointed by Florida Gov. Rick Scott to take over the investigation. Martin was armed only with his cellphone, a can of iced tea and bag of Skittles candy when he encountered the gun-toting Zimmerman.
This mismatch, and the racial slur Zimmerman appears to utter on the 911 tape shortly before he leaves his vehicle for his deadly confrontation with Martin, should force him to have to account for his actions in a court of law. "It was wrong that Zimmerman profiled Trayvon. But it was tragic that the police did it, too," Crump said.
He's right. Justice won't be served until  Zimmerman and the Sanford police are made to answer for their actions in the case of Trayvon Martin.

Law is effective, misunderstood; 
OPPOSING VIEW

BYLINE: Bradford Cohen

SECTION: EDIT; Pg. 6A

LENGTH: 374 words

The "stand your ground" defense, established in 2005 by the Florida Legislature, works and is effective if applied properly. The law essentially provides that a person may use deadly force in self-defense when there's reasonable belief of a deadly threat, and without an obligation to retreat first. 
Although it wasn't codified as a law until 2005 in Florida, as early as 1921 the U.S. Supreme Court  established that a man or woman has no duty to retreat where there is an imminent fear of death or bodily harm. Justice Oliver Wendell Homes Jr. wrote that  "detached reflection cannot be demanded in the presence of an uplifted knife."
Some  individuals argue  that the "stand your ground" defense has opened the door to a free-for-all shooting gallery. This is simply not true. Although the number of justifiable homicides in Florida has more than doubled since "stand your ground" was passed in 2005, the rate of violent crime in the state deceased by  23% from 2005 to 2010, according to FBI statistics. This is not to say that the "stand your ground" law in itself caused the decrease,  but it certainly was a factor.
The main issue is not the law itself, but the way it is applied. The law is designed to protect  innocent victims. It does not have any provision to protect  original aggressors.
Since the Trayvon Martin shooting put "stand your ground" in the spotlight, the  general public has misunderstood the law, believing that someone can be chased down and killed without repercussions.  The specific facts and evidence that led police to apply the doctrine in the Martin case are unknown right now. The solution is better training for the police and  more transparent investigations so the public can understand why and when the doctrine is applied.
We as citizens do not know everything the police use to come to the conclusion that a case involved self-defense. As such, we are led by the mainstream news media, which might not have a full understanding of the law and the specific evidence in every case. Education is key; a lynch mob mentality will not solve  misconceptions about the law.

'Stand your ground' laws represent a recipe for tragedy; 
OUR VIEW

SECTION: EDIT; Pg. 6A

LENGTH: 608 words

One month has passed since George Zimmerman shot and killed unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Fla. So why hasn't Zimmerman, the overly zealous neighborhood watch patrolman, been charged with anything? Racial considerations aside, the answer is "stand your ground" -- a controversial Florida self-defense law that Sanford police  say prohibited them from making an arrest.
Enacted in 2005 at the behest of the  National Rifle Association,  "stand your ground"  gives citizens a right to use deadly force as long as they reasonably believe they're facing a threat of death or bodily harm. About two dozen states have followed suit. 
At first blush, the  idea of standing up to threats has a simple appeal that the gun lobby has been able to exploit. Dig a little deeper, though, and the concept is a recipe for tragedy, particularly in places like Florida where it's easy for people to get permits to carry concealed weapons.
Fact is, the new law was unnecessary. People have always had a right to self defense, particularly in their own homes or vehicles.  Sponsors in the Florida Legislature relied on a vague anecdote about an  elderly man who, after the series of hurricanes in 2004, shot an intruder in his trailer. The man was never charged,  but he had to wait months before prosecutors made the decision. That's an awfully thin reed for a drastic change in criminal laws.
At the time, police and prosecutors warned against the change, and it appears that their fears are being realized.  Since 2005, the number of cases classified as justifiable homicides in Florida has more than doubled.  "Stand your ground" has been invoked in numerous killings where unarmed people have been shot or stabbed in dubious circumstances.
In public places, such as bars and restaurants or parks and neighborhoods,  people once had a "duty to retreat" from danger. That legal principle, despite its unfortunate name, doesn't mean you have to turn  your back on an armed assailant. It means you can't reflexively use deadly force with little concern about the consequences. Instead, police and prosecutors  weigh the circumstances to determine  whether  the fear of bodily harm was, in fact, reasonable and whether the force used was appropriate.
You couldn't just pull out a gun and shoot someone who took a swing at you unless other evidence pointed to more extreme danger.
Often, these are close calls. But Florida authorities say their hands now are too often tied by "stand your ground".  Sanford's police chief said the law prohibited him from arresting Zimmerman. This despite the fact that Zimmerman had killed an unarmed teen and ignored a 911 operator's instruction not to intervene.
He might well have misinterpreted the law, but that only points to risk the law introduces: People will feel free to fire their weapons, and law enforcement will feel its hands are tied.
Amid the uproar over the Martin case, Florida ought to keep careful track of instances where "stand your ground" is invoked so that law enforcement, legislators and the public can see how the law is, or isn't, working. At the very least, police and prosecutors should be given more discretion to determine whether a person acted on reasonable or unreasonable fears. Better yet, Florida and other states that rushed to adopt "stand your ground" should go back  to the self-defense laws that served them well for decades.
Take a place with lots of guns, mix in a law that sends the message you can shoot first and claim self-defense later, and the result is as deadly as it is predictable. If that wasn't apparent before the Feb. 26 killing of an unarmed 17-year-old, it should be today.

Radio host questions Heat's hoodie tribute

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 3C

LENGTH: 441 words

Sirius XM radio host Dan Graca blasted the Miami Heat for posing in hoodies as a tribute to Trayvon Martin.
The 17-year-old was shot and killed by a neighborhood watch volunteer Feb. 26 in Sanford, Fla. 
Graca figures the Heat were trying to send a message but said, "I don't know what message it is."
Actually, Graca says the message the Heat were sending is that the team is "doing this for their own publicity  look at me. I'm a celebrity, and I need some attention."
Graca says the team should have been supporting the family but instead made it a "black-white issue."
While blaming the neighborhood watch volunteer for the violence, Graca did say, "If Trayvon Martin that night was not wearing a hoodie, I bet you dollars to doughnuts he's still alive today."

Fantasy Q&A
USA TODAY fantasy baseball expert Steve Gardner took reader questions in his first online chat of the season:
Q: Can you give us your best guess on how the Los Angeles Angels' outfield and DH playing time will shake out?
A:  It is just a guess at this point. Vernon Wells, Peter Bourjos and Torii Hunter are pretty much locked in as the starters.
Kendrys Morales likely will get the majority of the time at DH once we get to May, but in the meantime look for Bobby Abreu to get a chance to show his worth (possible trade?) early in the season. Mark Trumbo might get a couple of starts a week between DH (vs. a lefty) and third base. You will not see him in the outfield, in my opinion.
Mike Trout starts in the minors and waits until someone gets hurt.
Q: Are Francisco Liriano's and Brian Matusz's springs legit or fool's gold?
A: Both have a history of being pretty darn good, especially Minnesota Twins lefty Liriano, so it's not a stretch to think they could keep it up.
With Liriano, though, there always is going to be that injury risk. So he could be great for two months and useless the rest of the year.
The Baltimore Orioles' Matusz is a different case. He  lost it last year and somehow managed to start putting things back together this spring. It reminds me of another highly touted young pitcher who put up a 10.00 ERA when he first came up -- Roy Halladay. He figured things out and became pretty good eventually.
I'm not saying Matusz is going to be Roy Halladay, but there's a decent chance he's going to be much better than he was last year. Buy low now.
Q: Do you think Adrian Beltre is close to Evan Longoria in production this year?
A: I think they'll be very close. It all comes down to personal preference. They clearly are the top two third basemen in the American League.

Anger mounts against Fla. shooter; 
Protests demand arrest; legal experts decry rush to judgment

The man who shot and killed an unarmed black teen in a gated Florida community remains in hiding and in fear for his life, his attorney and friends said, as almost two dozen protests were held nationwide calling for his arrest.
Anger against neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman mounted Monday, a month after he shot Trayvon Martin, 17, in what he told police was an act of self-defense. The New Black Panthers, a militant group, set a bounty of $10,000 for Zimmerman's arrest, and a line of elected and civil rights leaders called Trayvon a "martyr" and his death an "assassination." 
Twenty rallies were held Monday in cities from Baltimore to San Diego.
"He is one of the most reviled people in America at this moment, but we don't know enough about the case," says Frank Farley, a Temple University psychologist who studies extreme behavior. "Maybe he's a horrendous racist and murderer. Maybe not. This case has given a whole new meaning to guilty until proven innocent."
Farley and other legal experts decry what they call a rush to judgment in a case where not all the facts have been released. Zimmerman has not been charged with any crime.
In several television interviews Monday, Zimmerman's attorney, Craig Sonner, and his friend Joe Oliver, who is black, defended the 28-year-old man. They said he is not a racist. Police say Zimmerman is white; his father says he is Hispanic. Hispanics can be of any race.
Oliver said on ABC News' Good Morning America that Zimmerman has "virtually lost his life now." Oliver told NBC News' Today that Zimmerman cried for days after the shooting.
Trayvon's family said Monday that their son had recently been suspended from school for possessing traces of marijuana in his book bag. Authorities confirmed to the Associated Press that Trayvon did not have a juvenile offender record.
Details of the deadly night are trickling out. The Orlando Sentinel, citing unnamed police sources, reported Monday that Zimmerman says Trayvon punched him, climbed on top of him and slammed his head repeatedly into the sidewalk, leaving Zimmerman bloody and battered.
A Sanford, Fla., police statement said the newspaper story was "consistent" with evidence turned over to prosecutors. A police report says Zimmerman's back was wet as if he had been on the ground and he had a bloody nose. The report says Zimmerman said, "I was yelling for someone to help me, but no one would help me."
Trayvon's family and attorney say Zimmerman was suspicious of the teen, who was on his way home from the store, because he was black. They say Zimmerman was the aggressor in the fight that led to Trayvon's death.
Little is known about Zimmerman, whose life has been turned upside-down since the shooting. He has moved out of his home. Police have been in touch with him but have not provided him with  security, Sanford City Manager Norton Bonaparte said. Seminole State College, where Zimmerman had been taking classes, said they were withdrawing him from enrollment out of concern for his and others' safety.
Orlando attorney Jose Baez, who  represented Casey Anthony, the young mother acquitted of killing her toddler  in one of last  year's most sensational trials, said it was appropriate for Zimmerman to avoid  the spotlight.
"What he is doing right now is the right thing to do, mainly for his safety and for his case," Baez said.
More than 500 people crowded into the Sanford City Commission meeting Monday, prompting it to be moved from City Hall to the civic center, where Trayvon's father urged Zimmerman's arrest.
The city earlier in the day named Capt. Darren Scott, a 23-year veteran of the police force and an African American, as acting chief, following the decision by Police Chief Bill Lee, who is white, to step down temporarily in the face of criticism of the department's handling of the case.
Kimra Major-Morris, attorney for Trayvon's mother, said she had filed trademark applications for two slogans containing his name: "Justice for Trayvon" and "I am Trayvon." She denied any profit motive and said the move was intended to preserve the rights for "projects that will assist other families who experience similar tragedies."

Prosecutors shouldn't have to be told to follow the law

SECTION: EDIT; Pg. 6A

LENGTH: 414 words

Page 2A of USA TODAY's March 16 issue was saddening and maddening. One article was about a man who had been wrongly jailed because his prosecutors had concealed evidence ("Fla. man wrongly jailed to be paid," News).  The other was about prosecutor misconduct in the case of  then-Alaska Sen. Ted Stevens ("Evidence hidden in Sen. Stevens' corruption case," News). 
I found particularly upsetting the statement that the  lawyers accused of misconduct could not be charged with criminal contempt because the judge did not tell them to follow the law.
What about the rest of us? Could I get away with punching a lawyer in the nose and threatening him with a gun  because I was not told clearly and unequivocally it was wrong?

Harsh punishment for misconduct
USA TODAY's  investigation of prosecutorial misconduct was right on the money as demonstrated by  March 16 news reports.
This kind of misconduct occurs regularly all over the country and is a truly black mark on the finest judicial system in the world. Unfortunately, although prosecutors can cause innocent people to be falsely imprisoned for many years, they are virtually never prosecuted.
Their violation of ethical, procedural and legal requirements will never stop until such conduct exposes them to imprisonment as well. Let them taste the fear of a ruined career and loss of freedom, and their support of perjured testimony and suppression of exculpatory evidence will come to an abrupt halt.

Speak out against abuse
USA TODAY's article "Imprisoned for crimes they might commit"  correctly illustrates difficulties the legal system has in managing dangerous sexual predators who have completed their prison terms (Cover story, News, March 19).
But another serious problem lurks among us: pedophiles who are not GPS monitored or under surveillance.
Molesters escape detection because they are trusted people who are skilled at hiding their actions. But far too often, someone knows or suspects abuse has occurred and does nothing. Using shame, embarrassment or fear of retribution as an excuse, a witness fails to follow through on reporting incidents. This is an aspect of the problem over which we all have some control.
Everyone must realize there is no shame in being a victim, but to let silence allow suspected pedophiles to continue abusing children is inexcusable.

Orlando attorney Jose Baez understands what Zimmerman is facing. Last summer, he represented Casey Anthony, the young mother acquitted of killing her toddler, Caylee, in one of the year's most sensational trials. Anthony has moved out of the Orlando area and away from the spotlight.
"Looking at Mr. Zimmerman, I think what he is doing right now is the right thing to do, mainly for his safety and for his case," Baez said.
Baez would not speak directly about Anthony, but he said Zimmerman will probably be forever scarred.
"He'll never have the life he had before, and that's something he needs to accept right away," Baez said. "He's dealing with severe psychological trauma."
Zimmerman is most likely facing financial and emotional stress, said Richard Rosenbaum, a Florida criminal defense attorney who has defended high-profile clients such as Lionel Tate and Jose Conseco.
In high-profile cases, attorneys advise clients to keep away from the media and avoid any comments -- public or private -- about the incident.
Defendants are also often advised to turn off their mobile phones, disconnect any land lines, leave their home and go into hiding.

Santorum says he was right to curse reporter

BYLINE: By Catalina Camia

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 2A

LENGTH: 370 words

Rick Santorum said Monday that he cursed at a reporter because he felt he was being harassed about his comment that Mitt Romney is the "worst Republican" to oppose President Obama. 
During a campaign event Sunday in Wisconsin, Santorum said, "Pick any other Republican in the country, but he (Romney) is the worst Republican in the country to put up against Barack Obama."
After the speech, a New York Times reporter referred to the remark: "You said that Mitt Romney is the worst Republican in the country. Is that true?" Santorum became agitated, and said he was referring to Romney's position on health care. "Quit distorting my words.  It's bulls---," Santorum said. The exchange was captured on video.
On Monday, Santorum stood by his comments, saying in several interviews that reporters were intentionally taking his remarks out of context. "If you haven't cursed out a New York Times reporter during the course of a campaign, you're not really a real Republican," Santorum said.
Romney shrugged off the incident, saying on CNN, "I'm not going to worry too much about what Rick is saying these days."
Cain video targets tax code -- and bunny
Former presidential candidate Herman Cain, a Republican, released a provocative new video Monday criticizing President Obama's economic policies with an image of a rabbit being shot.
In a message accompanying the video on YouTube, Cain says the rabbit was unharmed, "but our current tax code is killing small business."
It is the latest in a series of videos by Cain Connections, part of the businessman's "Solutions Revolution" and "We the People Movement." A previous video featured a little girl apparently killing a goldfish; the fish was meant to symbolize Obama's economic stimulus program snuffing out the economy.
The new video features the same little girl, this time loading a rabbit into a device that catapults the bunny into the air while a man fires at it with a shotgun. "This is small business under the current tax code," the girl says.
Cain, former CEO of Godfather's Pizza, vowed he would continue to speak out on issues after he abandoned his presidential bid in December. Cain Solutions has launched a Sick of Stimulus website, and posted several videos there.

Judge drops charges in Hutaree militia case; 
Rules government lacked evidence

A federal judge Tuesday knocked out federal conspiracy charges against seven members of the Hutaree militia group that prosecutors described as rural extremists plotting a violent revolt that included killing a police officer and bombing a funeral. 
U.S. District Judge Victoria Roberts granted defense requests for acquittal on all charges against five of the defendants and the most serious charges against two others: alleged ringleader David Stone Sr. and his son Joshua Stone.
Acting after prosecutors rested their case, Roberts ruled the government didn't have enough evidence to back its claims. The defendants could have faced up to life in prison if convicted of the charges, which included conspiring to commit sedition and conspiring to use weapons of mass destruction.
The trial  will resume Thursday on gun charges against David and Joshua Stone, who have been in custody without bond for two years, since a raid by federal agents.
"There was no case. There was no conspiracy," said Michael Rataj, a lawyer for Tina Stone, 46, of Adrian, Mich., one of those acquitted.
The others acquitted of all charges were David Stone Jr., 22, of Adrian; Michael Meeks, 42, of Manchester, Mich.; Thomas Piatek, 48, of Whiting, Ind.; and Kristopher Sickles, 29, of Sandusky, Ohio.
In a 28-page decision, Roberts wrote, "The evidence is not sufficient  to find that defendants came to a concrete agreement to forcibly oppose the authority of the government of the United States as charged in the indictment."
Prosecutors said Hutaree members were anti-government rebels prepared for a violent strike against federal law enforcement. There was never an attack, and defense lawyers said the government used members' offensive remarks about police to build a criminal case.
The FBI had planted an informant and an agent inside the Hutaree militia starting in 2008, and the audio and video evidence the agency collected became the cornerstone of the government's case.
"The court is aware that protected speech and mere words can be sufficient to show a conspiracy. In this case, however, they do not rise to that level," the judge said. She said David Stone Sr.'s "diatribes evince nothing more than his own hatred for -- perhaps even desire to fight or kill -- law enforcement; this is not the same as seditious conspiracy."
Gina Balaya, spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office, declined to comment.
In court documents filed last week, prosecutors said they had proof that a violent plan was in the works and that the government stopped it before it took effect.
"That there was no specific date, place, or target for this conflict -- or that it was not certain whether the Hutaree intended to initiate the conflict or simply to engage in it   is of no moment," Assistant U.S. Attorneys Sheldon Light and Christopher Graveline wrote.

Mike Lupica, (New York) Daily
News: "There is so much to know
about what happened between 
George Zimmerman and Trayvon
Martin, what was said, what really
happened after Zimmerman's
911call. What we will never know
is Martin's version of things from
the night when he never made it to the home of
his father's fiancיe. The fact that the victim was
an African-American male in a hoodie now drives
an increasingly outraged conversation out into
the streets. But the unchanging fact of this, now
and forever, is that Trayvon Martin, 17, is dead
because the other guy had the gun."
J.T. Young, The American Spectator: "Going into
a given election, the absolute number of votes
needed to win is unknown. What the parties do
'know' is that of all the potential voters out there,
their base comprises those on whom they can
most depend. The closer the election, the more
the contest becomes about who wins the most of
these. It is a political curiosity, therefore, that the
closer the election, and the more its outcome
appears to be dependent on the center, the more
the two political parties are driven from the
center. . . . For those imagining that America's
tight political balance is pushing it toward compromise,
it is actually serving to pull it further
apart."

House panel seeks regulations, reviews in teen's killing

Congress should investigate gun laws, the lack of regulations on local neighborhood watch groups and the social status of black men and boys, a group of House Democrats said Tuesday at a forum spurred by the shooting last month of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Florida. 
Trayvon Martin's parents were at the Capitol Hill panel, which also debated racial profiling, hate crimes and "Stand Your Ground" self-defense laws.
"The debate over the terrible tragedy of Trayvon Martin has captured the sympathy and the attention of the entire nation," said Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, who convened the panel.
Trayvon's parents, Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton,  thanked lawmakers for the national focus on their son's death. The family's attorney, Benjamin Crump, accompanied them.
"He's sadly missed, and we'll continue to fight for justice for him," Tracy Martin said of his son.
The case underscored the lack of clear standards on  how to investigate incidents involving claims of self-defense, said Rep. Corrine Brown, a Florida Democrat who represents Sanford, the city where the shooting occurred. Brown lauded the Justice Department investigation now underway and said of the controversy, "I don't know whether it's incompetent, it's a coverup or if it's all of the above."
George Zimmerman, 28, the  neighborhood watch volunteer who shot Trayvon,  has not been charged with a crime. That did not sit well with Rep. Frederica Wilson, D-Fla.
"Trayvon Martin was murdered in Sanford, Fla.," Wilson said. "No arrests have been made, and, in my opinion, an arrest should be made, and I will not rest until an arrest is made."
Wilson said she will introduce legislation to establish a federal commission to study the social status of African-American men and boys. "I am tired of burying young black boys. I have buried too many. Cried too many tears. Attended too many funerals and it is unnecessary," Wilson said.
Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, said she was working on a bill that would require mandatory registration for neighborhood watch programs.
The federal government needs to review "Stand Your Ground" laws enacted in Florida and elsewhere that allow a person to use deadly force without an obligation to retreat if they believe their life is threatened, Jackson Lee said. She suggested the problem lies with the law itself and not the police department.
Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, said the case highlights the role the nation's gun lobby has played in enacting "Stand Your Ground" laws, and he questioned Florida's system.

Students will need photos to take tests

LENGTH: 635 words

The millions of students who take the SAT or ACT each year will have to submit photos of themselves when they sign up for the college entrance exams, under security measures announced Tuesday in the aftermath of a cheating scandal on Long Island, N.Y.
The two companies that administer the tests, the College Board and ACT, agreed to the precautions under public pressure brought to bear by Nassau County District Attorney Kathleen Rice, who is overseeing the investigation. The measures will take effect in the fall. The changes will "give high schools and colleges the tools they need to identify those who try to cheat," Rice said. 
Rice has charged 20 current or former students from a cluster of wealthy Long Island suburbs with participating in a scheme in which teenagers hired other people for as much as $3,500 each to take the exam for them.
Abortion provider records found in bin
A Kansas prosecutor said he doesn't expect to file criminal charges against a former abortion provider who discarded patient medical records in a recycling bin outside an elementary school.
Johnson County District Attorney Steve Howe said his office will examine whether Krishna Rajanna violated state consumer protection laws, which are enforced through civil lawsuits. Howe said he may contact federal officials about potential violations of patient privacy laws.
Rajanna confirmed that he discarded hundreds of patient records in a recycling bin outside an elementary school near his home in Overland Park, believing the bin would be emptied quickly.
San Francisco sheriff fights suspension
San Francisco Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi filed a court challenge to his suspension stemming from a domestic violence case.
Mirkarimi's lawyers argued that he can't be suspended over the incident  because it happened before Mirkarimi took office. Mirkarimi, 50, pleaded guilty this month to misdemeanor false imprisonment for a New Year's Eve dispute during which his wife's arm was bruised. More serious domestic violence charges were dropped in a plea deal with prosecutors.
Calif. nuclear plant to remain off-line
California's San Onofre nuclear plant will stay shut down until investigators make sure there is no safety risk, Nuclear Regulatory Commission regional Administrator Elmo  Collins said.
The announcement came as environmental group Friends of the Earth released a report accusing the plant operator of misleading the NRC about equipment and design changes that could have caused extensive wear on tubing that carries radioactive water in the Unit 3 reactor. Jennifer Manfre, a spokeswoman for operator Southern California Edison, said the company has provided "open and transparent information." The NRC said it knew about the design changes.
New face, new hope for Virginia man
After 15 years of wearing a mask and living as a recluse, a Virginia man disfigured in a gun accident got a new face, nose, teeth and jaw in what University of Maryland physicians said is the most extensive face transplant ever performed.
Richard Norris, 37, is recovering well after last week's surgery, beginning to feel his face,  brushing his teeth and shaving, said Eduardo Rodriguez, surgeon at University of Maryland Medical Center. He showed a 1993 photo of Norris, "as we all want to be remembered," and a pre-transplant photo of the battered face with a sunken mouth and flattened nose.
In a photo taken Monday, his face appears ordinary, other than stitches along his hairline and neck and scarring near his eyelids.

7 years before Trayvon's death; 
Fatal shooting of teenager in Florida parallells that of another in 2005

BYLINE: Jeff Perlman

SECTION: EDIT; Pg. 9A

LENGTH: 729 words

The tragic death of Trayvon Martin on Feb. 26 has sparked a national conversation and deep soul searching on an age-old subject: race.
But for me, Trayvon Martin's death parallels a similar tragedy that unfolded in my community on Feb. 26, 2005 -- exactly seven years before.
Jerrod Miller was a 16-year-old African American  who was shot and killed by a white rookie police officer outside a school dance in Delray Beach, Florida. 
The tragic shooting triggered protests, anger, sadness and a complex legal process that included a civil suit and the first inquest in Palm Beach County in decades.
I was mayor of Delray Beach at the time,  and there is no playbook for how to manage or cope with a situation as sad, tragic and volatile as the shooting of a teen.
And while the Jerrod Miller shooting was the subject of intense local news media coverage, it did not become a national story, probably because social media was not as influential in 2005 as it is today.
Nevertheless, there are similarities to explore and lessons to be learned from our experience in Delray and what is unfolding in Sanford, Fla., and across the nation.
Jerrod was shot and killed after he was stopped by police while driving his uncle's Cadillac outside a local school. Jerrod did not have a driver's license. In a split second, he decided to flee police, and his car headed toward the breezeway at the school when the rookie officer opened fire, striking Jerrod and killing him instantly. Eyewitness reports at the scene were mixed. The officer claimed that the car was speeding toward students; others said that there was nobody in the breezeway.
In a split second, a young life was lost, and the life of the rookie officer was forever changed. Our community changed as well.
Coping with racial issues
Delray Beach has struggled with issues of race for most of its 100-year history. We are a great community, and we have made enormous strides, winning national awards, redeveloping our downtown into one of the finest in the nation and improving neighborhoods and schools. But though we are a diverse community, we are also largely segregated into "white" and "black" neighborhoods. To this day, we still have two Little Leagues, one black, one white. Efforts have been made to integrate the leagues, but the historic minority league has resisted overtures to merge. Likewise, perceptions still linger about the safety of certain schools and neighborhoods that are simply not based on fact.
As mayor, I was determined to change the racial dynamic in our two-time "All America City." When we completed our master plan for the downtown, we adjusted the boundaries to include minority neighborhoods as part of the new definition of downtown.
We also launched a race relations initiative that included conversations called "study circles" that encouraged a deep exploration of the issues that have kept our community apart for decades.
I was criticized for opening Pandora's box by some in our community, but most people longed to connect with each other. When they did -- many for the first time -- they learned that they had more in common than not. They shared a desire for safe neighborhoods, a passion for their children to succeed, fears of crime and a yearning to connect with their neighbors -- to feel as if they could walk, drive, live, work and play comfortably in any neighborhood, regardless of their race or ethnicity.
An opportunity to be seized
Nothing can bring back Trayvon Martin. Nothing can bring back Jerrod Miller. The tragic loss of young men cannot be erased by any kind of civic effort.
But amidst the sadness and beyond the anger, there is opportunity. Opportunity for neighbors to discuss issues once considered forbidden. Opportunities for mayors, communities, police chiefs, teachers, parents and children to talk, connect and get to know each other's dreams, fears, concerns, challenges and aspirations.
We began that process in Delray Beach, even before Jerrod Miller's shooting. I think it saved us. Because despite the understandable anger, sadness, confusion and rage, we survived and in many ways grew closer as a community, although we still have a long way to go.
This is the opportunity that we as a nation have now. For our children's sake and safety, I pray we seize it.

'The Killing' takes another stab at solving murder; 
'There's a lot still to be learned' in second season

BYLINE: Carol Memmott, USA TODAY

SECTION: LIFE; Pg. 5D

LENGTH: 665 words

Who killed Rosie Larsen?
Hang in there, fans. AMC's The Killing is promising the answer -- just not right away.
Some TV-show finales shock audiences for what they reveal. This Seattle-based freshman crime drama was lambasted  last June for not revealing the solution to its overarching mystery, Rosie's killer, as most viewers expected. Instead, even more questions were left hanging.
The  13-episode second season starts Sunday (8 ET/PT) with a two-hour premiere.  Executive producer Veena Sud promises that the slow burn toward the revelation  will be worth the wait. 
"We were truly surprised by the level of expectation that viewers had for closure," Sud says. "None of us, certainly not I, certainly not the network -- none of us who created the show had any intention of misleading anyone."
The Killing is based on a Danish television series, Forbrydelsen, and Sud says this second season in many ways mirrors its source.  "We're trying to be very clear  that this investigation is modeled on the Danish series, which was a two-season arc,"  Sud says.  "We're going to solve the mystery of who killed Rosie Larsen at the end of Season 2."
The crime drama, which averaged a solid 2.2 million viewers for premiere episodes last season,  has been critically praised for its dark and moody atmosphere, as well as for stellar performances by Mireille Enos and Joel Kinnaman as the detectives hunting Rosie's killer. The series' strong focus on the destructive impact the teen's death has on her family also was lauded for sensitivity and realism.
Sunday's  opener picks up the moment Season 1 left off: Just-resigned homicide detective Sarah Linden (Enos) and her son had boarded a plane to California, where they planned to begin a new life. Just before takeoff, a  call brings Linden the realization that the arrest she and Stephen Holder (Kinnaman) made in Rosie's murder, of mayoral candidate Darren Richmond (Billy Campbell), may have been  based on false evidence.
At the same time, an unhinged Belko Royce (Brendan Sexton III), another suspect, gets  close to Richmond in a crowd outside the city jail and aims his gun. Season over.
"In the last moments of Season 1, we discover along with Sarah that she doesn't have the right man, or almost certainly doesn't have the right man," Enos says. "There is a larger conspiracy, and her partner may have been involved in it."
Enos, who earned Emmy and Golden Globe nominations for her portrayal of Linden, says she also was shocked by fans' frustrations. "The hope is that the audience isn't just watching to know who did it, but they're actually invested in the characters and the journey. It has been clear, shooting Season 2, that the journey had so much more depth and richness that needed to be explored," she says. "I have no doubt that once people show up for Season 2, they'll be glad there's more Rosie Larsen story line."
Season 1 was about questions, Sud says,  "about the reality of a murder investigation in the sense that the very first people you look at are people personally connected to the victim."
Season 2, she says,  will show  there's  more to be discovered.  "We'll learn more about the victim. Some secret people in her life will come forward. Secrets about her parents' past will be uncovered that may have  led to their daughter's death. There's a lot still to be learned about Rosie Larsen,  who we've only known for 13 days." (Each episode constitutes one day in the investigation.)
Then, Sud says, toward season's end, "and intricately woven into the journey that Sarah Linden takes in solving the murder, a new mystery will start to unfold" -- possibly laying the foundations for a Season 3.
Enos is confident -- and hopeful -- that fans will return. "I actually think the people who were the most angry at the end of last season will be the biggest champions for the show," she says. "I think their anger came out of feeling betrayed. And if they can just put that emotion back into the show, they're going to love it."

Mark Brown, The (London) Guardian: "Stress does funny things to us. So do circumstances beyond our control.  It's only when we get to the point that we can't cope that we know we can't cope. It's not hard to see in many cases of 'public meltdown' what you're looking at is someone who got so far in that there was no way of stepping back or stepping away from it. If there's one thing we know about having a public meltdown, it's that it's embarrassing. Every time you point and laugh, you're doing it at the expense of someone who got stuck in a situation they couldn't get out of until it was too much." 
Juan Williams, The Wall Street Journal: "The shooting death of Trayvon Martin in Florida has sparked national outrage.   But what about all the other young black murder victims? Nationally, nearly half of all murder victims are black. And the overwhelming majority of those black people are killed by other black people. Where is the march for them? Where is the march against the drug dealers who prey on young black people? Where is the march against bad schools, with their 50% dropout rate for black teenage boys?  While civil rights leaders have raised their voices to speak out against this one tragedy, few if any will do the same about the larger tragedy of daily carnage that is black-on-black crime."

Video shows no blood, bruises; 
Slain teen's dad says shooter's story is 'false'

The family of slain Florida teenager Trayvon Martin said Wednesday that a  police video showing  the shooter, George Zimmerman, arriving at the station for questioning discredits claims he acted in self-defense.
"It just shows that everything that Zimmerman has been saying, that the police have been reporting, is false," the teen's father, Tracy Martin, told USA TODAY as he watched  the video on television  in a Washington hotel Wednesday night.
ABC News said it obtained the police surveillance video, and it was replayed on other networks. Sanford police Sgt. David Morgenstern told the Associated Press  that the video  is of Zimmerman. 
"From what I saw, Zimmerman had no blood on his face, had no grass on the back of his clothes, no cuts on the back of his head," Martin  said.
Family attorney Benjamin Crump said the video and lack of evidence of a struggle knocks down Zimmerman's claim of self-defense  and shows officials botched their investigation.
"You're witnessing a conspiracy in the first degree," Crump said. "If they don't arrest this guy -- there's a conspiracy at this point."
The police surveillance video taken the night that Trayvon was shot dead, shows Zimmerman, 28,  arriving at the Sanford, Fla., police station in a police car, exiting with his hands cuffed behind his back and being led to questioning.
The 17-year-old's death has sparked a national conversation about racial profiling. Trayvon was fatally shot Feb. 26  after Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, followed him because he said  the teen looked suspicious.
Trayvon, who is black and wore a  hooded sweatshirt, was unarmed; Zimmerman is described by police as white; his family says he is Hispanic.
No charges have been filed against Zimmerman. He had  told police that Trayvon jumped him and smashed his head into the pavement. According to an initial police report, an officer noticed Zimmerman was bleeding from the nose and back of his head and  showed signs of having been in a struggle.
Crump said the national outpouring of outrage in the case won't stop until Zimmerman is arrested.
"I think the people aren't going anywhere," he said referring to the growing  online petitions,  gatherings and social media campaigns.
Among the displays of support Wednesday was that from Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill., who was escorted off the U.S. House floor for wearing a hoodie as he protested the shooting. The lawmaker called for a full investigation into Trayvon's death.
"Racial profiling has to stop," Rush said on the House floor. "Just because someone wears a hoodie does not make them a hoodlum."
The congressman, wearing the hoodie again, said later in a CNN interview that "life is much more than a piece of clothing."
The House has strict rules about what lawmakers can wear on the floor. Rep. Greg Harper, R-Miss., who was presiding over the chamber when Rush was speaking, banged the gavel repeatedly and reminded him of rules that prohibit the wearing of hats in the chamber while the House is in session.
Harper said wearing a hoodie was "not consistent with this rule." Rush was escorted out.
The hoodie has become a symbol of support for Trayvon. Miami Heat stars LeBron James and Dwyane Wade and their teammates wore hooded sweatshirts in pictures  as part of the "We Are Trayvon" campaign.
Tens of thousands of people have posted pictures of themselves wearing hoodies on Twitter, Facebook and other social media.
Zimmerman's lawyer and friends have spoken in defense of the neighborhood watch volunteer, saying he is not a racist. He has dropped from sight since the killing and has not made any public remarks.
Despite the police decision not to charge Zimmerman at the time, several other probes are ongoing. The U.S. Justice Department has opened an investigation, and a Seminole County, Fla., grand jury is  considering possible charges. The grand jury is likely to convene April 10.
More than 30,000 people signed an NAACP petition to Florida prosecutors in just a 24-hour period.

James to play with injury

BYLINE: By Jeff Zillgitt and J. Michael Falgoust

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 8C

LENGTH: 560 words

Depending on who is answering
the question, Miami Heat
forward LeBron James might
have dislocated his left ring finger
during Monday's 105-90
loss at the Indiana Pacers.
James said Wednesday that
he dislocated it and popped the
finger back into place. Heat 
coach Erik Spoelstra said
James' finger wasn't dislocated.
An X-ray revealed no break,
and James will play today vs.
the Dallas Mavericks.
"He practiced today, and he's
ready to go, and he had a very
good practice, a physical practice,"
Spoelstra said. "If he can
get through a practice like this,
he can get through any game."
James was hurt in the first
quarter Monday. He had the finger
taped, returned to the game
and finished with 24 points and
nine rebounds.
Miami, however, is more concerned
about going 8-6 this
month, losing two games in a
row three times.
"Every team goes through
this. Sometimes you have slippage,"
Spoelstra said. "And this
season's been a challenge for
everybody. It's not an excuse.
. . . In the last three weeks on
the road, we have not been able
to consistently play with energy
or efficiency."
Bynum benched: Los Angeles
Lakers coach Mike Brown
benched star Kobe Bryant, having
an off shooting game, in the
fourth quarter of Sunday's loss
to the Memphis Grizzlies.
He followed by benching Andrew
Bynum in Tuesday's win
vs. the Golden State Warriors
after the 7-foot center clanked a
three-pointer with 16 seconds
left on the shot clock early in
the third quarter. Bynum did
not return until the start of the
fourth quarter.
Bynum later said he would do
it again. He hit his only threepointer
of the season in eight
tries in the loss to Memphis.
"I don't know what was
bench-worthy about the shot, to
be honest with you," Bynum
said. "I made one (vs. Memphis),
and I wanted to make another
one. I swear, that's it. I guess he
took offense to it."
After Wednesday's practice,
Brown defended his move.
"That's something (the threepointer)
that I felt could've taken
us out of rhythm, and that's
why I took him out of the
game," Brown said.
He added that Bynum, who
wasn't available to news reporters,
had a great practice.
Stoudemire out: Just when
the New York Knicks started to
get the production from Amar'e
Stoudemire that they needed,
they have lost the forward for
two to four weeks with a bulging
disk in his lower back.
Stoudemire, who missed
Monday's win against the Milwaukee
Bucks, won't have surgery
now and could return for
the last nine games. If it's four
weeks, he would be available for
the first round of the playoffs if
the Knicks qualify.
The Knicks are 2½ games
ahead of the Bucks for the last
playoff spot in the Eastern Conference
after routing the Orlando
Magic 108-86 Wednesday.
Ankle woes: Stephen Curry's
right ankle still isn't 100%,
and the Golden State Warriors
guard could miss the rest of the
season.
Curry saw a specialist in Los
Angeles this week and will return
in two weeks for an evaluation
that will determine if he
can play again this season.
He had surgery on the ankle
in the offseason, has rolled it or
injured his foot several times
and last played March 11.
First-year coach Mark Jackson's
guarantee that the Warriors
would be a playoff team
with a Curry-Monta Ellis backcourt
became moot when Ellis
was dealt to the Bucks at the
trading deadline. Now the starting
point guard will come from
among career backup Nate
Robinson, Charles Jenkins and
rookie Klay Thompson; Robinson
started Wednesday.
The Warriors have made the
playoffs once since 1994.

Power of pilots in cockpit scrutinized

BYLINE: Bart Jansen

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 2A

LENGTH: 316 words

After the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, airline pilots gained more authority and independence: They sit behind locked cockpit doors, can carry guns and are starting to  bypass regular airport security lines. 
The authority, which pilots had sought, has worked well so far to protect control of a plane and its passengers by leaving it in the hands of the captain and co-pilot.
But a bizarre incident Tuesday, when JetBlue Airways captain Clayton Osbon was subdued by passengers after raving about 9/11 and terrorists, prompts questions about vesting so much power in pilots.
Checks and balances for pilots include medical screenings and having fellow crewmembers keep an eye on one another's physical and mental fitness. Many flight security experts say that these steps are sufficient and that the incident shouldn't be used to undermine an airline pilot's authority.
"Someone has to be absolutely in charge," says Anthony Roman, a trained pilot and head of Roman & Associates, a global security and risk management firm in Texas.
Until Tuesday, Osbon, 49, enjoyed a good professional reputation. He flew 12 years for JetBlue. His airline's CEO, Dave Barger, praised him as "a consummate professional."
Osbon's co-pilot, Jason Dowd of Salem, Ohio, safely landed in Amarillo after locking Osbon out of the cockpit. While  officials praised Dowd's handling of the bizarre situation, the incident was troubling.
Randall Larsen, a former Air Force officer who is director of the Institute for Homeland Security, urged a thorough investigation in case the incident stemmed from an untreated or poorly treated medical problem.
"The question to me was was the pilot on medication or was he off medication or was it something to do with something else," Larsen said.
"If it were just a mental breakdown, that's one thing -- but that is really a frightening thing," he said.

'If y'all come to et me, bring body bags'; 
Texas standoff is emblematic of the nation's growing anti-government sovereign movement.

BYLINE: Kevin Johnson, USA TODAY

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 1A

LENGTH: 1879 words

TRINIDAD, Texas
Gary Thomas will never forget the letter he received in early 2000. It was from John Joe Gray, a suspect in a felony assault case, offering a not-so-subtle warning to the area's chief criminal investigator: He had no intention of answering charges that he had attacked a state trooper.
"What he said was this: 'If y'all come to get me, bring body bags,'" said Thomas, now a local justice of the peace.
Thomas remembers the message clearly, not because of its unvarnished threat, but because -- after 12 years -- Gray, who doesn't acknowledge the authority of any government, continues to dare police to come and get him. 
Sequestered on a 50-acre, wooded compound in East Texas since jumping bail more than a decade ago, Gray and his clan have effectively outlasted the administrations of four local sheriffs, all of whom have decided that John Joe's arrest is not worth the risk of a violent confrontation.
"The risk of loss of life on both ends is far too great," said Anderson County District Attorney Doug Lowe, who first sought to prosecute Gray for the alleged Christmas Eve 1999 assault of Texas Trooper Jim Cleland. "I believed it then; I still feel that way."
The stalemate, perhaps the longest-running standoff in the U.S. between law enforcement and a fugitive living in plain sight, is also emblematic of what the FBI believes is a troubling re-emergence of an anti-government movement that vaulted to notoriety in 1995. Then, one of its disaffected sympathizers, Timothy McVeigh -- angered by the government's botched 1993 raid of the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas -- detonated a truck bomb outside the  Oklahoma City federal building, killing  168 people in what was at the time the deadliest terrorist attack on U.S. soil.
In the past three years, there has been growing concern over activities of so-called "sovereign citizens," who like the Grays and many of their anti-government predecessors "claim to exist beyond the realm of government authority," according to a January FBI bulletin to state and local law enforcement officials warning of the  potential for violence.
The sovereign movement, estimated by the Southern Poverty Law Center to number 100,000 ardent followers and about 200,000 sympathizers across the country, is rooted in an ideology that rejects government authority at its most basic levels, from its power to tax to the enforcement of criminal laws, including common traffic regulations. The law center, which tracks extremist groups in the USA, based its estimates partly on its reviews of tax disputes and court documents involving people who do not recognize government authority.
Although the FBI does not track sovereigns by number, the bureau does not dispute the law center's estimates, which have swelled dramatically within a national anti-government network of related "patriot" and "militia'' groups. Since 2008, the number of groups surged from 149 to 1,274 in 2011, the law center reported this month.
The rapid growth, according to the law center, has been fueled by a collision of factors, from the troubles related to the struggling economy and foreclosure crisis to the election of President Obama, the nation's first black president. Obama's election prompted a "backlash" from extremist groups who were further angered by decisions to provide government assistance to Wall Street banks and automakers, the law center found.
Stuart McArthur, deputy assistant director of the FBI's Counterterrorism Division, said the sovereigns have become more active in seeking retaliation against government officials by filing fraudulent lawsuits and liens, seeking billions of dollars in judgments. The actions often follow arrests, evictions, court rulings and other interactions with authorities.
At its most extreme, McArthur said, sovereigns have been linked to threats of violence and the murders of six police officers since 2002, including the slayings of officers Brandon Paudert and Bill Evans in West Memphis, Ark., in 2010.
"There are people at war with this country who are not international terrorists," said Robert Paudert, the former chief of the West Memphis Police Department and the father of one of the slain officers. "I had never heard of the sovereign citizen movement before May 20, 2010 (the day of his son's murder). But these are people who are willing to kill or be killed for their beliefs."
At Gray's property line
At the end of a rutted, dirt-gravel road, about 70 miles southeast of Dallas, sits John Joe Gray.
It doesn't take long to learn that Gray and his family, after more than 12 years of living in isolation without electricity and modern plumbing, have no intention of surrendering to local authorities or engaging in much discussion about their plight.
A heavily armed patrol of three men -- each carrying holstered handguns, knives and rifles -- meets visitors one late February afternoon at the family's property line, a fence line festooned with weathered placards bearing anti-government slogans.
"When people fear the government, there is tyranny. When government fears the people, there is freedom," reads one. Another: "Vaccinations equal Annihilation."
Although the three confirm to USA TODAY during a recent visit  that they are members of the Gray family, they refuse to provide their full names. The oldest -- a bearded man with a mane of long, wiry hair who most resembles Gray's 12-year-old booking photo -- said the family is not interested in discussing why they continue to defy authorities. Nor are they inclined to say how long they can hold out.
"We're doing all right," the older man said curtly, adding that the family tends a sizable garden on the property that yields much of their food. A herd of goats, fish from the adjacent Trinity River and wild game help fill their pantry.
For the duration of the brief exchange, a stilted conversation at the fence line, the older bearded man does much of the talking as the others look on, their weapons hanging from worn gun belts and shoulder slings. The weapons, he said, are necessary to keep "trespassers" off their land, suggesting that would include unwelcome visits from law enforcement. He is most adamant, though, in his refusal to discuss the circumstances that have resulted in his unusual standoff with local law enforcement.
"Everybody knows the government controls the media," he said.
Gray fled here, according to Thomas, Lowe and Henderson County Sheriff Ray Nutt, after the now-63-year-old man was released on bond in connection with the 1999 alleged assault on Trooper  Cleland.
During a routine traffic stop in neighboring Anderson County, Thomas said Cleland saw a .357-caliber handgun in the car and reached for it, sparking a struggle  with Gray that spilled onto the roadway. During the struggle, Thomas said, Gray "bit a plug" of flesh out of Cleland's arm.
A search of the vehicle produced some rambling anti-government writings, including references to setting off a bomb on a highway overpass near Dallas.
Gray denied any part in a bomb plot; he was indicted, instead, for the alleged assault. Gray was released on bond, partly on his promise that he would have no access to weapons while free awaiting a hearing.  Gray never returned to answer the charge.
Nutt, the fourth sheriff to hold office in the county where Gray is holed up, said he is comfortable not forcing Gray's hand. That decision, he said, is largely informed by the consequences of the federal raid on a Waco compound housing the Branch Davidian religious sect and its leader, David Koresh. Federal agents stormed the property in search of weapons in February 1993, leading to a 51-day standoff, ending in a conflagration that left 80 dead and inspired McVeigh. The specter of that tragedy still looms large here, where the Gray property lies about 80 miles east of Waco.
"I'm reluctant to talk about (the Gray case) much," said Nutt, a former Texas Ranger who was dispatched to Waco at the time. "I just don't want to stir things up."
That's not to say Nutt has ignored the current standoff. A thick file holds a pile of documents related to the Grays. It's believed that seven children live among the 15 people on the property, the sheriff said. Nutt won't discuss any law enforcement surveillance of the compound, although they know sympathizers occasionally drop off food and supplies. The sheriff also believes the family has access to a ham radio, maybe a generator.
The sheriff is not comfortable discussing much more, except to emphasize the strong belief that his department would not have the "firepower" to sustain a prolonged siege to forcibly remove Gray.
"Some of our officers would be killed, mostly likely," he said.
No taxation
Mark Potok, editor of the Southern Poverty Law Center's Intelligence Report, which has closely examined the Gray case, said the family adheres to sovereign beliefs, an ideology that is attracting an increasing number of followers in the U.S.
The sovereigns are regarded as a subset of the patriot groups and share much of the same ideology, including a rejection of the government's taxing authority. The Grays, according to local court records, owe nearly $20,000 in back property taxes. Citing the same fears expressed by law enforcement officials, the county has stopped attempts at collection.
"This is a widespread ideology," the FBI's McArthur said.
Potok and other analysts believe the financial crisis, triggered partly by the collapse of the housing market, is chiefly responsible for the movement's expansion.
This notion is based on a flurry of federal prosecutions against so-called "tax defiers," suspects in debt elimination schemes and others who have sought to enrich themselves or retaliate against local government officials by filing false property liens and lawsuits seeking outrageous monetary judgments.
Last summer, two New York men, Ed Parenteau, 54, and Jeffrey Burfeindt, 48, pleaded guilty in federal court to attaching fraudulent liens against personal and public property, totaling $135 billion. The motive, according to court records: The pair was "displeased" after local police arrested them on simple trespassing charges.
This week, David Stone, 47, and his son, Joshua Stone, 23, both members of the Hutaree militia, pleaded guilty in a Michigan federal court to possessing illegal machine guns, after a judge dismissed more serious charges that they and other militia members had plotted to kill police officers as part of an anti-government effort.
The danger ahead
In wake of his son's murder, Paudert, the former West Memphis police chief, is now assisting the Justice Department in a national campaign to prepare law enforcement officials for potential violent encounters with sovereign followers.
Had such information been available in 2010, Paudert said his officers might have recognized the looming danger when avowed sovereign Jerry Kane and his son, Joe, presented them with unusual paperwork indicating the vehicle was registered to the "Kingdom of Heaven."
Minutes later, the Kanes opened fire on the officers and sped away, leaving young Paudert's body on a freeway exit ramp and Evans in a nearby ditch. The Kanes were later killed in a confrontation with police.
"I wish I could have done more to prepare them for what they faced that day," Paudert said.

Don't call it 'pink slime'; 3 governors tour plant

BYLINE: John Bacon with staff and wire reports

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 624 words

Governors of three states donned hair nets and goggles Thursday to tour a Nebraska plant that makes what critics have dubbed "pink slime," trying to convince consumers the textured beef product is safe.
Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback and Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, all Republicans, visited the Beef Products Inc. plant in South Sioux City to see how the  product is made from beef trimmings. The company has halted operations at plants in their states amid criticism that the product is an unappetizing example of industrialized food production. The product meets federal safety standards, but Kroger, Safeway and other large grocery chains are no longer using it in their beef. "It's beef, but it's leaner beef, which is better for you," Branstad said.
Some near wildfire never got warning 
Some residents in the path of a Colorado wildfire that left two people dead and destroyed 27 homes weren't warned to flee because of a problem in a new automated call system.
Jefferson County sheriff's spokeswoman Jacki Kelley said about 12% of the hundreds of people who should have received the calls Monday did not, probably because of a software glitch.
FirstCall Network, which handles the call system, said it worked exactly as it should. The 12% represents those who had disconnected numbers or didn't answer, President Matthew Teague said.
Michigan militia trial ends quietly
A Michigan militia leader and his son pleaded guilty to illegally possessing a machine gun, ending a federal terror trial two days after five co-defendants were cleared of all charges.
Federal prosecutors were dealt a major blow Tuesday when Judge Victoria Roberts acquitted all seven Hutaree militia members of plotting a violent revolt against the  government with weapons of mass destruction. Gun charges against David Stone and son Joshua were all that remained. David Stone  faces 33 to 48 months in prison under a plea deal. Joshua Stone faces 27-33 months. Sentencing is in August.
--Tresa Baldas and Joe Swickard, Detroit Free Press
Mine official pleads guilty to fraud
The former superintendent of a West Virginia mine where an explosion in April 2010 killed 29 workers pleaded guilty to a federal fraud charge.
Gary May, the highest-ranking Massey Energy official charged, faces up to five years in prison when sentenced Aug. 9 for conspiracy to defraud the federal government. He was accused of manipulating the ventilation system during inspections of the Upper Big Branch mine to fool safety officials and disabled a methane monitor on a cutting machine a few months before the blast.
Spaceport runway must be extended
The nearly 2-mile-long runway at Spaceport America in southern New Mexico will have to be extended to accommodate Virgin Galactic's rocket-powered spacecraft, Spaceport officials said.
The New Mexico Spaceport Authority voted to extend the runway 2,000 more feet. Spaceport America is the world's first terminal, hangar and runway built  for commercial space travel.
Virgin Galactic determined through tests that more room would be needed for landings under certain circumstances. "It's really being done for safety," Spaceport spokesman David Wilson said.
The extension will cost $7million, Wilson said, and will come from  the Spaceport's $209million taxpayer-financed budget.
Sandusky trial delayed until June
The trial of former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky, charged with 52 criminal counts involving child sexual abuse, has been delayed three weeks, a Pennsylvania judge said.
Judge John Cleland rescheduled the trial for June 5, citing "various logistical contingencies." A pre-trial hearing April 5, at which Sandusky's lawyers will attempt to have the charges thrown out, will go on as scheduled.--Kevin Johnson

Video in Fla. killing is raising questions

BYLINE: Donna Leinwand Leger and Melanie Eversley, USA TODAY

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 417 words

Forensic experts say newly released video by police of the man who shot Trayvon Martin raises more questions than it answers -- but that's not stopping droves of amateur sleuths on TV, Twitter and Facebook from scrutinizing it anyway. 
"I think the public should not draw any conclusions from this at all," said Grant Fredericks, who once headed the forensic video unit for the Vancouver (British Columbia) Police Department.
The video should be just a fraction of the evidence available to police as they investigate George Zimmerman's claim that he shot and killed Trayvon, 17, after the teenager allegedly punched the neighborhood watch volunteer  in the nose and slammed his head against the ground,  Fredericks said.
The Feb. 26 shooting in Sanford, Fla., has brought national attention because Trayvon's family claims Zimmerman killed the unarmed youth after racially stereotyping him. Trayvon was black. Police say Zimmerman is white; his family says he is Hispanic.
Zimmerman's brother, Robert Zimmerman Jr., told CNN Thursday that reports his brother  was chasing the teen  are "absolutely false" and that he "was not patrolling the neighborhood. He was going to a store, Target."
Robert Zimmerman said  the voice heard screaming on 911 tapes is that of his brother, who acted to save his own life.  He said George Zimmerman "was very disappointed that none of the neighbors had come out" to help him.  He said his brother would have been dead "if he had not acted decisively and instantaneously.''
The police security camera video shows Zimmerman exiting a patrol car and entering the Sanford Police Department  about 35 minutes after the shooting. Images  of Zimmerman's head and face reveal no obvious cuts or gashes, but at one point, a police officer inspects the back of his head. Zimmerman's lawyer, Craig Sonner, told NBC's Today the video supports his client's story because the officer may have been looking at an injury.
The public weighed in on social media sites. Many  expressed disbelief at Zimmerman's claim that  he fired  in self-defense, and pointed to the grainy video as proof.
Trayvon's family and supporters say Zimmerman's lack of apparent injury in the video shows  he lied about the teen attacking him.
Forensic video expert David Notowitz, founder of the National Center for Audio and Video Forensics, says much work remains before investigators can draw evidence from the video.  "Right now, people are jumping to frantic conclusions," he said.

Florida teen death stirs deep anger

SECTION: EDIT; Pg. 11A

LENGTH: 608 words

Jelani Cobb, on The New Yorker: "The shooting death of Trayvon Martin (black, male, 17, unarmed save for a packet of candy and a bottle of iced tea) did not so much raise questions as it confirmed suspicions: that we remain stratified or at best striated by race, that 'innocent' is a relative term, that black male lives can end under capricious circumstances, and that justice is in the eye of the beholder -- ideas that are as cynical as they are applicable. At this juncture, events in Sanford, Fla., suggest the benefit of the doubt in the shooting of a black teenager extends even to unauthorized, untrained, weapon-toting private citizens who pursue unarmed pedestrians." 
Heather Mac Donald, on National Review Online: "Protesters in Florida and across the country are right to demand an explanation for the decision not to charge Zimmerman. A critical examination of Florida's 'stand your ground' law is absolutely warranted. But the racial storyline that has been imposed on the shooting does not fairly represent contemporary America.  Family breakdown, not white racism, is the biggest impediment facing blacks today, producing such casualties as the 18-year-old gangbanger who fatally shot a 34-year-old mother picking up her child from school in Brownsville, Brooklyn, last October. (Al) Sharpton and the national media didn't show up for that killing, just as they don't for the thousands of other black-on-black killings each year."
Joan Walsh, on Salon: "Whether or not Martin was wearing a hoodie, or had ever used marijuana; whether or not he and Zimmerman had an altercation that night: at minimum, the cops botched this investigation, and didn't do anything like what should have been required in a case when an unarmed 17-year-old shows up dead. That's the bottom line here.  Martin didn't have to be a polo-and-khakis-wearing Boy Scout to have his rights respected.  The family and their many supporters have cobbled together a movement to demand justice, and they've used the facts they had.  Had the cops done their job, they wouldn't have had to."
Michelle Goldberg, on The Daily Beast: "Like a rape victim, Martin's past is being excavated for evidence that he might have provoked the harm done to him. But as of right now, some things are not in dispute. Martin was unarmed save for a pack of Skittles and an ice tea. George Zimmerman, who repeatedly called the cops when he saw young black men in his gated community, trailed Martin after the police advised him not to. He called Martin either a 'coon' or a 'goon'. Martin had no documented history of violence. Zimmerman, on the other hand, was previously accused of hitting his ex-fiance.  So why this desire to paint Martin, rather than the man who shot him, as the guilty party?  Some on the right are deeply invested in the idea that anti-black racism is no longer much of a problem in the United States, and certainly not a problem on the scale of false accusations of racism."
Gail Collins, in The New York Times: "Whenever there is a terrible shooting incident somewhere in America, our politicians talk about everything except whether the tragedy could have been avoided if the gunman had not been allowed to carry a firearm.  There is a serious trend toward states letting their residents carry concealed weapons with no more background check than you need to carry a concealed nutcracker. All of this is based on the gun rights lobby's argument that the more armed law-abiding people we have on our streets, the safer everybody will be. Under this line of thinking,  Zimmerman's gated community was safer because Zimmerman was driving around with his legal gun."

Indulge your need for speed 
"Who wants to go fast?" the instructor at Exotics Racing asks the dozen men and three women signed up for a session to drive dream cars on a course next to the Las Vegas Motor Speedway. Hands shoot up. Out on the 1.4-mile track in a $265,000 2011 Lamborghini Gallardo LP 570-4 Superleggera  -- a "Lambo" to car buffs -- I use a paddle shift on the steering wheel as a pro in the passenger seat gives step-by-step instructions. Unlike most roaring around the course, with an ambulance parked close by, I insist on staying under 125 mph. That changes when I step into a yellow Corvette Z06 for a two-lap, $99 "ride-along" with former test driver Rudy Ibaez, 27. He's known for making customers scream. "Oh. My. Gawwwddd! No, no, no," I shriek as he barrels down a straightaway, then "drifts" (sliding sideways around a turn). If you're not shaken and stirred at the end of this experience, you don't have a pulse. Exotics Racing, founded by two Frenchmen -- a former investment banker and a race-car driver -- claims to have the largest fleet of pricey, exotic cars available to the public. For $199 and up, you can take the wheel of two dozen Ferraris, Porsches and more, and buy videos of your performance courtesy of in-car cameras.

Bring out the big guns
Shooting galleries have a big target audience in Vegas, with so many thrill-seekers. At The Gun Store, I pull a trigger for the first time. With the aid of a laser sight atop an AK-47, I pound bullets into the chest of a scary villain on a poster. At new Machine Guns Vegas, modeled after an ultralounge (without alcohol), I view the VIP area with private lanes, meet a gun "hostess" with cleavage and cartridge belt, fire rat-a-tat rounds on an HK MP5 submachine gun. I didn't try an M60, the machine gun on steroids used by Rambo, or an M203 grenade launcher. Adrenaline rushes start at $50 for multigun packages at The Gun Store (you can have a $500 "shotgun wedding"); $89.95 at Machine Guns Vegas. Cheaper one-gun or kids' options are available at both venues.

Dig This is billed as the USA's largest sandbox. Customers unearth the secrets of manipulating an excavator and bulldozer, paying $249 and up to do so on a big dirt lot. "This is a bucket list town," where visitors seek experiences they can't have at home, says Dig This operations manager Amber Smith, a former heavy-equipment operator with a cheery demeanor and lavender-lacquered nails. Surprisingly, women 55-70 are "our biggest-selling group," she says. For years, they've seen men on machines at construction sites, never dreaming they could ever be in the driver's seat. Indeed, sitting in a behemoth that awaits your commands is a rush. Three hours on both the excavator and dozer cost $449. And a "Dig & Destroy" package adds a shooting session at the Guns and Ammo Garage.

Set sail on Titanic
Take to the sea in the desert via Titanic: The Artifact Exhibition at the Luxor casino resort. Pay the entrance fee ($32 non-resident adults, $24 children 4-12, plus service charge) and get a boarding card with the name of a passenger on the doomed 1912 Atlantic crossing. I was Mrs. Gertrude Kimball, traveling first class. And like every visitor, I had to wait till exhibit's end to see if I survived. As bagpipes, Viennese waltzes and ship horns sound in various exhibition rooms, visitors view re-creations of cabins and artifacts including White Star Line china, passengers' belongings and ship fittings -- even a replica of an iceberg that's creepily cold to the touch. The centerpiece is a 15-ton piece of Titanic's starboard hull, pulled from the ocean floor. Before exiting, customers with cards in hand scan the list of the dead, saved and missing. Whew: Mrs. Kimball (and her husband) escaped.

See a blast from the past
Most visitors are surprised to learn Vegas is home to the National Atomic Testing Museum, affiliated with Washington's Smithsonian Institution. Here, the serious-minded tour exhibits about development of the nuclear bomb and Nevada's history as a testing site. Players poured out of casinos in the early '50s to see explosions. An "Area 51" exhibit, which costs extra, just opened.  Museum admission: $14, non-resident adults; $11, kids 7-17.

Commune with nature
Vegas is surrounded by natural wonders, from Death Valley to Red Rock Canyon. Closer to the Strip is tranquil The Springs Preserve, where visitors view local flora and fauna on interpretive trails. A cafe affiliated with the Culinary Academy of Las Vegas has panoramic views of the city and the anti-Vegas buffet: a healthy salad bar with homemade soup. On weekends, rent a bike or bring the kids for activities including learning about live birds of prey. Children also like the space exhibit. A new Nevada State Museum is open Fridays to Mondays. Admission to Preserve attractions is $18.95, non-resident adults, $10.95 for children 5-17.

Don't call it 'pink slime'; 3 governors tour plant

BYLINE: John Bacon with staff and wire reports

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 624 words

Governors of three states donned hair nets and goggles Thursday to tour a Nebraska plant that makes what critics have dubbed "pink slime," trying to convince consumers the textured beef product is safe.
Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback and Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, all Republicans, visited the Beef Products Inc. plant in South Sioux City to see how the  product is made from beef trimmings. The company has halted operations at plants in their states amid criticism that the product is an unappetizing example of industrialized food production. The product meets federal safety standards, but Kroger, Safeway and other large grocery chains are no longer using it in their beef. "It's beef, but it's leaner beef, which is better for you," Branstad said.
Some near wildfire never got warning 
Some residents in the path of a Colorado wildfire that left two people dead and destroyed 27 homes weren't warned to flee because of a problem in a new automated call system.
Jefferson County sheriff's spokeswoman Jacki Kelley said about 12% of the hundreds of people who should have received the calls on Monday did not, probably because of a software glitch. Kelley said officials were reviewing the system to see what went wrong. More than 500 firefighters were fighting the blaze Thursday.
Michigan militia trial ends quietly
A Michigan militia leader and his son pleaded guilty to illegally possessing a machine gun, ending a federal terror trial two days after five co-defendants were cleared of all charges.
Federal prosecutors were dealt a major blow Tuesday when Judge Victoria Roberts acquitted all seven Hutaree militia members of plotting a violent revolt against the U.S. government with weapons of mass destruction. Gun charges against David Stone and son Joshua were all that remained. David Stone  faces 33 to 48 months in prison under a plea deal. Joshua Stone faces 27-33 months. Both have served two years and were freed pending sentencing in August.

Mine official pleads guilty to fraud
The former superintendent of a West Virginia mine where an explosion in April 2010 killed 29 workers pleaded guilty to a federal fraud charge.
Gary May, the highest-ranking Massey Energy official charged, faces up to five years in prison when sentenced Aug. 9 for conspiracy to defraud the federal government. He was accused of manipulating the ventilation system during inspections of the Upper Big Branch mine to fool safety officials and disabled a methane monitor on a cutting machine a few months before the blast.
Faith-based pantry back in good graces
A faith-based Indiana food pantry was reinstated into the federal Emergency Food Assistance Program -- and will be allowed to continue asking recipients if they want to pray.
Community Provisions of Jackson County will receive free food items through the program. State officials earlier this month removed the pantry from the program after founder Paul Brock refused to end the long-standing practice in which volunteers asked if they could pray with the recipients. Previously, pantry workers asked about praying after recipients filled out an application for food assistance. Now, they will wait until after recipients get their the food.

Sandusky trial delayed until June
The trial of former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky, charged with 52 criminal counts involving child sexual abuse, has been delayed three weeks, a Pennsylvania judge said.
Judge John Cleland rescheduled the trial for June 5, citing "various logistical contingencies." A pre-trial hearing April 5, at which Sandusky's lawyers will attempt to have the charges thrown out, will go on as scheduled.--Kevin Johnson

Video in Fla. killing is raising questions

BYLINE: Donna Leinwand Leger and Melanie Eversley, USA TODAY

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 405 words

Forensic experts say newly released video by police of the man who shot Trayvon Martin raises more questions than it answers -- but that's not stopping droves of amateur sleuths on TV, Twitter and Facebook from scrutinizing it anyway. 
"I think the public should not draw any conclusions from this at all," said Grant Fredericks, a former police officer who headed the forensic video unit for the Vancouver Police Department.
The video should be just a fraction of the evidence available to police as they investigate George Zimmerman's claim that he shot and killed Trayvon, 17, after the teenager punched him in the nose, pushed him to the ground and slammed his head against the pavement, Fredericks said.
The Feb. 26 shooting in Sanford, Fla., has brought national attention because of Trayvon's family's claims that Zimmerman killed the unarmed youth after racially stereotyping. Trayvon is black; Zimmerman is described by police as white, and his family says he is Hispanic.
The police security camera video shows Zimmerman exiting a patrol car and entering the Sanford Police Department. It begins at 7:52p.m., about 35 minutes after the fatal shooting. Shots of Zimmerman's head and face reveal no obvious cuts or gashes, but at one point, a police officer inspects the back of his head.
The public weighed in on social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter.
Many people expressed disbelief at Zimmerman's claim that Trayvon attacked him and he fired his gun in self-defense, and pointed to the grainy video as proof.
The video available to the public is highly compressed, which degrades the images, and is distorted, which makes Zimmerman appear thinner, Fredericks said.
"The public is seeing a picture of Zimmerman that's not accurate," he said.
Trayvon's family and supporters say Zimmerman's lack of apparent injury in the video is proof he lied about the teen attacking him. National Urban League president Marc Morial said on Current TV said the video "impeaches the story that George Zimmerman is floating that somehow he was injured."
Forensic video expert David Notowitz, founder of the National Center for Audio and Video Forensics, says much work remains before investigators can draw evidence from the video.
"Right now, people are jumping to frantic conclusions," he said. "Mr. Zimmerman may be totally innocent. He may have reason for doing what he did. He also might be guilty -- but the evidence is not there yet."
